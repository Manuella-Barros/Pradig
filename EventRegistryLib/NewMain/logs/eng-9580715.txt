At the unveiling, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella unveiled \"Copilot+\" PCs. Nadella says Microsoft, with the help of Dell Technologies, Qualcomm, Intel and Advanced Micro Devices will build the new devices, which are going to be the \"fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever built\".\n\nIn the event, held on its campus in Redmond, Washington, Nadella listed a few of the salient features that will be seen in the new range of Microsoft computers -- Copilot+.\n\nEquipped with the Snapdragon X Series, Copilot+ PCs are optimised to run AI workloads locally with better performance, featuring 8 high performance cores and 4 efficiency optimised cores in the built-in CPU within the X Elite.\n\nOne of the top most features is called Recall. In this feature, users will help find files and other data that they have seen on the PC. This is a new feature which will be introduced in Windows 11. The tool will help keep track of everything the user sees and does on the computer. In return, the user will give the ability to search and retrieve anything you have done on the device.\n\nAt the event, Microsoft also revealed the voice of its Copilot+ voice assistance. The company demonstrated it as a real-time virtual coach to a user playing the \"Minecraft\" video game.\n\nThis new model of computer is expected to meet the minimum standards of processing power and performance. Microsoft's representatives stated in the event that the most compelling reason to upgrade your PC with Copilot+ PC is faster AI assistants that run directly on a PC.\n\nIt has also been indicated that the other AI features will be similar to the Ultrabook category of thin form Windows laptops that Intel promoted with PC manufacturers in 2011.\n\nThey added that Copilot+ will soon be in harmony with the latest OpenAI technology -- GPT 4o. With all the features, Microsoft indicated that the new Copilot+ will be on the expensive side.\n\nApart from Copilot+, Microsoft also introduced a new generation of Surface Pro tablet and Surface Laptop. These new device will feature Qualcomm chips supported by Arms Holdings' architecture.\n\nMicrosoft also spoke about a new technology called Prism. This tech, as explained by the company, will help software written for Intel and AMD chips run chips made with Arm tech.\n\nAddressing an event before the start of its annual developer conference, Microsoft aims to make a comeback in the race of AI. The partnership of AI with computers will help the company to be at the forefront as their competitors like Apple.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surface Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrabook", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ultrabook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202405/microsoft-unveils-copilot-pcs-211456245-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=IlH7T5FAi20Y3fD9CPsNQPkWlVq48Kxt", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

At the press event, he said faster AI assistants that run directly on a PC will be \"the most compelling reason to upgrade your PC in a long time.\"\n\nGlobal PC shipments dipped about 15% to 242 million last year, according to research firm Gartner, which suggests Microsoft expects the new category of computers to account for around one-fifth of all PCs sold.\n\n\"People just need to be convinced that the device experience alone justifies this entirely new category of Copilot+ machines,\" said analyst Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies.\n\nMicrosoft's new \"Copilot+\" computer marketing category that highlights AI features is reminiscent of the \"Ultrabook\" category of thin-form Windows laptops that Intel promoted with PC manufacturers in 2011 to compete against Apple's MacBook Air.\n\nMicrosoft executives also said that GPT-4o, the latest technology from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, will \"soon\" be available as part of Copilot.\n\nMicrosoft also introduced a new generation of its own Surface Pro tablet and Surface Laptop that feature Qualcomm chips based on Arm Holdings' architecture. It also introduced a technology called Prism that will help software written for Intel and AMD chips run on chips made with Arm technology.\n\nMicrosoft showed its new devices in action against an Apple device, showing photo editing software from Adobe running faster on the Microsoft device. Apple earlier this month showed a new AI-focused chip that analysts expect to be used in future laptops.\n\nAfter Intel's processors dominated the PC market for decades, Qualcomm and other makers of lower-power Arm components have tried to compete in the Windows-PC market.\n\nThe Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chips include a so-called neural processing unit designed to accelerate AI-focused applications, such as Microsoft's Copilot software.\n\nMicrosoft held the product event a day before its annual developer conference.\n\nMicrosoft aims to extend its early advantage in the race to produce AI tools that consumers are willing to pay for. Its partnership with OpenAI allowed it to jump ahead of Alphabet as they race to dominate the field.\n\nLast week, OpenAI and Alphabet's Google showcased dueling AI technologies that can respond via voice in real time and be interrupted, both hallmarks of realistic voice conversations that AI voice assistants have found challenging. Google also announced it was rolling out several generative AI features to its lucrative search engine.\n\nWindows PC makers have been under increasing pressure from Apple since the company launched its custom chips based on designs from Arm and ditched Intel's processors. The Apple-designed processors have given Mac computers superior battery life and speedier performance than rivals' chips.\n\nMicrosoft tapped Qualcomm to lead the effort to move the Windows operating system to Arm's chip designs in 2016. Qualcomm has exclusivity on Microsoft Windows devices that expires this year. Other chip designers such as Nvidia have efforts under way to make their own Arm-based PC chips, Reuters has previously reported.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrabook", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultrabook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gartner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet_PCs", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet PCs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-110285910,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-38848,overlay-ettech/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 1005, "textEnd": 1012}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

New Surface devices and Copilot AI features are already center stage, including some features that could help Microsoft compete with Apple and OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft Build 2024 kicks off just a few weeks before Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference where it's expected to announce some major AI features. Google also just held its annual developer conference, Google I/O, which was all about its Gemini AI. So, it will be interesting to see how Microsoft's upcoming announcements compare, particularly when it comes to local, on-device AI.\n\nHere's a look at everything we know about Microsoft Build 2024 so far, what to expect, and how you can watch live.\n\n2024 has been the year of AI, so it's no surprise that Copilot will be the star of the show at Microsoft Build 2024. Microsoft kicked things off at a private preview event on May 20 where it announced Copilot+ PCs, a new collection of AI-powered laptops with local, on-device Copilot features.\n\nThe first round of Copilot+ PCs was announced at Monday's event, starting with a new Surface Pro and Surface Laptop. Both include a wealth of on-device AI features, such as Recall, the rumored \"AI Explorer\" feature that allows you to search your device and apps using natural language. It uses the Neural Processing Unit (NPU) on Copilot+ PCs to \"remember\" content you've viewed on your device. For example, you can ask Copilot to find a document you were working on if you forgot where you saved it.\n\nMicrosoft also unveiled Cocreator and Live Captions at the May 20 event. Cocreator is a generative AI tool that allows you to create AI-generated images right from your Copilot+ PC. Live Captions uses Copilot's natural language processing capabilities to create captions in real-time for virtually any content you want to watch or listen to. These tools are just the tip of the iceberg, too -- we could see even more new Copilot features unveiled at Microsoft Build this week.\n\nIn addition to the new suite of Copilot tools, we also expect to see Microsoft integrate Copilot into more apps. It already integrated Copilot into Windows 365 and rebranded its Bing Chat tool as Copilot earlier this year. The addition of dedicated Copilot keys on new Windows devices is also a clear indicator of Microsoft's commitment to on-device AI. So, it's a safe bet that Microsoft Build 2024 will include announcements of new Copilot integrations in Windows apps.\n\nMicrosoft's new AI features are closely tied to new hardware, including new Surface devices and laptops from ASUS, Dell, and Samsung. Microsoft unveiled updated versions of its Surface Laptop 6 and Surface Pro 10 in March, but those models were available only for business users. This week, we finally got the consumer versions and it looks like they were worth the wait.\n\nWhat's particularly exciting about these new Surface devices is the processor they're running: the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite. This highly-anticipated processor outpaced Apple's new M4 chip in benchmarks but hasn't hit the shelves in any consumer products yet. Now that's finally changing.\n\nMicrosoft isn't the only manufacturer unveiling its long-awaited Snapdragon X devices. A slew of other powerful new devices with Snapdragon X chips were also announced today, including:\n\nThese are just the first several Copilot+ PCs to be announced. There are likely many more to follow, such as the Samsung Galaxy Book 4 Edge, which is rumored to have a Snapdragon X Elite chip.\n\nOnce we get a chance to test these exciting new devices, we can finally see how the Snapdragon X processors compare to Apple's M3 and M4 chips in everyday use. Microsoft Build is just getting started, so we could see more new Copilot+ PCs unveiled in the days and weeks ahead.\n\nIf you're excited to see Microsoft's Copilot and Surface announcements at Microsoft Build, you can watch along for free with the official event livestream. You can register online to view the livestream on the Microsoft website or turn on notifications for the official Microsoft YouTube channel to watch there.\n\nThe big event to watch for is the keynote on May 21st, which will begin at 9 a.m. PST/12 p.m. EST. If you can't watch live, don't worry. We'll be covering all the highlights and announcements from Microsoft Build 2024, so stay tuned for more news, rumors, and product reveals.", "source": {"uri": "laptopmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LaptopMag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stevie_bonifield@laptopmag.com", "name": "Stevie Bonifield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Build", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Build"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surface Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural language processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edge (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Galaxy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gtGdUPbv5ZHdksqsvTUojL-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 91, "textEnd": 99, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 968, "textEnd": 974, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Other computer makers like Lenovo, Dell, HP, Asus, Acer and Samsung are also launching AI-ready PCs powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus processors, which promise longer battery life and will run Microsoft's Copilot AI chatbot.\n\nThe computers adhere to Microsoft's new Copilot+ standard that feature a minimum amount of performance, storage and memory. Copilot+ PCs with AMD and Intel chips will follow, Microsoft said during a press keynote on its campus in Redmond, Washington. The PCs will be able to translate audio, recommend responses to incoming messages and suggest changes in the Settings app, and even talk with people about what's on screen.\n\nCopilot+ PCs will start at $999. Microsoft is accepting pre-orders as of Monday, and the devices will become available in June.\n\nA Recall feature will be able to search through a log of previous actions on PCs. Recall relies on AI models that run directly on the device, so it can run offline, and an index of the data never goes to remote servers. AI models will be able to generate images based on written descriptions as well as drawings.\n\nMicrosoft is banking on Qualcomm's energy-efficient Arm-based chips that can handle AI models to defend its Windows franchise. Apple has gained market share in PC shipments with MacBooks containing its Arm-based chips, having moved away from Intel, the top provider of computer processors.\n\nMicrosoft is expanding its effort to surround consumers and business users with ChatGPT-like capabilities. OpenAI, backed by Microsoft, released the ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022, and it quickly took off as a tool for quickly obtaining computer-generated poems, email drafts and summaries of historical events.\n\nOther large technology companies, including Microsoft, soon started augmenting their products with generative AI. A Copilot chatbot drawing on ChatGPT's underlying AI models came to the Bing search engine, along with the Windows 10 and 11 operating systems. Those with Office productivity software subscriptions could pay extra to have a Copilot refer to their documents for written responses.\n\nThe GPT-4 model inside ChatGPT has only done its necessary computing work in Microsoft's Azure cloud. The new PCs can run some AI models locally without an internet connection. The launch comes nearly four months after Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts on the company's earnings call that \"in 2024, AI will become a first-class part of every PC.\"\n\nMicrosoft has had little success in getting people to adopt Arm-based Windows computers, which haven't always performed as well as PCs running Intel or AMD chips. Certain applications have been incompatible.\n\nRunning generative AI locally means computers will need more power, and strong battery life becomes more critical. That might make Windows on Arm more compelling.\n\nAnalysts with Morgan Stanley expect Arm systems to be 14% of all Windows PC shipments in 2026, up from 0% in 2023, according to a note distributed to clients earlier this month.", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Processor (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GPT-4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Stanley"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.nbcchicago.com/2024/05/107417246-1716214624819-gettyimages-2150291284-INDONESIA_MICROSOFT.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Check it out:\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella said that all of Microsoft's major laptop partners will have Copilot+ AI PCs, including Dell, Lenovo, Samsung, HP, Acer, and ASUS. Not only that, but Microsoft is also introducing two new Surface laptops that are ready for the world of AI.\n\nThe company announced the news during its Build conference, with Nadella reiterating that Microsoft is pushing big time into the world of Arm chips on Windows laptops, with Qualcomm's new Snapdragon X Elite SoC being the first Copilot+ AI PC in the wild. Intel and AMD-based CPUs and laptop designs will be coming out later this year.\n\nThe NPU (Neural Processing Unit) inside of the Copilot+ AI PCs will be able top run one of the flagship Copilot+ AI features called \"Recall\" which creates a searchable \"photographic memory\" of everything you've ever done, or seen on your AI PC. The new Copilot+ AI PCs will run over 40 AI models as part of Windows 11 to power the new features, with Microsoft's built-in AI assistant -- Copilot -- to receive support for OpenAI's new GPT-4o model.\n\nCopilot+ AI PCs will have specific system requirements: 16GB of RAM, 256GB of SSD storage, and an integrated NPU are all required to be an official Copilot+ AI PC. The hardware requirements are good, as I like to see 16GB of RAM as a bare minimum, 256GB SSD is small... but I guess the lower-end laptop SKUs can ship with at least 16GB RAM + 256GB SSD.\n\nThe new Copilot+ AI PC laptops will be \"58% faster\" than an Apple MacBook Air with an M3 processor, according to Yusuf Mehdi, the Microsoft executive overseeing Windows. Mehdi claimed \"all day\" battery life, but we all know to not trust the marketed battery life claims.\n\nThe first Copilot+ AI PCs will launch with Qualcomm processors on June 18, with Intel and AMD processors inside of designs to come later this year.

These computers, developed in collaboration with manufacturers like Acer and Asustek Computer, are designed to perform more artificial intelligence tasks without relying on cloud data centres. The new devices, starting at $1,000, will be available for purchase on June 18, the report added.\n\nNadella highlighted the innovative \"Recall\" feature of the Copilot PCs. \"Recall\" keeps track of all activities on the computer, from web browsing to voice chats, storing a searchable history that users can access to retrieve past actions. Microsoft also showcased the Copilot voice assistant acting as a real-time virtual coach for users playing the \"Minecraft\" video game, as quoted by Reuters.\n\nYusuf Mehdi, Microsoft's head of consumer marketing, projected that 50 million AI PCs would be sold over the next year. At the press event, Mehdi emphasized that faster AI assistants running directly on a PC would be \"the most compelling reason to upgrade your PC in a long time,\" as per Reuters.\n\nThe launch of these AI-powered PCs comes as Microsoft's shares trade near record highs, driven by Wall Street's optimism that AI will significantly boost profits for Microsoft and its Big Tech rivals. The global PC market, which saw shipments decline by about 15% to 242 million units last year according to Gartner, suggests that Microsoft anticipates its new Copilot PCs will account for approximately one-fifth of all PCs sold, the report added.\n\n\"People just need to be convinced that the device experience alone justifies this entirely new category of Copilot machines,\" said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies, as per the report.\n\nMicrosoft's introduction of the Copilot category recalls the \"Ultrabook\" campaign of 2011, where Intel promoted thin-form Windows laptops to compete against Apple's MacBook Air. Executives also announced that GPT-4o, the latest technology from OpenAI, will soon be integrated into Copilot.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft revealed a new generation of its Surface Pro tablet and Surface Laptop, equipped with Qualcomm chips based on Arm Holdings' architecture. A new technology called Prism was also introduced, enabling software designed for Intel and AMD chips to run on Arm-based chips.\n\nIn a demonstration, Microsoft showcased its new devices performing faster than an Apple device when running Adobe's photo editing software. This follows Apple's recent unveiling of an AI-focused chip expected to be used in future laptops.\n\nQualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chips, featuring a neural processing unit to accelerate AI applications like Copilot, are part of Microsoft's strategy to transition the Windows operating system to Arm's chip designs. Qualcomm's exclusivity on Microsoft Windows devices expires this year, opening the market to other chip designers such as Nvidia.\n\nMicrosoft's product event precedes its annual developer conference, underscoring its commitment to maintaining a lead in AI tool development. The company's partnership with OpenAI has positioned it ahead of Alphabet in the competitive AI landscape.\n\nRecently, OpenAI and Alphabet's Google showcased competing AI technologies capable of real-time voice interactions, a challenging milestone for AI voice assistants. Google also announced new generative AI features for its search engine.\n\nWindows PC makers face growing competition from Apple, which has gained an edge with custom chips based on Arm designs, offering Mac computers superior battery life and performance. Microsoft enlisted Qualcomm in 2016 to spearhead the shift to Arm's chip designs for Windows, a partnership that is now poised for broader collaboration with other chip designers.\n\nUnlock a world of Benefits!

Other chip designers such as Nvidia have efforts under way to make their own ARM-based PC chips. -- Reporting by Max A Cherney, with Yuvraj Malik Stephen Nellis, (c) 2024 Reuters", "source": {"uri": "techcentral.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechCentral"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ARM architecture family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrabook", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultrabook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gartner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet_PCs", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet PCs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://techcentral.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/microsoft-copilot-plus-pc-1500-i00.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 750, "textEnd": 757}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Along with updates to its Surface lineup, Microsoft also made some major announcements related to AI and a new era of PCs.\n\nMicrosoft didn't livestream this event, so if you want to catch up with everything it revealed, check out our roundup below.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed how Microsoft is \"bringing the AI wave to PCs,\" and that involves a new category of computers called Copilot Plus. These devices come with the Arm-based Snapdragon X Elite and Plus processors from Qualcomm and will later feature Intel and AMD chips.\n\nThe chips have neural processing units (NPUs) designed to power new AI features in Windows 11. As a result, Microsoft says Copilot Plus PCs are 58 percent faster than the M3 MacBook Air. In addition to Microsoft's new Surface devices, Lenovo, Dell, Acer, Asus, and HP are launching Copilot Plus devices designed to support new AI features.\n\nOne of the major AI features available within Copilot Plus PCs is Recall. The new tool runs locally on your device and logs everything you do on your computer, allowing you to search for and retrieve the content you've interacted with. That makes it possible to uncover a conversation you've had in apps like Discord, or even a specific PowerPoint slide you were working on.\n\nMicrosoft is bringing Copilot to more areas of Windows 11. The AI assistant will be able to provide suggestions within the Settings menu, edit files within File Explorer, or write responses to notifications you receive.\n\nCopilot is also getting OpenAI's new GPT-4o model, allowing the AI to answer questions based on what you see on your screen.\n\nMicrosoft's new Surface Pro -- sans model number -- swaps out the last-gen's Intel Core Ultra processor for Snapdragon X Elite and Plus chips from Qualcomm. It's up to 90 percent faster than the previous Surface Pro, and it comes with the option for an OLED display panel for the first time.\n\nThe 13-inch Surface Pro starts at $999.99 and is available in four colors, including blue, beige, black, and platinum. It's compatible with a new Surface Pro Flex Keyboard that works when attached or detached from the device.\n\nMicrosoft also announced the new Surface Laptop, which similarly offers the AI-ready Snapdragon X Elite and Plus chips. The device features a refreshed design with thinner bezels and a haptic touchpad. Microsoft says the device is more than 80 percent faster than its previous generation and offers up to 22 hours of local video playback.\n\nThe Surface Laptop 6 comes in 13.8- and 15-inch display options, starting at $999.99. It also comes in blue, beige, black, and platinum.\n\nMicrosoft is partnering with companies like Adobe to optimize their apps for Copilot Plus PCs. The native Arm64 versions of Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, Firefly, and Express will be available on Copilot Plus PCs today, while Illustrator and Premiere Pro will be available this summer. Copilot Plus PCs will also benefit from AI features within DaVinci Resolve, CapCut, Cephable, LiquidText, and djay Pro.", "source": {"uri": "theverge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Verge"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_roth@theverge.com", "name": "Emma Roth", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surface Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Explorer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "File Explorer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft PowerPoint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AArch64"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DaVinci_Resolve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DaVinci Resolve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haptic technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel Core"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchpad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Display device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r3gMBudS7_HcRNVK-8BJkqs8S6A=/0x0:1600x1063/1200x628/filters:focal(800x532:801x533)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25456746/lcimg_f444dba9_93ee_419b_910c_5f86662eb46b.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The first wave of \"Copilot+ PCs\" are coming this year.\n\nMicrosoft has announced a new category of computers, called Copilot+ PCs, starting with laptops using Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chipset. The main difference with Copilot+ PCs is that they meet the hardware requirements to run newer AI features in Windows, such as Recall, Live Captions with real-time translation, and more Windows Studio Effects. It's basically a label that says, \"this PC can do all the cool AI things.\"\n\nMicrosoft said in a blog post, \"Organizations can deploy Copilot+ PCs to get the fastest, most intelligent Windows PC ever built. Utilizing powerful new silicon with an NPU (neural processing unit) capable of an incredible 40+ TOPS (trillion operations per second), Copilot+ PCs provide organizations an exceptional AI endpoint for work, and a foundation for your chip-to-cloud solution stack. Copilot+ PCs unlock industry leading AI acceleration with up to 2x faster NPU performance than MacBook Air and MacBook Pro.\"\n\nCopilot already started invading Windows hardware earlier this year, when laptops started shipping with dedicated Copilot keys on the keyboard. Intel previously said that the Copilot key was one of the components required to meet Microsoft's definition of an \"AI PC,\" along with updated neural processing unit (NPU) and Copilot pre-installed. The new Copilot+ PCs seem to be a subset of that category.\n\nIntel and AMD don't have a laptop chip yet that meets the Copilot+ PC criteria -- that will presumably change later this year. In the meantime, we just have computers using the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chipset, which are expected to start shipping in June. Microsoft announced a new Surface Laptop and Surface Pro, and other manufacturers like Lenovo have announced laptops and 2-in-1 machines with Snapdragon chips.\n\nThe minimum hardware requirements for regular Windows 11 remain unchanged, and it's unclear right now if Windows 12 will bump up the baseline requirements. Previous rumors indicated there could be a Windows 12 release in 2024, but the AI shakeup might have changed those plans.\n\nSource: Windows Blog", "source": {"uri": "howtogeek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The How-To Geek"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chipset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solution stack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surface Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-in-1_PC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2-in-1 PC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer keyboard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/copilot.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

These new laptops will deliver next-gen AI capabilities and experiences thanks to more powerful processors and Neural Processing Units, aka NPUs, which are specifically designed for tasks related to AI workload.\n\nIt also means that these new AI features will be exclusive to Copilot+ PCs. These features will not come to existing Windows PCs and laptops. Here is everything you need to know about Microsoft's new wave of Copilot+ PCs.\n\nMicrosoft has described Copilot+ PCs as \"the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever built.\" These PCs will have a new system architecture featuring powerful CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs. They will be required to have at least 16GB of RAM, 256GB SSD storage, and an integrated NPU. The NPU used in these PCs will be able to perform over 40 trillion operations per second, i.e., the power of 40 TOPS.\n\nThe company is further claiming \"all-day battery life\" with Copilot+ PCs. As the new branding suggests, these laptops will be loaded with next-gen Copilot AI experience that you cannot get on a normal Windows PC. Users will get access to the latest models, which is GPT-4o for now.\n\nMicrosoft is working closely with Qualcomm, AMD, Intel, and other OEMs to bring Copilot+ PCs to the market. Qualcomm's all-new Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus are the first processors to launch on a Copilot+ PC.\n\nRecall is the biggest Copilot+ PC feature announced by Microsoft yet. It is meant to help users locate anything on the PC, including the stuff you cannot remember. You can look for it on the PC via next-gen Copilit AI experience using whatever clues you can remember.\n\nThe search can be done in natural language, like using a query like \"chart with purple writing.\" Recall also offers a timeline of all the things you did on your PC, which you can scroll to find what you are looking for.\n\nRecall works by taking snapshots of your PC activities and storing them for future reference. Microsoft says these snapshots are stored locally on the device, and the user is in complete control. They can delete any snapshot whenever they want, exclude apps/websites, and pause the feature anytime right from the System Tray on the Windows taskbar.\n\nCocreate will let Copilot+ PC users generate images by combining ink strokes and text prompts. Microsoft says it will work in almost real-time and make you feel like you are creating alongside AI. There is a Creativity slider that will let users choose whether the final artwork should be \"more literal\" or more expressive\".\n\nCopilot+ PCs are said to allow users to generate images without any limitations for free and at faster speeds. They will also be able to save generated images to collections.\n\nCopilot+ PCs will offer Live Captions support with live translation. It will be capable of translating any audio passing through the PC into the English language. The feature is claimed to work in real-time and across all apps consistently. It will support live and pre-recorded audio in any app or video platform in more than 40 languages. The best part is live translation is said to work even when offline.\n\nWindows Studio Effects will help you present your best during online meetings. The Portrait Light feature ensures that your face is well-lit and looks good even when you are attending meetings in a low-lit environment. There are also new creative filters, an eye contact teleprompter, and improvements to portrait blur and voice focus.\n\nMicrosoft announced that new Copilot+ PCs will start at USD 999 (about Rs 83,245) and become available on June 18, 2024. These will come from different brands, including big names like Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung, and Microsoft Surface.", "source": {"uri": "mysmartprice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MySmartPrice.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ajit_singh@mysmartprice.com", "name": "Ajit Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solid-state drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Original equipment manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Surface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taskbar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taskbar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://assets.mspimages.in/gear/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Windows-Copilot-PC.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-06-", "textStart": 3653, "textEnd": 3660}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

The company introduced Copilot+ PCs, designed to run generative AI locally, and showcased new AI features in Windows 11. Here's a rundown of everything that Microsoft announced at its Surface event.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella announced the launch of Copilot Plus PCs, a new category of computers featuring Qualcomm's Arm-based Snapdragon X Elite and Plus processors.These PCs come equipped with neural processing units (NPUs) to power AI features in Windows 11, making them 58 percent faster than the M3 MacBook Air. The company says that Copilot+ PCs are the \"fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever built.\"\n\nIn addition to Microsoft's new Surface devices, major PC manufacturers such as Lenovo, Dell, Acer, Asus, and HP are launching Copilot Plus devices to support the new AI features.\n\nMicrosoft is expanding Copilot's presence in Windows 11, enabling the AI assistant to provide suggestions in the Settings menu, edit files in File Explorer, and write responses to notifications. Copilot is also getting OpenAI's new GPT-4o model, allowing it to answer questions based on what you see on your screen.\n\nOne of the key AI features in Copilot Plus PCs is Recall, a tool that logs everything you do on your computer, allowing you to search for and retrieve content you've interacted with. This makes it possible to uncover conversations in apps like Discord or specific slides you were working on in PowerPoint.\n\nThe new Surface Pro, now powered by Snapdragon X Elite and Plus chips, is up to 90 percent faster than its predecessor. For the first time, it offers an OLED display panel option. The 13-inch Surface Pro starts at $999.99 and comes in four colours, compatible with a new Surface Pro Flex Keyboard that works both attached and detached from the device.\n\nMicrosoft also introduced the new Surface Laptop, featuring the same AI-ready Snapdragon X Elite and Plus chips. With a refreshed design, thinner bezels, and a haptic touchpad, the laptop is more than 80 percent faster than its previous generation and about 58 percent faster than the M3-powered MacBook Air. It boasts up to 22 hours of local video playback (again, more than what Apple promises for the MacBook Air). The Surface Laptop 6 comes in 13.8- and 15-inch display options, starting at $999.99.\n\nMicrosoft is partnering with companies like Adobe to optimize their apps for Copilot Plus PCs. Native Arm64 versions of Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, Firefly, and Express will be available on Copilot Plus PCs today, with Illustrator and Premiere Pro coming this summer. Other apps such as DaVinci Resolve, CapCut, Cephable, LiquidText, and Djay Pro will also benefit from AI features on Copilot Plus PCs.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abhinav_kaustubh@timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "name": "Abhinav Kaustubh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surface Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Explorer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "File Explorer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AArch64"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DaVinci_Resolve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DaVinci Resolve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haptic technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchpad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft PowerPoint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Display device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer keyboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110299800,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-46544,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

The company also demonstrated its Copilot voice assistant acting as a real-time virtual coach to a user playing the \"Minecraft\" video game.\n\nYusuf Mehdi, who heads up consumer marketing for Microsoft, said the company expects that 50 million AI PCs will be purchased over the next year. At the press event, he said faster AI assistants that run directly on a PC will be \"the most compelling reason to upgrade your PC in a long time.\"\n\nGlobal PC shipments dipped about 15% to 242 million last year, according to research firm Gartner, which suggests Microsoft expects the new category of computers to account for around one-fifth of all PCs sold.\n\n\"People just need to be convinced that the device experience alone justifies this entirely new category of Copilot+ machines,\" said analyst Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies.\n\nMicrosoft's new \"Copilot+\" computer marketing category that highlights AI features is reminiscent of the \"Ultrabook\" category of thin-form Windows laptops that Intel promoted with PC manufacturers in 2011 to compete against Apple's MacBook Air.\n\nMicrosoft executives also said that GPT-4o, the latest technology from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, will \"soon\" be available as part of Microsoft Copilot.\n\nMicrosoft also introduced a new generation of its own Surface Pro tablet and Surface Laptop that feature Qualcomm chips based on Arm Holdings' architecture. The company also introduced a technology called Prism that will help software written for Intel and AMD chips run on chips made with Arm technology.\n\nMicrosoft showed its new devices in action against an Apple device, showing photo editing software from Adobe running faster on the Microsoft device. Apple earlier this month showed a new AI-focused chip that analysts expect to be used in future laptops.\n\nAfter Intel's processors dominated the PC market for decades, Qualcomm and other makers of lower-power Arm components have tried to compete in the Windows-PC market.\n\nThe Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chips include a so-called neural processing unit that is designed to accelerate AI-focused applications, such as Microsoft's Copilot software.\n\nMicrosoft held the product event a day before the start of its annual developer conference.\n\nMicrosoft aims to extend its early advantage in the race to produce AI tools that consumers are willing to pay for. Its partnership with OpenAI allowed it to jump ahead of Alphabet as other Big Tech companies race to dominate the emerging field.\n\nLast week, OpenAI and Alphabet's Google showcased dueling AI technologies that can respond via voice in real time and be interrupted, both hallmarks of realistic voice conversations that AI voice assistants have found challenging. Google also announced it was rolling out several generative AI features to its lucrative search engine.\n\nThe PC industry has been under increasing pressure from Apple since the company launched its custom chips based on designs from Arm and ditched Intel's processors. The Apple-designed processors have given Mac computers superior battery life and speedier performance than rivals' chips that use more energy.\n\nMicrosoft tapped Qualcomm to lead the effort to move the Windows operating system to Arm's chip designs in 2016. Qualcomm has exclusivity on Microsoft Windows devices that expires this year. Other chip designers such as Nvidia have efforts under way to make their own Arm-based PC chips, Reuters has previously reported.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arm (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrabook", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultrabook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gartner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/microsoft-ai-satya-nadella.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1716217986&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 774, "textEnd": 781}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Microsoft also revamped the laptop's design, making it more modern, slimming the bezels and adding an AI-enhanced camera and haptic touchpad.\n\nAs for the Surface Pro, it has a new OLED with HDR display option, ultrawide camera, and a new Surface Pro Flex keyboard.\n\nThe company said its new Surfaces are up to 80 percent faster than their predecessors while also boasting the longest battery life on any Surface PC. It's also more efficient, achieving the same peak performance while draining half as much battery. Microsoft says the new Surfaces double the battery life of previous Surfaces.\n\nMicrosoft also announced 'Copilot + PC,' new branding to highlight AI-capable PCs. Microsoft said this new category of PCs are totally revamped, offering super thin designs while still being the \"most powerful PCs in the world.\" The performance relies on a new architecture that combines CPU, GPU and Neural Processing Unit (NPU), which can achieve over 40 trillion operations per second.\n\nThe company said Copilot + PCs sport significant improvements thanks to a huge leap in compute performance. Microsoft is working closely with Intel, AMD and Qualcomm to achieve higher performance. Microsoft claimed that Copilot + PCs running on Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chip are significantly faster than Apple's M3 chip, including up to 58 percent better sustained multithreaded performance. There's also Prism, a new ARM translation layer for Windows.\n\nMicrosoft detailed some improvements coming to Copilot as well, such as turning it into a more app-like experience that can be resized and repositioned. Additionally, Windows users will be able to drag and drop between other apps and Copilot. OpenAI's GPT-4o will also make its way into Copilot. Microsoft showed a demo of someone playing Minecraft while Copilot speaks to them and teaches them how to play the game.\n\nLater, Microsoft detailed Copilot Vision to help gamers in-game by allowing them to ask questions. For example, while flying in Microsoft Flight Simulator, gamers could summon Copilot to ask where the nearest airport is so they can land their plane.\n\nAnother feature Microsoft highlighted was 'Recall,' which leverages AI and the improved system performance to help people find things they were doing on their PC. Recall will only be available on the Copilot + PC devices. Recall can help people find documents, websites, conversations and more, and can even work based on little details, such as mentioning that the document had purple writing.\n\nMicrosoft says Recall will stay on-device and the company won't use any of the data for AI training. Recall leverages several small models that are built into Windows, allowing the AI to work efficiently in Windows and across all apps.

Despite having a name similar to that of the Copilot AI assistant, Copilot+ is very different and encompasses several different things rather than one specific service.\n\nSo, just what is Copilot+? Does it cost money to use? What features does Copilot+ have? How is Copilot+ different from plain old Copilot? And when does it come out? We'll discuss all that and more.\n\nMicrosoft specifically says that \"Copilot+ PCs are optimized to run AI workloads locally with better performance, featuring 8 high performance cores and 4 efficiency optimized cores in the built-in CPU within the X Elite.\"\n\nAdditional Copilot+ AI features on AI PCs allow you to:\n\nIn an interview with Wall Street Journal (which you can watch embedded above), Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella talks Copilot+ PCs and discusses how they not only \"beat Apple's Macs\" but also bring real competition back to the Windows versus Mac discussion.\n\nSo what exactly is Copilot+ PC performance like? According to Microsoft, these AI PCs' AI-boosting NPUs (Neural Processing Units), make these laptops very fast and efficient. For instance, Microsoft says its new AI PC Surface laptops and other Windows AI PCs with Copilot+ are 58% faster than Apple's MacBook Air M3.\n\nHere are some AI PC laptops that come with Copilot+ (in alphabetical order):\n\nOver the last few years, different tech companies have been vying for control over the AI market. Now that Microsoft has announced Copilot+, it is once more solidifying its role as an AI machine learning leader. Integrating next-gen AI features locally throughout the AI PC experience is definitely one way to stay relevant.\n\nI know I'm excited to see what kind of additional edits this allows me to make in Adobe Photoshop or Premiere Pro.

Users will also be able to share your screen with Copilot and have a natural conversation with the app.\n\n\"The richest AI experiences will harness the power of the cloud and the edge working together in concert this in turn will lead to a new category of devices that turn the world itself into a prompt,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said during the company's Build event on Monday. \"For us, this vision starts with our most beloved and most widely used canvas: Windows.\"\n\nMicrosoft's new PC push comes as the PC market enters the early innings of a turnaround after two years of declines. According to IDC, PC shipments grew 1.5% in the first quarter, compared to a 28.7% decline during the same time in 2023.\n\nYusuf Mehdi, Microsoft EVP and consumer chief marketing officer, said the company expects over 50 million AI PCs will be purchased over the next year.\n\nCopilot+PCs are an offshoot of AI PCs, which are generally defined as PCs running on Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM) chips with built-in neural processing units, or neural engines, that can run generative AI applications locally without needing to connect to the internet.\n\nCopilot+ PCs will include 16GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage to ensure performance.\n\nIn a pre-recorded demonstration of Copilot's GPT-4o integration, a user fired up the game Minecraft and asked Copilot how to craft a sword. The assistant could see what the user was doing in the game and walk him through everything he needed to do to build the item.\n\nMicrosoft says it will integrate Copilot for a number of gaming apps, and because it will run on your PC's NPU rather than its GPU, it shouldn't hurt overall performance.\n\nMicrosoft also touted the performance of its Copilot+ PCs and hammered home what it sees as a performance advantage over similar Apple (AAPL) devices.\n\nAccording to the company, a laptop running one of Qualcomm's Arm-based Snapdragon X Elite chips will provide 20% more battery life than Apple's MacBook Air, 23% better peak performance, and 58% better sustained multithread performance. The company also demonstrated Adobe's Photoshop running on its Surface laptop and beating Apple's MacBook Air with M3 chips in certain tasks.\n\nIn addition to rolling out Copilot+PC versions of its Surface Laptop and Surface Pro devices, Microsoft said this software will be featured in Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung products.\n\nMicrosoft's announcements come just a few weeks before rival Apple (AAPL) is expected to debut its own AI features across its product lines, including the iPhone and Mac, at its WWDC developer event on June 10.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Doing so requires a chipset with a neural processing unit (NPU), and manufacturers such as Qualcommm have been laying the groundwork with chips like the Snapdragon X Elite.\n\nMicrosoft is taking a partner-first approach to making Copilot+ PCs. Along with chipmakers like AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm, major OEMs including Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP and Lenovo are on board. The first Copilot+ laptops are available to preorder today and they'll ship on June 18.\n\nMicrosoft posted on its Official Microsoft Blog: Today, at a special event on our new Microsoft campus, we introduced the world to a new category of Windows PCs designed for AI, Copilot+ PCs.\n\nCopilot+ PCs are the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever built. With powerful new silicon capable of an incredible 40+ TOPS (trillion operations per second), all-day battery life and access to the most advanced AI models, Copilot+ PCs will enable you to do things you can't really do on any other PC.\n\nEasily find and remember what you have seen in your PC with Recall, generate and refine AI images in near real-time directly on the device using Cocreator, and bridge language barriers with Live Captions, translating audio from 40+ languages into English.\n\nThese experiences come to life on a set of thin, light and beautiful devices from Microsoft Surface and our OEM partners Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung, with pre-orders beginning today and availability starting on June 18. Starting at $999, Copilot+ PCs offer incredible value.\n\nArsTechnica reported Microsoft is using its new Surface launch and this week's Build developer conference as a platform to launch its new \"Copilot+\" PCs initiative, which comes with specific hardware requirements that systems will need to meet to be eligible.\n\nCopilot+ PCs will be able to handle some AI-accelerated workloads like chatbots and image generation locally instead of relying on the cloud, but new hardware will generally be required to run these workloads quickly and power efficiently,\n\nAt a minimum, systems will need 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, to accommodate both the memory requirements and the on-disk storage requirements needed for things like large language models (LLMs; even so-called \"small language models\" like Microsofts Phi-3, still use several billion parameters).\n\nBut the biggest new requirement, and the blocker for virtually ever Window's PC in use today, will be for an integrated rural processing unit, or NPU. Microsoft requires an NPU with performance rated at 40 trillion operations per second (TOPS), a high-level performance figure that Microsoft, Qualcomm, Apple and others use for NPU performance comparisons.\n\nRight now, that requirement can only be met by a single chip in the Windows PC ecosystem, one that isn't even quite available yet.\n\nIn my opinion, some people will be very excited about the AI that has been \"baked in\" to Microsoft's Copilot+ PC.

The tech corporation said that Copilot + PCs are the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever built. Copilot + PC means that your PC is now AI (artificial intelligence) enabled, and will come with many AI features that other PCs do not. Microsoft announced several new features, all of which we are going to talk about here and now. Let's get started.\n\nMicrosoft said that Copilot + PC can achieve a level of performance never seen before, as it is \"connected to and enhanced by the large language models (LLMs) running in our Azure Cloud in concert with small language models (SLMs).\"\n\nOne of the biggest claims made by Microsoft during the event is that Copilot + PC laptops outperform Apple's MacBook Air 15-inch by up to 58% in sustained multithread performance. We won't dive in too much about what Copilot + PCs will perform like. We will talk about the AI features that they can enable.\n\nRead More - Apple Brings New 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro with M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max Chips\n\nAn AI feature that is very interesting and sound certainly helpful is 'Recall' from Microsoft. It often happens that we see something somewhere on our PC, whether it is a website, or a folder, and then we forget where it was.\n\n\"Now with Recall, you can access virtually what you have seen or done on your PC in a way that feels like having photographic memory. Copilot+ PCs organize information like we do - based on relationships and associations unique to each of our individual experiences,\" said Microsoft.\n\nBasically, everything you do, is stored in the form of continous screenshots, that you can access later to remember stuff. Note that Microsoft doesn't store this data in the cloud, it will stay locally in your PC to keep your privacy safe.\n\nWith Copilot + PC, applications like Paint and Photos will get AI features that will enable you to generate photos via brush strokes and texts.\n\nMicrosoft said, \"Take photo editing and image creation to the next level. With Restyle Image, you can reimagine your personal photos with a new style combining image generation and photo editing in Photos. Use a pre-set style like Cyberpunk or Claymation to change the background, foreground or full picture to create an entirely new image.\"\n\nRead More - ASUS ROG Flow X13 (2023) GV302 Review: Power with Functionality\n\nCopilot + PC will also bring AI for all the applications you love to work on. You will see deep integration of Adobe apps with Copilot + PC. Apps such as Photoshop, Lightroom, and Express are available, while Illustrator, Premiere Pro and more are coming this summer.\n\nDaVinci Resolve will also be included. Microsoft said, \"Effortlessly apply visual effects to objects and people using NPU-accelerated Magic Mask in DaVinci Resolve Studio.\"\n\nFor CapCut, Microsoft added, \"Remove the background from any video clip in a snap using Auto Cutout running on the NPU in CapCut. \"\n\nMicrosoft said that users can play games on their PCs with just the movement of their heads with Cephable, that will be available for Copilot + PCs.\n\nWith LiquidText on Copilot + PCs, Microsoft said that users will be able to make smarter annotations to documents, using AI features that run entirely on-device via NPU. Thus your text data remains private to you only.\n\nRemixing tracks with the help of AI on Copilot + PCs is now possible. djay Pro is optimised to work with Windows AI and will give users the ability to mix tracks with a new and higher quality version of NeuralMix.\n\nWhether you are watching something pre-recorded or live, you can take help of the Live Captions to understand what is being said. Live Captions will translate the audio in real time across all of your apps consistently. There is support for over 40 languages at the moment.\n\nWith Windows Studio Effects, you will look and sound your best always. There's Portrait Light that will automatically adjust the image to improve your percieved illumination in a dark environment or brighten the foreground pixels when in a low-light environment. There are also new improvements to voice focus and portrait blur helps ensure you're always in focus.\n\nOf course, there's Copilot, which is a powerful AI agent, that is just a single tap away on keyboards with the new Copilot key. Copilot now has a full application experience for customers.\n\nMicrosoft said, \"Copilot puts the most advanced AI models at your fingertips. In the coming weeks, get access to the latest models including GPT-4o from our partners at OpenAI, so you can have voice conversations that feel more natural.\"\n\nThis is everything you get in the features department. Of course, the Snapdragon X Elite chip inside the Copilot + PCs will help in delivering great power as well as high battery efficiency, which will give strong competition to the existing MacBook Air powered by M3 chip.", "source": {"uri": "telecomtalk.info", "dataType": "news", "title": "TelecomTalk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tanay_singh_thakur@telecomtalk.info", "name": "Tanay Singh Thakur", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_editing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Image editing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DaVinci_Resolve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DaVinci Resolve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyberpunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Illustrator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Illustrator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Premiere_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Premiere Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenshot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Screenshot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://telecomtalk.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/microsoft-announces-copilot-pcs-get-every-detail-1-1024x683.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-", "textStart": 164, "textEnd": 170}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Other computer makers like Lenovo, Dell, HP, Asus, Acer and Samsung are also launching AI-ready PCs powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus processors, which promise longer battery life and will run Microsoft's Copilot AI chatbot.\n\nThe computers adhere to Microsoft's new Copilot+ standard that feature a minimum amount of performance, storage and memory. Copilot+ PCs with AMD and Intel chips will follow, Microsoft said during a press keynote on its campus in Redmond, Washington. The PCs will be able to translate audio, recommend responses to incoming messages and suggest changes in the Settings app and even talk with people about what's on screen.\n\nA Recall feature will be able to search through a log of previous actions on PCs. Recall relies on AI models that run directly on the device, so it can run offline, and an index of the data never goes to remote servers. And AI models will be able to generate images based on written descriptions as well as drawings.\n\nMicrosoft is banking on Qualcomm's energy-efficient Arm-based chips that can handle AI models to defend its Windows franchise. Apple has gained market share in PC shipments with MacBooks containing its Arm-based chips, having moved away from Intel, which remains the top provider of computer processors.\n\nThe development marks Microsoft's latest effort to surround consumers and corporate workers with ChatGPT-like capabilities. OpenAI released the ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022, and it quickly took off as a tool for quickly obtaining computer-generated poems, email drafts and summaries of historical events. Within nearly two months, 100 million people were using it.\n\nMicrosoft and other large technology companies were soon working to augment their products with generative AI. A Copilot chatbot drawing on ChatGPT's underlying AI models came to the Bing search engine, along with the Windows 10 and 11 operating systems. Those with Office productivity software subscriptions could pay extra to have a Copilot refer to their documents for written responses.\n\nBut the GPT-4 model inside ChatGPT has only done its necessary computing work in Microsoft's Azure cloud. These new PCs models can run AI some models locally, without requiring an internet connection. The launch comes nearly four months after Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts on the company's earnings call that \"in 2024, AI will become a first-class part of every PC.\"\n\nMicrosoft has had little success in getting people to adopt Arm-based Windows computers. They haven't always performed as well as computers running Intel or AMD chips, and certain applications have been incompatible. But running generative AI locally means computers will need more power, and strong battery life will be more critical. That might make Windows on Arm more compelling.\n\nAnalysts with Morgan Stanley expect Arm systems to be 14% of all Windows PC shipments in 2026, up from 0% in 2023, according to a note distributed to clients earlier this month.", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordan_novet@cnbc.com", "name": "Jordan Novet", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Copilot+ is the next stage of the AI PC, capable of more advanced AI functions that Microsoft is building into the next version of Windows 11.\n\nFor a PC to be a Copilot+ PC, it must include an NPU capable of at least 45 TOPS of power. Qualcomm's new Snapdragon X Series chips are the first Windows PC chips on the market to reach this benchmark, which means the first wave of Copilot+ PCs will be exclusively powered by Windows on Arm. Copilot+ PCs with Intel and AMD chips are expected to follow later this year.\n\nMicrosoft is touting a handful of new AI experiences that are only possible on Copilot+ PCs:\n\nThe next-gen AI experiences coming to Windows 11 are nothing short of impressive. The most notable new feature is Recall, which runs in the background and remembers everything you see and do on your computer, enabling the ability to search for anything you've done on your PC using natural language, and it works across any app.\n\nMicrosoft describes it as a truly powerful productivity tool, and is an example of how AI is able to work in the background to improve your workflow. Ideally, the days of not being able to find a conversation, web page, document, image, or video are in the past, as you can just Recall it by simply asking.\n\nThe Recall feature includes a built-in Timeline interface that lets users scroll back through different snapshots that Windows has captured based on your search criteria. For example, if you search for \"dinosaurs,\" every instance where content about dinosaurs was on your screen will appear along the timeline for you to jump to.\n\nRecall can also understand what's currently on your screen, and provide helpful contextual suggestions depending on what it can see. You could be looking at an image on a webpage, and the Recall interface will show prompts to help you edit that photo with a single click. It could also help compare two documents or articles that you have open side by side.\n\nMicrosoft is also highlighting improvements to Live Captions, which on Copilot+ PCs is capable of translating 40+ different languages into English from any live or pre-recorded audio and video, directly on the device without reaching out to the cloud. Windows Studio Effects are also more advanced, with the ability to virtually improve lighting conditions or apply real-time artistic styles to your webcam video feed.\n\nLastly, Microsoft is highlighting improved generative AI functionality that's coming to Copilot and Cocreator. Copilot+ devices will be able to generate images and text without reaching out to the cloud, which should result in a much faster Copilot experience for certain tasks.\n\nMicrosoft is describing Copilot+ PCs as the beginning of a new era for Windows devices, and it's betting on these new AI features being impressive enough for end-users to want to upgrade from their existing PCs.\n\nIf you're eager to get your hands on some of the first Copilot+ PCs, you won't have to wait long. Microsoft says the first Copilot+ PCs will begin shipping next month, sometime in June. Many of these next-gen AI experiences won't be available right away, however, as those are expected to launch later this year.\n\nThe first devices launching under the Copilot+ moniker are Microsoft's own Surface Pro and Surface Laptop devices, which both feature Snapdragon X chips among other improvements. Surface isn't the only Copilot+ PCs launching this June, however.

Now, PC users will get to hear more about how AI will be embedded in Windows and what they can do with it on new AI PCs.\n\nBuild comes days after Google I/O, where the search giant unveiled its most powerful AI model yet and showed how its Gemini AI will work on computers and phones. Prior to Google's event, OpenAI announced its new GPT-4o model. Microsoft is OpenAI's lead investor, and its Copilot technology is based on OpenAI's models..\n\nFor Microsoft, the challenge is twofold: keeping a prominent position in AI and bolstering PC sales, which have been in the doldrums for the past two years following an upgrade cycle during the pandemic.\n\nIn a recent note on Dell to investors, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote that he remains \"bullish on the PC market recovery\" due to commentary from customers and recent \"upward revisions to notebook\" original design manufacturer (ODM) builds.\n\nTechnology industry researcher Gartner estimated that PC shipments increased 0.9% in the quarter after a multi-year slump. Demand for PCs was \"slightly better than expected,\" Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said on the company's quarterly earnings call last month.\n\nNew AI tools from Microsoft could offer another reason for enterprise and consumer customers to upgrade their aging computers, whether they're made by HP, Dell or Lenovo.\n\n\"While Copilot for Windows does not directly drive monetization it should, we believe, drive up usage of Windows, stickiness of Windows, customers to higher priced more powerful PCs (and therefore more revenue to Microsoft per device), and likely search revenue,\" Bernstein analysts wrote in a note to investors on April 26, the day after Microsoft reported earnings.\n\nWhile Microsoft will provide the software to handle some of the AI tasks sent to the internet, its computers will be powered by chips from AMD, Intel and Qualcomm for offline AI jobs. That could include, for example, using your voice to ask Copilot to summarize a transcription without a connection.\n\nThe key hardware addition to an AI PC is what's called a neural processing unit. NPUs go beyond the capabilities of traditional central processing units (CPUs) and are designed to specifically handle artificial intelligence tasks. Traditionally, they've been used by companies like Apple to improve photos and videos or for speech recognition.\n\nMicrosoft hasn't said what AI PCs will be capable of yet without an internet connection. But Google's PIxel 8 Pro phone, which doesn't have a full computer processor, can summarize and transcribe recordings, recommend text message responses and more using its Gemini Nano AI.\n\nComputers with Intel's latest Lunar Lake chips with a dedicated NPU are expected to arrive in late 2024. Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chip with an NPU will be available in the middle of this year, while AMD's latest Ryzen Pro is expected sometime during the quarter.\n\nIntel says the chips allow for things like \"real-time language translation, automation inferencing, and enhanced gaming environments.\"\n\nApple has been using NPUs for years and recently highlighted them in its new M4 chip for the iPad Pro. The M4 chip is expected to launch in the next round of Macs sometime this year.\n\nQualcomm, unlike Intel and AMD, offers chips powered by Arm-based architecture. One of Microsoft's sessions will talk about \"the Next Generation of Windows on Arm,\" which will likely cover how Windows runs on Qualcomm chips and how that's different from Intel and AMD versions of Windows.\n\nIntel still controls 78% of the PC chip market, followed by AMD at 13%, according to recent data from Canalys.\n\nIn the past, Qualcomm has promoted Snapdragon Arm-based computers by touting their longer battery life, thinner designs and other benefits like cellular connections. But earlier versions of Qualcomm's chips were limited in what they offered consumers. In 2018, for example, the company's Snapdragon 835 chip couldn't run most Windows applications.\n\nMicrosoft has since improved Windows to handle traditional apps on Arm, but questions remain. The company even has an FAQ page dedicated to computers running on ARM hardware.\n\nMicrosoft will also be hosting sessions like \"AI Everywhere\" covering how to \"accelerate generative AI models\" on devices that run in the cloud.\n\nAn \"Azure AI Studio\" session will look at how developers can create their own Copilot chatbots, which may be similar to what Google and OpenAI are doing with Gemini and ChatGPT.

The company is hoping for brands like Asus, HP and Dell among others to sign up for these PCs that analysts expect will help the PC segment grow to new heights in the next few years.\n\nMicrosoft has managed to get Qualcomm, Intel and AMD as well on board to make chips that will power the Copilot+ PCs in the next few years. It is imperative that PCs that will power the supposed AI features focus on power management as well, which is essential to run these apps that can be power-hungry, so the machine needs to manage the load to justify its running on the device.\n\nThe AI PC era will also show us if Microsoft can finally catch up with Apple's M-series silicone or even better it with more resourceful products. Some of the comparisons with the Apple M3 MacBook Air already seem to be pointing towards a solid upgrade but paper talk needs to convert into real-time performance upgrades.\n\nHaving 16GB RAM on board seems like the minimum now for the Windows 11 PCs but that also means you spend a lot more to buy/upgrade to these AI PCs.\n\nAs you might know, Microsoft partnered with OpenAI which helped with the development of Copilot. The AI assistant running on Windows 11 PCs is ChatGPT with Microsoft's interface layer. The Copilot + PCs take this integration deeper, including a new feature called Recall. Microsoft says the tool will help people find items, files and even their search activity on the PC itself.\n\nThe company wants you to trust these AI PCs with every task so that one day, these AI assistants can guide you with the next step towards a project or command. It also pointed out that Recall has a photographic memory of your virtual activity on the Windows PC.\n\nBut tracking at this level could leave you prone to possible misuse given the power the AI assistant has been offered. Microsoft says all the data processing is done on the device thanks to the AI processor that also has a neural engine. Users will be given the choice of stopping their activity from being tracked as well.\n\nMicrosoft and the entire PC industry is placing all its bets on the AI PCs but they quickly need apps to justify or at least show us the potential of the hardware that is slowly making its way into the market.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/05/microsoft-copilot-pcs-2024-2024-05-2816fe59179f807bcd6b01f66b817ef6-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Alongside the hardware are important new software capabilities, all of which center on Microsoft's Copilot AI offerings. The technology is intended to finally make running Windows 11 on Arm palatable and desirable in terms of speed, compatibility, and support for on-device AI processing. Here's everything Microsoft showed off today.\n\nIn March, Microsoft unveiled the Surface Pro 10 for Business and Surface Laptop 6 for Business, and today we got consumer versions of Microsoft's hardware.\n\nThe Surface Pro runs the Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus processors. It comes with a 13.8- or 15-inch display and there's an optional OLED with HDR technology option on the 13-inch. It has two USB 4 ports, Wi-Fi 7 support, and optional 5G support. A new Surface Pro Flex Keyboard is the first 2-in-1 keyboard designed to be used both attached or detached, Microsoft says.\n\nMicrosoft says the Surface Laptop is 86% faster than Laptop 5 and promises the \"longest battery life on any Surface\" -- up to 22 hours on the 15-inch Surface Laptop and 20 hours on the 13.8-inch. This one also supports Wi-Fi 7.\n\nThe new Surfaces start at $999 and launch on June 18. Stay tuned for our hands ons.\n\nPrism is analogous to Apple's Rosetta 2 transcoding software that enables non-Arm software to run well on the newer Apple Silicon CPUs. Basing a PC on Arm makes for far better battery life, cheaper production, and smaller chips. If Microsoft's Prism can reach the performance level that Rosetta delivers, it will finally be realistic to expect large-scale adoption of Windows PCs using Arm processors. As with Rosetta 2, applications that take advantage of Prism won't require any special optimization to run on Arm-based PCs.\n\nAt today's event, Microsoft rattled off a list of big software titles that have been updated to run natively on Windows systems powered by Arm chips, which should deliver better performance than apps using Prism. They include Microsoft's own Teams, PowerPoint, Outlook, Word, Excel, OneDrive, and OneNote.\n\nBut big third-party software houses have jumped on board as well, with Chrome, Spotify, Zoom, WhatsApp, Blender, Affinity Suite, and DaVinci Resolve now all getting native Arm versions for Windows. In particular, the Adobe apps (with Firefly) and DaVinci Resolve make extensive use of AI for media editing, so the ability to run these faster on Arm will be welcome.\n\nWith Windows 11, Microsoft abandoned Windows 10's Timeline feature, which allowed you to easily review and return to previously used apps. The new Recall feature for Copilot+ PCs is an AI-charged reincarnation of Timeline and lets users perform intuitive searches through their files, internet history, and more.\n\nRecall uses a semantic index with a timeline, so it can understand content and context in time. According to Microsoft, its results are based on \"relationships and associations unique to each of our individual experiences.\" That could pop up privacy red flags for some users, but Microsoft states that a user's personal index is stored entirely on the local device.\n\nCopilot can already generate images using Microsoft Designer (powered by Dall-E 3), but that's done on Microsoft's servers. With the new Microsoft Paint Cocreator features, Copilot+ PCs will be able to handle these functions locally, meaning less waiting and better privacy.\n\nThe Microsoft Photos app included with Windows 11 now has some generative AI features of its own, including the ability to blur or remove the background in a photo.\n\nCopilot+ PCs will add the ability to change the style of a photo with options like \"Cyberpunk or Claymation\" and you'll be able to generate images from scratch with Image Creator.\n\nThe new Copilot+ Live Captions allows users to translate audio from 40+ languages into English. This will work with any live or recorded audio that comes through your PC speakers. It even works offline and is powered by the NPU.\n\nCopilot+ PCs will be able to use Windows Studio Effects to enhance images with Portrait light, which adjusts your on-screen image for room lighting that might be too dark or bright. It will also offer artistic filters to give you a distinctive, artsy appearance. An eye-contact effect will make you look like you're paying attention when you're looking somewhere else, and voice focus and background blur see improvements.\n\nCopilot will no longer be restricted to a sidebar on Windows PCs: You'll be able to resize it and move it around the screen like any other application. Internally, soon it will also be able to take advantage of the new GPT-4o model from OpenAI.\n\nI'd been hoping for much more PC control with the Copilot updates. The AI is limited to changing a few basic settings such as switching to dark mode or turning on Bluetooth. But its implementation is clunky, requiring you to wait for the AI to slowly respond and then to tap a button saying, yes, you really want to change to dark mode. And though Copilot accepts voice input, there's no wake word functionality, so you still need to mouse over to its button or type Windows Key-C (or the new Copilot key). That rules out asking it things from across the room.", "source": {"uri": "au.pcmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PCMag Australia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "before_that@au.pcmag.com", "name": "Before That", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "apps_for_extremetech@au.pcmag.com", "name": "Apps For ExtremeTech", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surface Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rosetta (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surface Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer keyboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB4", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USB4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DaVinci_Resolve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DaVinci Resolve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-in-1_PC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2-in-1 PC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High dynamic range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_au/news/e/everything/everything-we-saw-at-microsofts-ai-event-copilot-pcs-recall_6wx7.1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 1494, "textEnd": 1501}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Despite bold claims of AI PCs from industry leaders like Intel, AMD, and Nvidia, Microsoft is kicking off the era of the AI PC with a new set of hardware requirements and software features that allow your PC to go beyond an AI chatbot.\n\nThe idea behind Copilot+ isn't to have a few AI features. Instead, the dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) on a Copilot+ PC will run several language models in the background of Windows 11, all the time. The models will scan you through everything you do on your PC to provide context when you want to prompt Copilot properly. Microsoft calls the feature Recall and says it's like a \"sensor for AI.\"\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThis should mean that a Copilot+ PC can recall a line from a multi-page document you scanned a few days ago, follow up on a promise you made in an email from the previous week, or track your web browsing to offer suggestions on websites and services you frequent. There's an obvious privacy concern with all of this, but Microsoft says Copilot+ turns into an AI superpower when it's running at full tilt.\n\nThe constant monitoring is the core of a Copilot+ PC, but the large AI computing power can enable more, according to Microsoft. We've seen dozens of creative tools that leverage AI, from Photoshop's generative AI fill to Microsoft's own AI image generation. With a Copilot+ PC, you could run these functions on your device, saving you time and limiting how often you have to go out to the cloud.\n\nIn order to reach the status of Copilot+, devices need at least 40 Tera Operations Per Second (TOPS) of AI processing power from the NPU. That's a massive jump from what we've seen previously, with Intel's Meteor Lake offering only 10 TOPS on the NPU. Perhaps Microsoft's strict requirements explain why we've seen Intel investing in Lunar Lake so heavily, as well as AMD bolstering its Ryzen AI prowess.\n\nCopilot+ PCs aren't using chips are AMD or Intel, however. The first batch exclusively uses the Snapdragon X Elite or Snapdragon X Plus chip, both of which come with 40 TOPS of AI power. Qualcomm says these chips offer more four times the AI power of competitors chips, and while packing enough power to run games like Baldur's Gate 3 at playable frame rates.\n\nAlthough Copilot+ seems powerful, we've yet to see exactly what it can do in action. Microsoft says you'll be able to turn off the always-on AI tracking, as well as go through snapshots and delete them individually. Hopefully, the new standards for AI on PC will go beyond just the background blur we've seen for the past year.\n\nEditors' Recommendations Dell is doing something it's never done before to the XPS 13 Microsoft says 75% of office workers already use AI at work The next big Windows 11 update has a new hardware requirement Microsoft announces a new threat to push people to Windows 11 How Intel and Microsoft are teaming up to take on Apple", "source": {"uri": "digitaltrends.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Trends"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_roach@digitaltrends.com", "name": "Jacob Roach", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_XML_Paper_Specification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open XML Paper Specification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Microsoft-Copilot-Satya-Nadella.jpeg?resize=800%2C418&p=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The company also demonstrated its Copilot voice assistant acting as a real-time virtual coach to a user playing the \"Minecraft\" video game.\n\nYusuf Mehdi, who heads up consumer marketing for Microsoft, said the company expects that 50 million AI PCs will be purchased over the next year. At the press event, he said faster AI assistants that run directly on a PC will be \"the most compelling reason to upgrade your PC in a long time.\"\n\nMicrosoft executives also said that GPT-4o, the latest technology from OpenAI, will \"soon\" be available as part of Microsoft Copilot.\n\nAnalysts expect Microsoft to introduce a new generation of its own Surface Pro tablet and Surface Laptop that will feature Qualcomm chips based on Arm Holdings' architecture.\n\nAfter Intel's processors dominated the personal computer market for decades, Qualcomm and other makers of lower-power Arm components have tried to compete in the Windows-PC market.\n\nThe Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chips include a so-called neural processing unit that is designed to accelerate AI-focused applications, such as Microsoft's Copilot software.\n\nMicrosoft held the product event a day before the start of its annual developer conference.\n\nMicrosoft aims to extend its early advantage in the race to produce AI tools that consumers are willing to pay for. Its partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI allowed it to jump ahead of Alphabet, as other Big Tech companies race to dominate the emerging field.\n\nLast week, OpenAI and Alphabet's Google showcased dueling AI technologies that can respond via voice in real time and be interrupted, both hallmarks of realistic voice conversations that AI voice assistants have found challenging. Google also announced it was rolling out several generative AI features to its lucrative search engine.\n\nThe PC industry has been under increasing pressure from Apple since the company launched its custom chips based on designs from Arm and ditched Intel's processors.

Microsoft claims these are the \"fastest, most intelligent Windows PC ever built\".\n\nThe PCs come with a dedicated button to prompt the Copilot AI assistant at any time and new AI-powered apps like Recall. This app allows users to search their device for items they can't remember the exact location of using screenshots, phrases or other cues.\n\nUsers will also have access to Cocreator within the Paint app, which enables them to create AI-generated images quickly from text prompts or initial sketches. Live Captions can translate audio from over 40 languages into English in real time.\n\nAs the largest investor in OpenAI, the creators of ChatGPT, Microsoft confirmed that the latest model to power the chatbot, GPT-4o, announced last week, would also be available on Copilot+ PCs. \"This first wave of Copilot+ PCs is just the beginning,\" said Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft's consumer chief marketing officer.\n\nHe added: \"Over the past year, we have seen an incredible pace of innovation of AI in the cloud with Copilot allowing us to do things that we never dreamed possible. Now, we begin a new chapter with AI innovation on the device.\"\n\n\"We have completely reimagined the entirety of the PC, from silicon to the operating system, the application layer to the cloud, with AI at the centre, marking the most significant change to the Window platform in decades.\" The tech giant also confirmed that it was collaborating with many of its third-party hardware partners, including Acer, Dell, Lenovo and Samsung, to launch Copilot+ PCs.\n\nThis announcement from Microsoft comes just days after Google revealed its plans to further incorporate AI into its products in the coming months, which includes revamping its search engine around AI-generated responses, and expanding the reach of its own generative AI assistant, Gemini, to more of its popular apps.\n\nNext month, Apple, another industry titan, is expected to unveil its own AI strategies during its annual developer conference, WWDC, held at its Cupertino headquarters. Industry expert Geoff Blaber, CEO of analyst firm CCS Insight, said the range of announcements demonstrated Microsoft's \"determination\" to be a key player in the AI space.\n\nHe added: \"Microsoft has identified an opportunity to re-energise the PC market, transform the user experience and has galvanised the PC ecosystem to support its vision. If the market needs evidence of Microsoft's determination and drive under Satya Nadella or its commitment to lead in generative AI, Copilot+ is a further proof point.\"\n\n\"Microsoft's efforts to mobilise the ecosystem of manufacturers, silicon partners and developers is impressive and gives Copilot+ credibility at launch. However, success requires Microsoft to overcome several challenges not least, communication to consumers of what a Copilot+ PC is and what it enables that is unique and worth paying a premium for.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martyn_landi@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Martyn Landi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "lawrence_matheson@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Lawrence Matheson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenshot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Screenshot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_marketing_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief marketing officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silicon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/money/article32855474.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_handout-photo-issued-by-microsoft-of-their-chairman-and-ceo-satya-nadella-on-stage-at-an-event-in-redmond-washington.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Calling it \"the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever built\", the Windows maker highlighted that these computers will feature a special chipset capable of more than 40 trillion operations per second (TOPS). Further, these PCs will also offer new AI features such as Recall and Cocreate, as well as integration of third-party apps leveraging AI such as Adobe and CapCut.\n\nCopilot+ PCs are part of Microsoft's AI PC vision and are essentially PC operating systems that allow OEMs to bring out the full potential of the hardware in place to support AI features. This class of PCs will come with specific hardware requirements. In its announcement post, the Windows maker revealed that Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung have all partnered to launch Copilot+ PCs starting June 18. Microsoft will also introduce new Surface devices under this class.\n\nSo, what is new with Copilot+ PCs? Microsoft said these devices will get a new AI-powered Recall feature. Recall lets users visually check their usage history. Users will be able to scroll through a toggle bar to chronologically sift through their timeline as files, folders, and websites appear underneath in a preview box. The company said, \"Copilot+ PCs organise information like we do - based on relationships and associations unique to each of our individual experiences.\"\n\nAnother new feature is Cocreate, a tool for digital art creators, that is available within Paint and Photos. In Paint, as the user draws an image, the AI will also generate a visually similar image taking cues from the user. The user can go to the AI-drawn image and refine it with text prompts.\n\nIn Photos, users can restyle and edit images with AI. Apart from this, Microsoft is also collaborating with third-party apps such as Adobe, CapCut, DaVinci Resolve Studio, Cephable, LiquidText, and more to integrate AI features. Microsoft will also offer access to Copilot, Live Captions, and other AI features announced previously, in these computer systems.\n\nMicrosoft also revealed a range of new Copilot+ PCs that will soon be launched to the public. These include Acer's Swift 14 AI, Asus Vivobook S 15, Dell's XPS 13, Inspiron 14 Plus, Inspiron 14, Latitude 7455, and Latitude 5455, HP's OmniBook X AI PC and EliteBook Ultra G1q AI PC, and Lenovo's Yoga Slim 7x. Samsung's Galaxy Book 4 Edge, which will be launched on June 18, will also be classified as a Copilot+ PC.\n\nMicrosoft also introduced new consumer-focused Surface Pro and Surface Laptop, which will become the company's first-ever Copilot+ PCs. These will also be launched on June 18.", "source": {"uri": "gadgets360.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV Gadgets 360"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chipset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Original equipment manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DaVinci_Resolve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DaVinci Resolve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Swift", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acer Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo_Yoga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo Yoga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Book", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Galaxy Book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surface Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_EliteBook", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HP EliteBook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Latitude", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dell Latitude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_XPS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dell XPS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edge (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Inspiron", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dell Inspiron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surface Laptop"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/copilot_plus_pcs_1716272684636.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 919, "textEnd": 926, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

They can also use the GPT to leverage app functions, such as opening apps and editing photos.\n\nCopilot+ will even be able to add what the user is viewing on-screen into its contextual understanding, helping to make communication with the AI assistant even more natural.\n\nMicrosoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, introduced the Copilot+ PCs in his keynote speech at a Windows event at its headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on Monday: \"The richest AI experiences will harness the power of the cloud and the edge working together in concert.\n\n\"This, in turn, will lead to a new category of devices that turn the world itself into a prompt.\n\n\"Devices that can instantly see us, hear, reason about our intent and our surroundings.\n\n\"For us, this vision starts with our most beloved and most widely used canvas: Windows.\n\nIt is why we are introducing an entirely new class of Windows PCs engineering to unleash the power of distributed AI across the edge and cloud. We call this new category 'Copilot+ PCs'.\"\n\nThe Copilot+ PCs have been branded 'AI PCs' and will run the latest version of Windows 11 and Copilot's AI software. Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft's Executive Vice President and Consumer Chief Marketing Officer, anticipates the company will sell more than 50 million AI PCs over the next year.\n\nTo help showcase the capabilities of Copilot's GPT-4o integration, Microsoft played a pre-recorded demonstration of the technology being used while playing the game Minecraft.\n\nThe user asked Copilot how to craft a sword, and because the AI assistant could see what he was doing in the game, it could give him step-by-step instructions for creating one.\n\nMicrosoft plans to share its newest version, Copilot, within its partner ecosystem, which will include major over-the-top providers (OTPs), such as AMD, Intel, Qualcomm, Acer, ASUS, Dell Technologies, HP, Lenovo, Microsoft Surface, and Samsung.\n\nNadella reinforced its decision to work alongside its partner network to bring GPt-4o-powered Copilot+ to market: \"Whenever you think about a platform like Windows it really comes down to rethinking the core architecture of the PC across silicon, systems, and the end-user experience. That's what we've done.\n\n\"We are introducing new state of the art AI models running locally and continuously to reason over your data from text to the pixels.\n\n\"To make this possible we are introducing a new system on chip. We are also modernising the entire operating system to unleash the power of the SOC and deliver these next generation applications, models, and experiences that are simply just not possible on today's PCs.\n\nThe result is the fastest, most AI-ready Windows PC ever built and just like we have always done with Windows, we are taking a partner-first approach to bring Copilot+ PCs to life.\"\n\nMicrosoft is evidently looking to turn new technological advancements into product format to compete with its major rivals, Apple and Google.\n\nIn fact, the tech giant took some swings at Apple during the Windows event yesterday, highlighting the Copilot+ PCs' performance advantages over comparable Apple devices.\n\nApple is expected to announce the debut of many of its own AI features across its product lines in a few weeks.", "source": {"uri": "uctoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UC Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_stephen@uctoday.com", "name": "James Stephen", "type":

Copilot+ PCs are the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever built; with powerful new silicon capable of 40+ TOPS (trillion operations per second), an all-day battery life and access to the most advanced AI models.\n\nCopilot+ PCs will enable you to do things you can't do on any other PC. It promises to help you find and remember what you have seen on your PC with a new feature called Recall, generate and refine AI images in near real-time directly on the device using Cocreator, and bridge language barriers with Live Captions, translating audio from 40+ languages into English.\n\nThese experiences come to life on a set of thin and light devices from Microsoft Surface and OEM partners Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung.\n\nThe first Copilot+ PCs will launch with the Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus processors. Thanks to the custom Qualcomm Oryon CPU, they feature leading performance per watt and unrivalled performance and battery efficiency.\n\nSnapdragon X Series delivers 45 NPU TOPS all-in-one system on a chip (SoC). The premium integrated Qualcomm Adreno GPU delivers stunning graphics for immersive entertainment. The company hinted at expanding the lineup through partnerships with Intel and AMD, starting with Lunar Lake and Strix chipsets. Expect to see devices with powerful graphics cards like NVIDIA GeForce RTX and AMD Radeon, bringing Copilot+ PC experiences to reach even broader audiences like advanced gamers and creators.\n\nUp until now, we have seen AI innovation in the cloud. Microsoft sees this new series of Copilot+ PCs as AI innovation on the device, completely reimagining the entirety of the PC -- from silicon to the operating system, the application layer to the cloud -- with AI at the centre. Microsoft says this is the most significant change to the Windows platform in decades.\n\nAn all-new system architecture brings the power of the CPU, GPU and now a new high-performance Neural Processing Unit (NPU) together. Connected to and enhanced by the large language models (LLMs) running in the company's Azure Cloud in concert with small language models (SLMs), Copilot+ PCs can now achieve a performance never seen before.\n\nThese new Windows PCs are up to 20x more powerful and up to 100x as efficient for running AI workloads and delivering industry-leading AI acceleration. all while delivering all-day battery life. With incredible efficiency, Copilot+ PCs can deliver up to 22 hours of local video playback or 15 hours of web browsing on a single charge.\n\nEvery Copilot+ PC comes secured out of the box. The Microsoft Pluton Security processor will be enabled by default on all Copilot+ PCs and a number of new features, updates and defaults to Windows 11 make it easy for users to stay secure.\n\nCopilot+ PCs leverage powerful processors and multiple state-of-the-art AI models, including several of Microsoft's world-class SLMs, to unlock a new set of experiences you can run locally, directly on the device. This removes previous limitations like latency, cost and even privacy.\n\nNow, with Recall, you can access virtually what you have seen or done on your PC in a way that makes it feel like you have a photographic memory. Copilot+ PCs organize information as we do - based on relationships and associations unique to our experiences. This helps you remember things you may have forgotten so you can find what you're looking for quickly and intuitively by simply using the cues you remember.\n\nYou can scroll across time to find the content you need in your timeline across any application, website, document, or more. Interact intuitively using snapshots to help you take the next step using suggested actions based on object recognition. And get back to where you were, whether through a specific email in Outlook or the right chat in Teams.\n\nRecall leverages your personalised semantic index, built and stored entirely on your device. Your snapshots are yours; they stay locally on your PC. You can delete individual snapshots, adjust and delete time ranges in Settings, or pause at any point right from the icon in the System Tray on your Taskbar.

Copilot, Microsoft's brand of generative AI, will soon be far more deeply integrated into the Windows 11 experience. And new Microsoft Surface devices are on the way.\n\nWe've rounded up all the major announcements here.\n\nCopilot+ PCs are Microsoft's vision of AI-first, flagship Windows hardware. All include dedicated chips called NPUs to power AI experiences like Recall. And they ship with 16GB of RAM minimum, paired with SSD storage.\n\nThe first Copilot+ PCs will pack Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite and Plus chips, which Microsoft claims delivers up to 15 hours of web browsing and 20 hours of video battery life. Chipmakers Intel and AMD are also committed to building processors for Copilot+ devices in partnership with a range of manufacturers, including Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung.\n\nCopilot+ PCs start at $999, and some are available for preorder today.\n\nMicrosoft's newly unveiled Surface devices, the Surface Laptop and Surface Pro, focus on performance and battery.\n\nThe latest Surface Laptop -- available with a 13.8- or 15-inch display -- has been redesigned with \"modern lines\" and thinner screen bezels. It lasts up to 22 hours on a charge and is up to 86% faster than the Surface Laptop 5, the company says. It also supports Wi-Fi 7 and has a haptic feedback touchpad.\n\nAs for the new Surface Pro, Microsoft says it's up to 90% faster than the previous-gen Surface Pro (the Surface Pro 9), and it sports a new OLED with HDR display, Wi-Fi 7 (and optional 5G) and an upgraded ultrawide front-facing camera. Also, its detachable keyboard -- which has been reinforced with additional carbon fiber -- now has haptic feedback.\n\nWindows 11's forthcoming Recall feature can \"remember\" apps and content a user accessed on their PC weeks or even months ago, for example helping them to find a Discord chat where they were discussing clothes they were considering buying. Users can use Recall's timeline to \"scroll back\" to see what they were working on in the recent past and drill down in files like PowerPoint presentations to surface info potentially relevant to their searches.\n\nMicrosoft says that Recall can create associations between colors, images and more to let users search for practically anything on their PCs in natural language (not dissimilar to startup Rewind's tech). And the company claims that all user data associated with Recall is kept private and on-device -- and not used to train AI models, importantly.\n\nHere's more from Microsoft: \"Your snapshots are yours; they stay locally on your PC. You can delete individual snapshots, adjust and delete ranges of time in Settings, or pause at any point right from the icon in the System Tray on your Taskbar. You can also filter apps and websites from ever being saved.\"\n\nThere's now more AI in Windows than ever and some of it exclusively on the new Copilot+ PCs.\n\nA new feature called Super Resolution can restore old photos by automatically upscaling them. And Copilot can now analyze images to give users ideas for creative compositions. Through a feature called Cocreator, users can generate images and also ask the AI model to follow what they're drawing to change or restyle the image.\n\nElsewhere, Live Captions with live translations translates any audio that passes through a PC -- whether from YouTube or a local file -- into the language of the user's choosing. Live translations will initially support around 40 languages including English, Spanish, Mandarin and Russian.\n\nPowering capabilities such as Recall and Super Resolution is the Windows Copilot Runtime, a collection of ~40 generative AI models that make up what Microsoft describes as \"a new layer\" of Windows. In tandem with the semantic index, a vector-based system local to an individual Copilot+ PC, the Windows Copilot Runtime allows generative AI-powered apps -- including third-party apps -- to run without necessarily needing an internet connection.\n\nMicrosoft says that CapCut, the popular video editor from TikTok owner ByteDance, will use the Windows Copilot Runtime to speed up its AI features.", "source": {"uri": "techcrunch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechCrunch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_wiggers@techcrunch.com", "name": "Kyle Wiggers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Surface Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Surface Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haptic technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Surface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solid-state drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Pro_9", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surface Pro 9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Laptop_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surface Laptop 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High dynamic range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ByteDance", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ByteDance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1238869000.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Microsoft's new era of AI PCs explained", "body": "On May 20, Microsoft announced a new range of \"Copilot+ PCs\" at a private event ahead of this week's Microsoft Build developer conference. Microsoft's own redesigned Surface Pro and Surface Laptop were the first devices announced in this new collection of AI PCs, but more are on the way from Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung.\n\nCopilot+ PCs are taking on-device AI features to a new level, offering serious competition for Apple just a few weeks before its own developer conference in June. What makes these Copilot+ PCs unique? Are the new AI features worth buying a Copilot+ device?\n\nHere's a look at Copilot+ PCs and what they have to offer, from AI search to image generation and more.\n\nTuesday's Microsoft event kicked off a new era for AI PCs, which Microsoft dubbed \"Copilot+ PCs.\" The new Microsoft Surface Laptop and Surface Pro are the first devices in the line-up, but other manufacturers are getting in on the action, including Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung. Chipmakers Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm will make AI-powered processors for the new range of devices.\n\nMicrosoft Corporate Vice President Yusuf Mehdi noted at Tuesday's event that Copilot+ PCs will be \"58% faster than MacBook Air M3.\" Demos during the event included side-by-side comparisons with the MacBook Air, taking aim at Apple as it gears up to announce AI features of its own at WWDC 2024.\n\nCopilot+ PCs function the same as any conventional laptop, but use on-device AI for enhanced performance and features. On-device AI allows users to take advantage of AI tools without worrying about their data privacy. So, you can use a Copilot+ PC for everything you already love to use your laptop for, only now you can also tap into a wide array of AI-powered features, tools, and app integrations.\n\nThere are plenty of tools to try out, as well. Copilot+ PCs will be able to search using natural language, generate images locally, improve performance in creative apps like Adobe Photoshop, and more. Copilot can even give you hints during gaming sessions thanks to an Xbox integration.\n\nCopilot+ PCs will now use GPT-4o in Windows 11 for natural language processing and recognizing visual content. Those capabilities will come in handy now with new features like \"Recall,\" which allows users to ask Copilot to find things for them on their device using natural language.\n\nFor example, you could ask Copilot to find the email you were drafting over the weekend and it would pull it up in your files for you using Recall. The Recall function can help you find things not only in your files but across apps, as well. For instance, one of the demos at Tuesday's event included using Recall to help with online shopping.\n\nPrivacy-minded users don't need to worry about Recall compromising their data security since it will run entirely on-device. Plus, users can control what data Copilot sees and stores for Recall through a new Windows Semantic Index tool. Regardless of the data you choose to allow Copilot to use, none will be going to the cloud or leaving your device.\n\nMicrosoft also announced a tool called Cocreator, which uses generative AI for on-device image generation. The NPUs in Copilot+ PCs will help with a variety of creative tasks in third-party apps, as well, such as Adobe Photoshop and DaVinci Resolve. We can expect to see even more collaborations and app integrations as more Copilot+ PCs are unveiled.", "source": {"uri": "laptopmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LaptopMag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stevie_bonifield@laptopmag.com", "name": "Stevie Bonifield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Surface Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Surface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surface Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_(magazine)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural language processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shopping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online shopping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Disk_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Disk Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m9ELxJ7MhvjLwj5pwxbpMG-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 3, "textEnd": 9}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Alongside the hardware are important new software capabilities, all of which center on Microsoft's Copilot AI offerings. The technology is intended to finally make running Windows 11 on Arm palatable and desirable in terms of speed, compatibility, and support for on-device AI processing. Here's everything Microsoft showed off today.\n\nNew Surface Laptop and Surface Pro\n\nIn March, Microsoft unveiled the Surface Pro 10 for Business and Surface Laptop 6 for Business, and today we got consumer versions of Microsoft's hardware.\n\nThe Surface Pro runs the Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus processors. It comes with a 13.8- or 15-inch display and there's an optional OLED with HDR technology option on the 13-inch. It has two USB 4 ports, Wi-Fi 7 support, and optional 5G support. A new Surface Pro Flex Keyboard is the first 2-in-1 keyboard designed to be used both attached or detached, Microsoft says.\n\nMicrosoft says the Surface Laptop is 86% faster than Laptop 5 and promises the \"longest battery life on any Surface\" -- up to 22 hours on the 15-inch Surface Laptop and 20 hours on the 13.8-inch. This one also supports Wi-Fi 7.\n\nThe new Surfaces start at $999 and launch on June 18. Stay tuned for our hands ons.\n\nPrism Lets You Run Any Windows App on Arm PCs\n\nPrism is analogous to Apple's Rosetta 2 transcoding software that enables non-Arm software to run well on the newer Apple Silicon CPUs. Basing a PC on Arm makes for far better battery life, cheaper production, and smaller chips. If Microsoft's Prism can reach the performance level that Rosetta delivers, it will finally be realistic to expect large-scale adoption of Windows PCs using Arm processors. As with Rosetta 2, applications that take advantage of Prism won't require any special optimization to run on Arm-based PCs.\n\nNative Arm Apps for Windows\n\nAt today's event, Microsoft rattled off a list of big software titles that have been updated to run natively on Windows systems powered by Arm chips, which should deliver better performance than apps using Prism. They include Microsoft's own Teams, PowerPoint, Outlook, Word, Excel, OneDrive, and OneNote.\n\nBut big third-party software houses have jumped on board as well, with Chrome, Spotify, Zoom, WhatsApp, Blender, Affinity Suite, and DaVinci Resolve now all getting native Arm versions for Windows. In particular, the Adobe apps (with Firefly) and DaVinci Resolve make extensive use of AI for media editing, so the ability to run these faster on Arm will be welcome.\n\nRecall\n\nWith Windows 11, Microsoft abandoned Windows 10's Timeline feature, which allowed you to easily review and return to previously used apps. The new Recall feature for Copilot+ PCs is an AI-charged reincarnation of Timeline and lets users perform intuitive searches through their files, internet history, and more.\n\nRecall uses a semantic index with a timeline, so it can understand content and context in time. According to Microsoft, its results are based on \"relationships and associations unique to each of our individual experiences.\" That could pop up privacy red flags for some users, but Microsoft states that a user's personal index is stored entirely on the local device.\n\nCocreator: Generate and Refine Images Locally\n\nCopilot can already generate images using Microsoft Designer (powered by Dall-E 3), but that's done on Microsoft's servers. With the new Microsoft Paint Cocreator features, Copilot+ PCs will be able to handle these functions locally, meaning less waiting and better privacy.\n\nThe Microsoft Photos app included with Windows 11 now has some generative AI features of its own, including the ability to blur or remove the background in a photo.\n\nCopilot+ PCs will add the ability to change the style of a photo with options like \"Cyberpunk or Claymation\" and you'll be able to generate images from scratch with Image Creator.\n\nLive Captions\n\nThe new Copilot+ Live Captions allows users to translate audio from 40+ languages into English. This will work with any live or recorded audio that comes through your PC speakers. It even works offline and is powered by the NPU.\n\nVideo Call Enhancements\n\nCopilot+ PCs will be able to use Windows Studio Effects to enhance images with Portrait light, which adjusts your on-screen image for room lighting that might be too dark or bright. It will also offer artistic filters to give you a distinctive, artsy appearance. An eye-contact effect will make you look like you're paying attention when you're looking somewhere else, and voice focus and background blur see improvements.\n\nCopilot Becomes a Regular App\n\nCopilot will no longer be restricted to a sidebar on Windows PCs: You'll be able to resize it and move it around the screen like any other application. Internally, soon it will also be able to take advantage of the new GPT-4o model from OpenAI.\n\nWhat's Missing in Copilot's New Features?\n\nI'd been hoping for much more PC control with the Copilot updates. The AI is limited to changing a few basic settings such as switching to dark mode or turning on Bluetooth. But its implementation is clunky, requiring you to wait for the AI to slowly respond and then to tap a button saying, yes, you really want to change to dark mode. And though Copilot accepts voice input, there's no wake word functionality, so you still need to mouse over to its button or type Windows Key-C (or the new Copilot key). That rules out asking it things from across the room.", "source": {"uri": "pcmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PC Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_muchmore@pcmag.com", "name": "Michael Muchmore", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surface Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rosetta (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surface Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer keyboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB4", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USB4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DaVinci_Resolve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DaVinci Resolve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-in-1_PC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2-in-1 PC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High dynamic range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet_PCs", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet PCs", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/01gxPZ0LQnXjzYUWwcaXxwg-6.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1716236082.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 1530, "textEnd": 1537}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Other computer makers like Lenovo, Dell, HP, Asus, Acer and Samsung are also launching AI-ready PCs powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus processors, which promise longer battery life and will run Microsoft's Copilot AI chatbot.\n\nThe computers adhere to Microsoft's new Copilot+ standard that feature a minimum amount of performance, storage and memory. Copilot+ PCs with AMD and Intel chips will follow, Microsoft said during a press keynote on its campus in Redmond, Washington. The PCs will be able to translate audio, recommend responses to incoming messages and suggest changes in the Settings app and even talk with people about what's on screen.\n\nA Recall feature will be able to search through a log of previous actions on PCs. Recall relies on AI models that run directly on the device, so it can run offline, and an index of the data never goes to remote servers. And AI models will be able to generate images based on written descriptions as well as drawings.\n\nMicrosoft is banking on Qualcomm's energy-efficient Arm-based chips that can handle AI models to defend its Windows franchise. Apple has gained market share in PC shipments with MacBooks containing its Arm-based chips, having moved away from Intel, which remains the top provider of computer processors.\n\nThe development marks Microsoft's latest effort to surround consumers and corporate workers with ChatGPT-like capabilities. OpenAI released the ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022, and it quickly took off as a tool for quickly obtaining computer-generated poems, email drafts and summaries of historical events. Within nearly two months, 100 million people were using it.\n\nMicrosoft and other large technology companies were soon working to augment their products with generative AI. A Copilot chatbot drawing on ChatGPT's underlying AI models came to the Bing search engine, along with the Windows 10 and 11 operating systems. Those with Office productivity software subscriptions could pay extra to have a Copilot refer to their documents for written responses.\n\nBut the GPT-4 model inside ChatGPT has only done its necessary computing work in Microsoft's Azure cloud. These new PCs models can run AI some models locally, without requiring an internet connection. The launch comes nearly four months after Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts on the company's earnings call that \"in 2024, AI will become a first-class part of every PC.\"\n\nMicrosoft has had little success in getting people to adopt Arm-based Windows computers. They haven't always performed as well as computers running Intel or AMD chips, and certain applications have been incompatible. But running generative AI locally means computers will need more power, and strong battery life will be more critical. That might make Windows on Arm more compelling.\n\nAnalysts with Morgan Stanley expect Arm systems to be 14% of all Windows PC shipments in 2026, up from 0% in 2023, according to a note distributed to clients earlier this month.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GPT-4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Stanley"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/05/107417246-1716214624819-gettyimages-2150291284-INDONESIA_MICROSOFT.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

At a pre-Build event on Monday, which was not livestreamed for the public, Microsoft introduced its vision for AI-centric PCs with the new Copilot+ PCs and announced the latest Surface devices.\n\nCopilot+ PCs\n\nThe highlight of the event was the introduction of Copilot+ PCs, designed to handle generative AI processes locally rather than relying on cloud computing. These PCs require a neural processing unit (NPU) performance of at least 40 TOPs (trillions of operations per second), along with a minimum of 16GB RAM and 256GB storage. This approach echoes strategies seen in flagship smartphones like Google Pixel devices.\n\nMicrosoft has redesigned the Windows PC infrastructure to integrate the CPU, GPU, and NPU, collaborating with AMD, Intel, Qualcomm, and various laptop manufacturers. According to Microsoft, Copilot+ PCs are 58% faster than the M3-powered MacBook Air, capable of running multiple small language models locally to power features like a new standalone Copilot app.\n\nCopilot+ features\n\nA notable feature of Copilot+ PCs is Recall, allowing users to find past activities on their PC using natural language prompts. This tool can search emails, documents, and chat threads, ensuring data remains on the device.\n\nAdditionally, Copilot is getting a revamped app, usable as a sidebar, standalone window, or fullscreen. Users can drag items into Copilot for context-specific assistance. Microsoft Paint now includes Cocreator for image generation, while Live Captions will translate languages in real-time, and Super Resolution will enhance image restoration in Windows Photos. Microsoft also introduced Auto Super Resolution for gaming, similar to NVIDIA's DLSS, aiming to upscale graphics and improve refresh rates without compromising performance.\n\nNew Surface models\n\nMicrosoft also unveiled new consumer-focused Surface devices, marking the first among Copilot+ PCs. The latest Surface Laptop features thinner bezels and Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chipset, available in 13.8-inch and 15-inch sizes. The laptop is claimed to be over 86% faster than the Surface Laptop 5, offering up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD storage. The 15-inch model promises up to 22 hours of local video playback and 15 hours of web browsing on a single charge. The Surface Laptop starts at $999 and will be available from 18 June.\n\nThe Surface Pro now includes an OLED display option, reportedly 90% faster than its predecessor, with up to 14 hours of local video playback per charge. The LCD version starts at $1,000, while the OLED model begins at $1,500. However, users will need to purchase a physical keyboard separately, with the new Flex Keyboard priced at $350, or $450 with a Surface Pen bundle.\n\nThird-party laptops: expanding the Copilot+ ecosystem\n\nSeveral third-party OEMs are joining the Copilot+ initiative, including Samsung, ASUS, Lenovo, Acer, and Dell. HP introduced the Omnibook X and Elitebook Ultra, with the Omnibook X featuring Snapdragon X Elite and a battery life of up to 26 hours for local video playback. The Omnibook X starts at $1,200, while the Elitebook Ultra is priced from $1,700. Both models will ship on 18 June.\n\nWindows 11: redesigned for Arm and AI\n\nWith Qualcomm's Arm architecture, Microsoft is enhancing Windows 11 to better support AI and efficiency. Windows 11 now includes AI APIs, a new kernel and compiler, and an emulator called Prism to run x86 and x64 apps, which is 20% faster than previous emulators. Key third-party apps like Chrome, Spotify, Zoom, and Adobe software will run natively on Arm-based Windows 11.", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Pixel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google Pixel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surface Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Paint", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Paint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thread (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://tds-images.thedailystar.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2024/05/21/lcimg_6424ab49_1ec1_44ff_b159_0219a47b8c79.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 2655, "textEnd": 2662, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

The company also demonstrated its Copilot voice assistant acting as a real-time virtual coach to a user playing the \"Minecraft\" video game.\n\nYusuf Mehdi, who heads up consumer marketing for Microsoft, said the company expects that 50 million AI PCs will be purchased over the next year. At the press event, he said faster AI assistants that run directly on a PC will be \"the most compelling reason to upgrade your PC in a long time.\"\n\nGlobal PC shipments dipped about 15% to 242 million last year, according to research firm Gartner, which suggests Microsoft expects the new category of computers to account for around one-fifth of all PCs sold.\n\n\"People just need to be convinced that the device experience alone justifies this entirely new category of Copilot+ machines,\" said analyst Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies.\n\nMicrosoft's new \"Copilot+\" computer marketing category that highlights AI features is reminiscent of the \"Ultrabook\" category of thin-form Windows laptops that Intel promoted with PC manufacturers in 2011 to compete against Apple's MacBook Air.\n\nMicrosoft executives also said that GPT-4o, the latest technology from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, will \"soon\" be available as part of Microsoft Copilot.\n\nMicrosoft also introduced a new generation of its own Surface Pro tablet and Surface Laptop that feature Qualcomm chips based on Arm Holdings' architecture. The company also introduced a technology called Prism that will help software written for Intel and AMD chips run on chips made with Arm technology.\n\nMicrosoft showed its new devices in action against an Apple device, showing photo editing software from Adobe running faster on the Microsoft device. Apple earlier this month showed a new AI-focused chip that analysts expect to be used in future laptops.\n\nAfter Intel's processors dominated the PC market for decades, Qualcomm and other makers of lower-power Arm components have tried to compete in the Windows-PC market.\n\nThe Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chips include a so-called neural processing unit that is designed to accelerate AI-focused applications, such as Microsoft's Copilot software.\n\nMicrosoft held the product event a day before the start of its annual developer conference.\n\nMicrosoft aims to extend its early advantage in the race to produce AI tools that consumers are willing to pay for. Its partnership with OpenAI allowed it to jump ahead of Alphabet as other Big Tech companies race to dominate the emerging field.\n\nLast week, OpenAI and Alphabet's Google showcased dueling AI technologies that can respond via voice in real time and be interrupted, both hallmarks of realistic voice conversations that AI voice assistants have found challenging. Google also announced it was rolling out several generative AI features to its lucrative search engine.\n\nThe PC industry has been under increasing pressure from Apple since the company launched its custom chips based on designs from Arm and ditched Intel's processors. The Apple-designed processors have given Mac computers superior battery life and speedier performance than rivals' chips that use more energy.\n\nMicrosoft tapped Qualcomm to lead the effort to move the Windows operating system to Arm's chip designs in 2016. Qualcomm has exclusivity on Microsoft Windows devices that expires this year. Other chip designers such as Nvidia have efforts under way to make their own Arm-based PC chips, Reuters has previously reported.\n\n(Reporting by Max A.

The company has now outlined a handful of big new AI features coming to Windows 11 next month alongside the launch of these new Copilot+ PCs shipping this summer.\n\nAll Copilot+ PCs are shipping with a built-in neural processing unit (NPU) that's able to output 45 TOPS of power. That appears to be the baseline requirement for many of the next-gen AI features Microsoft has announced. Because of this, your current PC will not be gaining access to any of these new AI features, at least for now. Microsoft says you need to buy a new Copilot+ PC to use them.\n\nSo, what new AI features are being introduced to Windows 11 next month?\n\nMicrosoft's new Recall feature is easily the most interesting AI feature coming to Windows 11 this year. It's a tool that runs in the background and can captures snapshots of everything you see and do on your computer, enabling the ability to search for anything you've ever done on your PC with natural language.\n\nIt features a timeline interface that runs along the very top of the screen and lets the user scroll back through points in time based on the users inputted search criteria. Recall is able to document everything it sees on screen, including apps, sentences, webpages, documents, photos, videos, and more.\n\nWith Recall, you can search for pretty much anything that you've done or seen. For example, a user could type \"find that picture of a dinosaur that Sarah sent me on WhatsApp\" and the AI will be able to bring up the exact moment when that image was shared with you.\n\nMicrosoft says this feature is 100% privacy focused. All the data Recall creates is handled by the on-device NPU, and is never sent to the cloud to be processed. Microsoft says it does not use any of the Recall data to train its AI models, and are assuring us that the data simply never leaves your computer. The user is free to turn off Recall if they don't want to use it.\n\nMicrosoft is updating Windows Studio Effects to be even more advanced, with new artificial lighting and artistic filters that can be applied to your webcam video feed in any app.\n\nThe new artificial lighting feature will help improve your video quality when in a dimly lit environment. It helps clear up any noise in the video feed and brighten your face as if you were turning on a ring or face light. The artistic filters are quite amazing too.\n\nAn impressive new accessibility feature is coming to Windows 11's Live Captions feature, which now uses AI to translate 40+ different languages from live or pre-recorded audio and video in real-time, directly on the device.\n\nMicrosoft has also elevated the Live Captions button to the very top level of the Windows 11 Control Center, making it even easier to access and enable when you need it. Now, you can be on a call with people who don't speak your language, and still understand them thanks to AI in Live Captions.\n\nWe've already seen a handful of new generative AI experiences make their way to Windows 11 over the last 12 months, including the ability to generate images in Paint, blur or remove the background in the Photos app, and Copilot for Windows itself.\n\nNow, on PCs Copilot+ PCs, Microsoft is touting improved performance of Copilot and Cocreator, with the ability to run some generative AI experiences on-device. Not being required to reach out to the cloud for everything should speed up performance for basic queries and reduce reliance on Microsoft's AI servers.\n\nCocreator can also help you bring to life a sketch. In Paint, you can draw a simple image, then ask Cocreator to take it further.\n\nMicrosoft has already talked a bit about Super Resolution, but today it's been confirmed that Copilot+ PCs are able to utilize AI to enhance the framerate and quality of some video games, artificially increasing the performance of them on the fly using the dedicated NPU that are found in all Copilot+ PCs.", "source": {"uri": "windowscentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Windows Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zac_bowden@windowscentral.com", "name": "Zac Bowden", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(signal_processing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filter (signal processing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Webcam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Noise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accessibility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i3RPMr3GxXoffYV7AQxf4a-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Microsoft says Copilot+ PCs will offer long battery life while delivering better performance than a MacBook Air with an M3 chip. And they'll support a number of new AI experiences.\n\nIn a nutshell, Microsoft says a Copilot+ PC needs to meet the following requirements:\n\nEvery major PC maker has partnered with Microsoft to deliver Copilot+ PCs, and the first computers to meet those specifications will all be powered by Qualcomm's new Snapdragon X Plus or Snapdragon X Elite processors. But during Microsoft's announcement, the company was careful to include comments from Intel and AMD noting that they fully support the Copilot+ initiative, suggesting that we'll see Copilot+ PCs with chips from those companies in the future.\n\nBut starting with Snapdragon chips means that in addition to a high-performance NPU, the new systems will also have energy-efficient processors with strong single-core and multi-core CPU performance and a high-performance integrated GPU as well.\n\nAnd while performance will likely be best for apps that are compiled to run natively on ARM-based chips (including Chrome, Photoshop, and Spotify), Microsoft says it's built a new emulation tool called Prism that works like Apple's Rosetta 2, allowing x86 application to run quickly and efficiently on systems with Snapdragon X processors.\n\nMicrosoft says you can expect up to 18 hours of battery life while web browsing, or up to 22 hours of battery life during offline video playback from a Copilot+ PC. And the company says to expect systems with these new chips to offer 23% faster peak performance than an Apple MacBook Air with an M3 processor, or 58% faster sustained performance.\n\nKeep in mind that Microsoft didn't spell out which Snapdragon chip delivers those results, or what benchmarks it was running. So take those promises with a grain of salt.\n\nSo what exactly are you supposed to use that shiny new NPU on a Copilot+ PC for? Microsoft laid out a number of examples, but in a nutshell the company is building 40+ AI models into Windows 11, enabling support for AI-enhanced capabilities in a wide range of activities, many of which will leverage your computer's hardware for on-device processing (which means nothing needs to be sent to the cloud, helping speed things up and potentially addressing some privacy and security concerns).\n\nFor example, there's a new CoCreator feature that will let you do some of the things we've come to expect from cloud-based AI services including generating images from text-based prompts.\n\nBut here are some of the other things Microsoft showcased during its launch event:\n\nRecall, specifically, sounds like it could be a privacy nightmare if your data were sent to the cloud for processing. But Microsoft says it's committed to \"responsible AI.\" In addition to leveraging the NPU for local processing, the company promises that your data will not be used to train AI models, and users an exclude apps from Recall and/or delete specific content.\n\nThat said, Copilot+ PCs will be able to tap into Microsoft's Azure cloud services for some tasks that may not be possible using only on-device hardware. And Microsoft is being a little vague about which of the new features it's announced will run entirely locally and which will require offloading some processing to the cloud.", "source": {"uri": "liliputing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liliputing"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brad_linder@liliputing.com", "name": "Brad Linder", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ARM architecture family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "X86"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rosetta (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emulator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multi-core processor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google Chrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://liliputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/copilot-plus.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Copilot+ PCs can also generate and refine AI images on-device using Cocreator, and translate over forty languages with Live Captions.\n\nThe new Copilot+ PCs also promise extended \"all-day\" battery life even though they are capable of 40+ trillion operations per second (TOPS).\n\n\"With Recall, you can access virtually what you have seen or done on your PC in a way that feels like having photographic memory,\" Microsoft said. \"This helps you remember things you may have forgotten so you can find what you're looking for quickly and intuitively by simply using the cues you remember.\"\n\nThe prospect of Windows constantly recording everything users see and do, making it possible to find even snippets of text that appeared on screen quickly, sparked both praise and concern. Many tech pundits praised it as a \"cool\" feature.\n\nCommentators compared Microsoft's new Recall feature to Rewind -- now Limitless AI -- which developed a similar AI tool that used persistent screen recordings to make it possible to find past actions quickly.\n\nBeginning June 18, Copilot+ PCs will be available from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung.\n\n\"[The] interesting thing, which is if you sort of take all of what we've been talking about with AI, it all came about because of the abundance of compute, all primarily in the cloud,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told the Wall Street Journal ahead of Monday's announcements. \"So that's what created the GPT-4 for example, which essentially changed the world.\n\n\"Now what happened in the cloud is going to come to the [Microsoft] Edge and the Edge that first needs to be reinvented before we talk about everything else is the PC,\" he continued. \"That's what I think of as the 'AI PC' or the Copilot+ PCs.\"\n\nAs Nadella explained, the new Copilot+ PCs will utilize cloud computing and internal computing, using a new processor called the Neural Processing Unit (NPU).\n\n\"So if you want to build any AI application, you have to have an accelerator, just like we have in the cloud to be able to run these matrix math multiplications fast in order to drive our AI features,\" Nadella said. \"And that's what the NPU does.\"\n\nTo make accessing Copilot even easier, Microsoft in January announced that a dedicated hardware AI key would be coming to Windows 11 keyboards.\n\n\"Every Copilot+ PC comes with your personal powerful AI agent that is just a single tap away on keyboards with the new Copilot key,\" Microsoft wrote at the time. \"Copilot will now have the full application experience customers have been asking for in a streamlined, simple yet powerful and personal design.\"\n\nRumors around Microsoft's plans to add Copilot to Windows began circulating in December. The official update, code-named \"Hudson Valley,\" replaces Microsoft's Cortana virtual assistant, which was discontinued last August.\n\nLike Google, and Amazon, Microsoft has invested heavily in generative AI, including over $10 billion investment in ChatGPT creator, OpenAI, according to a report by the New York Times. Leveraging its partnership with OpenAI, Copilot comes with several of the AI developer's products, including Dall-E 3 for image generation.\n\n\"Copilot puts the most advanced AI models at your fingertips,\" the tech giant said. \"In the coming weeks, get access to the latest models, including GPT-4o, from our partners at OpenAI, so you can have voice conversations that feel more natural.\"\n\nMicrosoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.", "source": {"uri": "decrypt.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Decrypt"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_nelson@decrypt.co", "name": "Jason Nelson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GPT-4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edge (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortana_(virtual_assistant)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cortana (virtual assistant)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/height/512/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/microsoft-blockchain-scalability-gID_7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 1542, "textEnd": 1549}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

The company also demonstrated its Copilot voice assistant acting as a real-time virtual coach to a user playing the \"Minecraft\" video game.\n\nYusuf Mehdi, who heads up consumer marketing for Microsoft, said the company expects that 50 million AI PCs will be purchased over the next year. At the press event, he said faster AI assistants that run directly on a PC will be \"the most compelling reason to upgrade your PC in a long time.\"\n\nMicrosoft executives also said that GPT-4o, the latest technology from OpenAI, will \"soon\" be available as part of Microsoft Copilot.\n\nAnalysts expect Microsoft to introduce a new generation of its own Surface Pro tablet and Surface Laptop that will feature Qualcomm chips based on Arm Holdings' architecture.\n\nAfter Intel's processors dominated the personal computer market for decades, Qualcomm and other makers of lower-power Arm components have tried to compete in the Windows-PC market.\n\nThe Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chips include a so-called neural processing unit that is designed to accelerate AI-focused applications, such as Microsoft's Copilot software.\n\nMicrosoft held the product event a day before the start of its annual developer conference.\n\nMicrosoft aims to extend its early advantage in the race to produce AI tools that consumers are willing to pay for. Its partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI allowed it to jump ahead of Alphabet, as other Big Tech companies race to dominate the emerging field.\n\nLast week, OpenAI and Alphabet's Google showcased dueling AI technologies that can respond via voice in real time and be interrupted, both hallmarks of realistic voice conversations that AI voice assistants have found challenging. Google also announced it was rolling out several generative AI features to its lucrative search engine.\n\nThe PC industry has been under increasing pressure from Apple since the company launched its custom chips based on designs from Arm and ditched Intel's processors. The Apple-designed processors have given Mac computers superior battery life and speedier performance than rivals' chips that use more energy.\n\nMicrosoft tapped Qualcomm to lead the effort to move the Windows operating system to Arm's chip designs in 2016. Qualcomm has exclusivity on Microsoft Windows devices that expires this year. Other chip designers such as Nvidia have efforts under way to make their own Arm-based PC chips, Reuters has previously reported.\n\n(Reporting by Max A.

The company also introduced a technology called Prism that will help software written for Intel and AMD chips run on chips made with Arm technology.\n\nMicrosoft showed its new devices in action against an Apple device, showing photo editing software from Adobe running faster on the Microsoft device. Apple earlier this month showed a new AI-focused chip that analysts expect to be used in future laptops.\n\nAfter Intel's processors dominated the PC market for decades, Qualcomm and other makers of lower-power Arm components have tried to compete in the Windows PC market.\n\nThe Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chips include a so-called neural processing unit that is designed to accelerate AI-focused applications, such as Microsoft's Copilot software.\n\nMicrosoft held the product event a day before the start of its annual developer conference.\n\nMicrosoft aims to extend its early advantage in the race to produce AI tools that consumers are willing to pay for. Its partnership with OpenAI allowed it to jump ahead of Alphabet as other Big Tech companies race to dominate the emerging field.\n\nLast week, OpenAI and Alphabet's Google showcased duelling AI technologies that can respond via voice in real-time and be interrupted, both hallmarks of realistic voice conversations that AI voice assistants have found challenging.\n\nGoogle also announced it was rolling out several generative AI features to its lucrative search engine.\n\nThe PC industry has been under increasing pressure from Apple since the company launched its custom chips based on designs from Arm and ditched Intel's processors.\n\nThe Apple-designed processors have given Mac computers superior battery life and speedier performance than rivals' chips that use more energy.\n\nMicrosoft tapped Qualcomm to lead the effort to move the Windows operating system to Arm's chip designs in 2016. Qualcomm has exclusivity on Microsoft Windows devices that expire this year.\n\nOther chip designers such as Nvidia have efforts underway to make their own Arm-based PC chips, Reuters has previously reported.", "source": {"uri": "myjoyonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyJoyOnline.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arm (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrabook", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultrabook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Microsoft.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 780, "textEnd": 787, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

However, think about a computer that's made to work with AI tools, and Apple's machine probably falls to the bottom of the list. (Provided you can even name a computer made for AI in the first place.)\n\nThere's an opportunity, then, for Apple's competition to not just solidify its laptops as more powerful and efficient than the MacBook for most tasks, but to make them stand out for having the tech necessary to power the latest AI features. That's the target Microsoft is trying to hit with its just announced line of Copilot+ PCs.\n\nCopilot+ PCs, powered by Qualcomm\n\n\"Copilot+ PCs\" is Microsoft's name for a new wave of AI-powered machines coming from companies like Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung, not to mention Microsoft's own Surface lineup. (More on that below.) Many of these machines, including the new Surfaces, are powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus, Arm-based chips that Microsoft and other OEMs hope will convince users to move away from Apple. The Plus has a 10-core CPU, while the Elite has a 12-core CPU. Depending on the model, your Snapdragon X could have a 3.8 TFLOP GPU, or a 4.6 TFLOP GPU.\n\nThe big benefit of adding the Snapdragon X to the mix, at least in Microsoft's view, is the chip's NPU (neural processing unit), which is responsible for AI computing processes. Whether you get the Plus or the Elite, you get a 45 TOPS NPU (TOPS standard for trillions of operations per second), which Qualcomm says can run over 13 billion parameters on-device.\n\nIt's not just the chipset being pushed here, it's Windows 11 itself. Microsoft says it has rebuilt the OS' architecture around maximizing the CPU, GPU, and now, NPU. Now that the chips are Arm-based, they can run the ever growing list of Arm64-based apps. Microsoft naturally highlighted the apps in its own Microsoft 365 offering, including Teams, PowerPoint, Word, and Excel, but also apps like Chrome, Spotify, Zoom, and WhatsApp. Microsoft has also partnered with companies like Adobe (Photoshop, Lightroom and Express), and apps like DaVinci Resolve Studio and djay Pro.\n\nThey went after Apple explicitly: Microsoft says their Copilot+ PCs outperform the 15-inch MacBook Air by up to 58% in sustained multithreaded performance. They also did a live demo showing how a new Surface Laptop can process a Photoshop project faster than an M3 MacBook Air:\n\nGPT-4o and Copilot\n\nMicrosoft also announced that Copilot will soon have access to GPT-4o, OpenAI's latest and great LLM. As Microsoft is a major OpenAI investor, this is no surprise: The company added GPT-4 Turbo to Copilot as a free feature even before OpenAI thought it was cool to give the latest models away to users for free.\n\nMicrosoft showed off how this capability might be used. For example, using GPT-4o, you can supposedly enlist the help of AI as you navigate a video game. Here's a demo from the event, where Copilot (powered by GPT-4o) talks the demonstrator through a round of Minecraft:\n\nBetter on-device search through Recall\n\nRecall is a new Windows 11 feature for Copilot+ PCs that aims to improve the search experience on your computer. When you search for something with Recall, rather than see a list of files, folders, and apps, you see screenshots of related materials in a timeline. It's as if Microsoft has recorded all of the activity you do on your PC, and is using AI to pull up still images from apps that match the keywords in your query.\n\nRecall works for finding emails, photos, websites, and anything else you may have done or created on your computer. Microsoft says all snapshots are stored locally on your PC, so none of your activities are ever shared to the cloud or outside your machine.\n\nOh, and Microsoft is selling new Surface laptops too\n\nWhile many OEMs have new Copilot+ PC laptops in the offing, Microsoft announced two new Surface laptops as part of its rollout of the tech: Surface Laptop, and Surface Pro. Both machines run the Snapdragon X Elite and Plus chips, and so come with all the Copilot+ PC perks, but they differ in final design and execution.\n\nThe Surface Laptop has a new design with thinner bezels and a haptic touchpad, and comes in either a 13.8-inch display, or a 15-inch display, both with 120Hz refresh rates. Microsoft says this machine gets up to 20 hours of local video playback (not streaming, mind you) on the 13.8-inch, and 22 hours on the 15.8-inch, and supports Wi-Fi 7. As its name implies, this is a laptop, so while it has a touchscreen, it's not detachable. It's available for pre-order now, and starts at $999.99 (13.8-inch) and $1,299.99 (15-inch). If you want the Snapdragon X Elite on the 13.8-inch, that'll increase the price to $1,399.99, making it $100 more than the 15-inch that comes with the Elite already.\n\nIf you're looking for a machine with a detachable tablet, that's the Surface Pro. The latest 2-in-1 Surface comes in an optional 13-inch OLED configuration, with an ultrawide camera, two USB-4 ports, Wi-Fi 7, and support for outputting to up to three external 4K displays. Notably, you can actually replace many of the parts of the Surface Pro, including the motherboard, battery, and cameras. (What year is this?) Finally, the new Surface Flex Keyboard actually works while detached, so you don't need to physically connect it to the display in order to type.\n\nThis is a fascinating time for the personal computing market. While Microsoft has always brought together different OEMs under the same PC umbrella, they're now talking about these different machines as if they're all one family, the same way Apple always has. Microsoft didn't say the new Surfaces outperformed the MacBook; rather, they said the Copilot+ PCs as a whole do. They're standardizing the hardware and the software for this moment, to market their machines as the best on the market for power, efficiency, and AI.\n\nOf course, as with every new tech announcement, we won't really know how these machines hold up until reviewers start testing them in unbiased environments. Plus, next month, we should see a slew of new AI announcements from Apple at WWDC, so the situation is going to change fast.

The company also demonstrated its Copilot voice assistant acting as a real-time virtual coach to a user playing the \"Minecraft\" video game.\n\nYusuf Mehdi, who heads up consumer marketing for Microsoft, said the company expects that 50 million AI PCs will be purchased over the next year. At the press event, he said faster AI assistants that run directly on a PC will be \"the most compelling reason to upgrade your PC in a long time.\"\n\nTo be called a \"Copilot+\" PC, the machines must meet mininum standards of processing power and performance, meaning that they will likely sell for higher prices. Microsoft's new \"Copilot+\" computer marketing category that highlights AI features is reminiscent of the \"Ultrabook\" category of thin-form Windows laptops that Intel promoted with PC manufacturers in 2011 to compete against Apple's MacBook Air.\n\nMicrosoft executives also said that GPT-4o, the latest technology from OpenAI, will \"soon\" be available as part of Microsoft Copilot.\n\nMicrosoft also introduced a new generation of its own Surface Pro tablet and Surface Laptop that feature Qualcomm chips based on Arm Holdings' architecture. The company also introduced a technology called Prism that will help software written for Intel and AMD chips run on chips made with Arm technology.\n\nAfter Intel's processors dominated the personal computer market for decades, Qualcomm and other makers of lower-power Arm components have tried to compete in the Windows-PC market.\n\nThe Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chips include a so-called neural processing unit that is designed to accelerate AI-focused applications, such as Microsoft's Copilot software.\n\nMicrosoft held the product event a day before the start of its annual developer conference.\n\nMicrosoft aims to extend its early advantage in the race to produce AI tools that consumers are willing to pay for. Its partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI allowed it to jump ahead of Alphabet, as other Big Tech companies race to dominate the emerging field.\n\nLast week, OpenAI and Alphabet's Google showcased dueling AI technologies that can respond via voice in real time and be interrupted, both hallmarks of realistic voice conversations that AI voice assistants have found challenging. Google also announced it was rolling out several generative AI features to its lucrative search engine.\n\nThe PC industry has been under increasing pressure from Apple since the company launched its custom chips based on designs from Arm and ditched Intel's processors. The Apple-designed processors have given Mac computers superior battery life and speedier performance than rivals' chips that use more energy.\n\nMicrosoft tapped Qualcomm to lead the effort to move the Windows operating system to Arm's chip designs in 2016. Qualcomm has exclusivity on Microsoft Windows devices that expires this year. Other chip designers such as Nvidia have efforts under way to make their own Arm-based PC chips, Reuters has previously reported.\n\n(Reporting by Max A.

During an event at Microsoft's campus in Redmond, Washington, CEO Satya Nadella unveiled the Copilot+ PCs. These computers, developed in collaboration with manufacturers like Acer and Asustek Computer, align with Microsoft's stock prices reaching near all-time highs amid Wall Street's expectations that AI will significantly boost earnings for major tech firms.\n\nThese PCs are engineered to manage a greater share of AI tasks locally, reducing reliance on cloud data centres. Priced from $1,000, the devices are slated to begin shipping on June 18. The lineup includes laptops from established manufacturers such as Dell Technologies, HP, and Samsung Electronics, complemented by two models from Microsoft itself.\n\nTechnical innovations and product range\n\nThe Surface Laptop, Microsoft's inaugural Copilot+ device, features a Qualcomm Snapdragon X series system-on-chip. This chip includes a built-in AI accelerator capable of delivering up to 45 tera operations per second (TOPS) of computing power. Available in 13.5-inch and 15-inch models, these laptops offer up to 64 gigabytes of RAM and 1 terabyte of flash storage.\n\nJoining the Surface Laptop is the new Copilot+ version of the Surface Pro, a versatile two-in-one PC. This 10.6-inch tablet converts into a laptop with a detachable keyboard, known as the Flex Keyboard, which also functions as a wireless connector and stylus charger for the Surface Pro.\n\nBoth the Surface Laptop and Surface Pro are equipped with the Snapdragon X processor, available with up to 32 gigabytes of RAM and one terabyte of storage. The high-end models feature an OLED display, enhancing visual quality significantly.\n\nA distinctive feature of the Copilot+ series is \"Recall,\" which allows the device to log all user activities -- from web browsing to voice chats -- and store this data locally. This functionality creates a searchable history that users can access to revisit past activities, even months later.\n\nYusuf Mehdi, head of consumer marketing at Microsoft, announced at the press event that the company anticipates selling 50 million AI PCs in the coming year. He emphasised that the enhanced capabilities of AI assistants, now operating directly on these PCs, will make a compelling case for consumers considering upgrades.\n\nDespite a 15% decline in global PC shipments last year, according to Gartner, Microsoft is optimistic about the potential market share for its Copilot+ PCs.\n\nAnalyst Ben Bajarin from Creative Strategies remarked: \"People just need to be convinced that the device experience alone justifies this entirely new category of Copilot+ machines.\"\n\nEchoing Intel's 2011 strategy with the \"Ultrabook,\" which aimed to compete against Apple's MacBook Air, Microsoft's introduction of the \"Copilot+\" category is poised to redefine the slim-form Windows laptop market.\n\nMicrosoft also revealed that GPT-4o, the latest advancement from OpenAI's ChatGPT, will soon be integrated into Copilot. Additionally, the new series of Surface Pro tablets and Surface Laptops will incorporate Qualcomm chips based on Arm Holdings' designs, utilising the innovative Prism technology to adapt software originally designed for Intel and AMD processors for use on Arm-based systems.\n\nAt a recent demonstration, Microsoft showcased how its new devices, running Adobe photo editing software, outperformed an Apple device, just weeks after Apple introduced a new AI-focused chip expected to enhance future laptops.\n\nChallenges and opportunities in the evolving PC market\n\nFacing strong competition in the traditional PC market, Microsoft continues to lead in integrating the latest AI trends into consumer products. This strategic initiative, fueled by its partnership with OpenAI, aims to secure a leadership position in the fiercely competitive AI industry, challenging rivals like Alphabet.\n\nJust last week, both OpenAI and Alphabet's Google introduced new AI technologies that support real-time, voice-responsive interactions, establishing new benchmarks for AI voice assistants.

The Build event will further illustrate how AI will be embedded into Windows and the practical applications for PC users.\n\nCompetition and Collaborations\n\nBuild comes on the heels of Google I/O, where Google unveiled its most powerful AI model yet, Gemini AI, which promises to revolutionize how AI functions on computers and phones. Additionally, OpenAI, backed by Microsoft, recently introduced its GPT-4o model. Microsoft's Copilot technology, which is based on OpenAI's models, is set to be a major highlight at Build.\n\nHardware Partnerships: AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm\n\nTo support its AI ambitions, Microsoft relies on hardware partners like AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm. These companies provide the necessary chips for both online and offline AI tasks. A key innovation in AI PCs is the NPU, designed to handle AI tasks more efficiently than traditional CPUs. Qualcomm, with its Arm-based architecture, offers unique advantages in this space, including longer battery life and cellular connectivity.\n\nThe Role of Neural Processing Units (NPUs)\n\nNPUs are crucial for AI PCs, providing the power needed to perform complex AI tasks without an internet connection. Traditionally used by companies like Apple for photo and video enhancement, NPUs are now being integrated into PCs to handle a variety of AI applications, from speech recognition to real-time data processing.\n\nQualcomm's Arm-Based Architecture\n\nOne of the sessions at Build will focus on \"The Next Generation of Windows on Arm,\" exploring how Windows operates on Qualcomm chips compared to Intel and AMD versions. This session will likely address the performance improvements and new capabilities enabled by Qualcomm's Snapdragon X platform.\n\nWhile Microsoft has yet to detail the full offline capabilities of its AI PCs, comparisons can be made to Google's Pixel 8 Pro phone, which uses Gemini Nano AI to perform tasks like summarizing and transcribing recordings without a full computer processor. This suggests that similar functionalities could be available on Windows AI PCs.\n\nThe Future of Arm-Based PCs\n\nQualcomm has long promoted its Arm-based computers for their benefits like extended battery life and sleek designs. Despite initial limitations, such as the inability of the Snapdragon 835 chip to run most Windows applications, Microsoft has since optimized Windows for Arm, improving compatibility and performance. However, challenges remain, as indicated by Microsoft's dedicated FAQ page for ARM-based computers.\n\nBuild will host a session titled \"AI Everywhere,\" focusing on accelerating generative AI models on cloud-connected devices. This session will provide insights into how developers can harness AI to enhance their applications and services.\n\nAzure AI Studio\n\nAnother key session, \"Azure AI Studio,\" will explore how developers can create their own Copilot chatbots. This initiative aligns with efforts by Google and OpenAI to democratize AI, allowing businesses to develop custom AI solutions, such as chatbots that assist employees with selecting health benefits.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Technical Analysis\n\nThe current price is above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating a bullish trend.

Microsoft also introduced two offerings of its own as part of the Surface lineup. It's worth noting that laptops with Intel and AMD processors will also offer these AI features, in addition to Microsoft's lineup of laptops that include processors based on the Arm architecture, with Qualcomm's Snapdragon\n\nThe AI capabilities of Copilot Plus computers are powered by the integrated NPU. One of the key features of Windows 11 is Recall, which uses artificial intelligence to create a searchable \"photographic memory\" of everything the user has done and seen on their computer. These laptops will run more than 40 AI models within Windows 11 to support new features. In addition, Microsoft Copilot's built-in AI assistant will gain support for OpenAI's GPT-4 model.\n\nAccording to Youssef Mahdi, the Microsoft executive who oversees Windows, the new laptops will be 58% faster than a MacBook Air with an M3 processor and provide all-day battery life. However, it is still unclear whether this applies to all Copilot Plus PC laptops or only those with Qualcomm processors based on the Arm architecture, which seems to be the most likely scenario. Microsoft expects to sell 50 million laptops under the Copilot Plus PC brand next year.\n\nTo ensure optimal performance, Copilot Plus computers will have specific minimum requirements, including 16GB of RAM, 256GB of SSD storage, and an integrated Neural Processor (NPU). Models based on Arm processors, such as Qualcomm chipsets, are expected to provide autonomy that supports up to 15 hours of web browsing.\n\nMicrosoft is pitching these devices as the beginning of a new era for Windows laptops, with the potential to truly change the way we manage computers. The shift to chips based on the Arm architecture and the integration of AI features into the hardware accompanying the processor are two important bets on hardware and software that have not yet been tested in real conditions.\n\nThe first Copilot Plus computers will be available on June 18, with Qualcomm processors, while models with Intel and AMD processors will be released at a later date. More about the capabilities of Copilot PCs, as well as the presence of a specialized key on the keyboard, we are expected to learn from tomorrow when the Microsoft Build conference opens its doors.", "source": {"uri": "thevalleypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Valley Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chipset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solid-state drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer keyboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn-bb-eu1.insomnia.gr/file/insomnia-s3/monthly_2024_05/copilot.jpeg.7c2a9ea964e898c983b6b621f3b96114.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 2405, "textEnd": 2412}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

If you remember people discussing \"Windows 12\" in the past, Copilot+ is what they meant; it's just that Microsoft decided to stick with the Windows 11 branding rather than hop to Windows 12. A Copilot+ PC is designed to run Microsoft's AI services locally without needing to send anything to an external server. This does mean that Copilot will run on-device with a Copilot+ computer, but Microsoft also demoed other AI tools, such as the Recall feature that remembers what you did in the past so you don't have to.\n\nAs you might expect, the best way to experience these AI models is to see them in action. If you're interested in Microsoft's new additions to Windows 11, give the keynote video a watch and see what parts stand out for you. And if you just want details on the new Copilot+ PCs, you can check out Lenovo's, Samsung's, Acer's, and Asus's offerings you can use with this new version of Windows.", "source": {"uri": "xda-developers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "XDA-Developers"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/05/surface-pro-surface-laptop-5.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Ostensibly, \"AI\" is the unifying element, but as expected, it feels just as much like they're going right after Apple with some new Surface machines and the new Qualcomm chips inside. What's slightly weird about this event is that it wasn't live-streamed, so you have to rely on live-blogs (and posts) from the various players who are there. Just like the old days!\n\nIf I'm following along correctly, the Surface Pro is Microsoft's would-be iPad Pro-killer. What it lacks in thin, it seems to make up for in functioning like an actual computer. As we all know after the last week or so, some people don't want a tablet that can also be a laptop. But some people do. And Microsoft has clearly been doing a better job positioning on this purpose than Apple has to date. The issue holding Microsoft's devices back have been their chips. They're saying that changes today. Obviously, we'll have to see it to believe it. The devices look good though - being able to used the keyboard while detached is a nice... um, touch.\n\nSurface Laptop is Microsoft's would-be MacBook Air-killer. But same general idea: the chips have been holding it back - in this product's case, Intel's. Now they're going with Qualcomm too and touting performance and yes, battery life. Again, we'll see. It is humorous how the device has the wedge design, which the MacBook Air made famous, but has since moved away from (unless you shop at Walmart). And yes, it has a fucking touchscreen.\n\nThese (and more) are what Microsoft is now calling 'Copilot+ PCs' which feels very Microsoft. The 'Copilot' branding has been a good one, but to me, it felt better as a part of the Office suite. Microsoft clearly wants to use it for all AI-related things, and I honestly just wish they would use 'Microsoft AI' or 'Windows AI'. Still, fine 'Copilot' sure - but 'Copilot+'? Has the streaming shitshow taught us nothing? 'Copilot+ PCs'? Has the last 40 years of Microsoft branding taught us nothing? Anyway, what does a 'Copilot+ PC' mean? Here's Kris Holt:\n\nTo be dubbed a Copilot+ PC, a system will need to deliver at least 40 TOPs (tera operations per second) of NPU performance and have at least 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.\n\nAnd Microsoft has created this spec requirement because they're not the only ones releasing 'Copilot+ PCs'. There's Acer, Dell, HP, and Lenovo, oh my. The fact that all of these top PC makers signed up for this speaks to both Microsoft's continued clout - obviously, what other OS are they going to run? ChromeOS, I guess? - and perhaps to the performance claims that Qualcomm is making here. Again, we'll see soon enough. But it's pretty impressive coordination.\n\nLastly, there's a lot of buzz around Recall, a feature being baked into Windows which, yes, will allow you to quickly call back to anything you were doing on your PC, with AI powering the search, capture, and natural language capabilities. This is exactly what I thought Microsoft would and should be doing. And yes, it's what Rewind (now called Limitless) has been doing on the Mac. Other companies have tried this type of thing before - including Microsoft, previously - but this is a very obvious and clear use case for AI. So much so that I'd be pretty surprised if Apple doesn't offer something very similar at WWDC in a few weeks. Perhaps the most surprising element here though is that 'Recall' is good branding! I half can't believe this isn't 'Copilot+ Windows Remembrance Backup Plus Storage for Pros NT 25'.\n\nSo is Windows back? I mean probably not in some way that profoundly changes the PC market as it stands right now. But they seemingly now have a credible answer to the MacBook Air and iPad Pro - and specifically, Apple Silicon - thanks to Qualcomm's silicon. I'll remain slightly skeptical of that until we actually see third-party tests and more importantly, hear about real world tests. But clearly the entire PC industry is behind this being some kind of new era. Or if nothing else, an easy new marketing angle.\n\nSort of fun to see what The Verge has created for liveblogging in 2024. It's sort of like their own Twitter!\n\nThis way of doing things obviously force-filters coverage through a lens and it's sort of weird that Microsoft wouldn't want the free publicity associated with people being to watch (and post about) a live event. Then again, maybe they're going for an aura of exclusivity around the event. Still weird in 2024!", "source": {"uri": "spyglass.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spyglass"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surface Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacBook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer keyboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surface Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchscreen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walmart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChromeOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChromeOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_silicon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple silicon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windows NT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://spyglass.org/content/images/size/w1200/2024/05/RW1iUuD.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

These PCs are designed to handle more AI tasks locally, thanks to powerful hardware that includes dedicated neural processing units (NPUs) capable of at least 45 trillion operations per second (TOPS).\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella introduced the Copilot+ PCs, calling them \"the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever built.\" The company has partnered with major PC manufacturers like Dell, HP, Lenovo, Acer, ASUS, and Samsung, as well as chipmakers Qualcomm, Intel, and AMD to bring these devices to market.The first wave of Copilot+ PCs will be powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon X series chips and are launching on June 18, with prices starting at $999 (around 80,000).\n\nCopilot+ PCs will feature a range of new AI experiences, including \"Recall,\" which allows users to find files and data using natural language prompts, and an enhanced version of Microsoft's AI assistant, Copilot,, that will support OpenAI's GPT-4o model. The company says that this is made possible by including over 40 AI models in a new Windows 11 layer that is deeply integrated with the hardware.\n\nMicrosoft is also touting improved performance and battery life for Copilot+ PCs, claiming they are up to 58% faster than Apple's MacBook Air with an M3 processor and can deliver up to 22 hours of local video playback or 15 hours of web browsing on a single charge. To achieve the Copilot+ designation, PCs must have at least 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage in addition to the dedicated NPU.\n\nAs part of the push for Copilot+ PCs, Microsoft has rebuilt Windows 11 for Arm-based chips and developed an emulator called Prism to ensure compatibility with older apps.\n\nMicrosoft has been trying to make Arm-based Windows PCs a success for some time, and the introduction of Copilot+ PCs comes as a crucial step for the Redmond giant in that direction.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abhinav_kaustubh@timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "name": "Abhinav Kaustubh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emulator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110281289,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-910363,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 962, "textEnd": 969}], "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

If the Internet remembers, apparently your PC will too. Cocreator is an art or image generation assistant, while Live Captions does pretty much what you'd expect, generating captions in real time. Hopefully they're better than some of the rubbish YouTube can serve up.\n\n\"Copilot+ PCs powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Series deliver performance per watt leadership to the Windows ecosystem while also powering groundbreaking AI experiences and exceptional battery life\" said Pavan Davuluri, Corporate Vice President, Windows + Devices for Microsoft. \"This is an inflection point for the Windows PC ecosystem, enabled by our deep partnership with Qualcomm. I am thrilled to be able to launch innovative Copilot+ PCs experiences and devices with Snapdragon, including Surface, that have leading performance and energy efficiency.\"\n\nFor now, only Snapdragon X processors offer enough performance to qualify as Copilot+ PCs. Intel and AMD's currently available NPU equipped chips don't meet this threshold, though both companies will introduce faster models later in the year.\n\nMicrosoft unveiled its new Surface family today, equipped with Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus processors. They promise competitive performance and genuine all-day battery life, so if you're one of the many yet to be captivated by AI, they look like quality laptops in their own right. They'll have MacBooks directly in their crosshairs.\n\nCopilot+ will be supported by Adobe, DaVinci Resolve, CapCut and djay Pro among others. Microsoft says more announcements will follow.\n\nThe first Copilot+ PCs are available for pre-order from today, with availability from June 18. Other companies including Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung will also offer Copilot+ PCs. We can expect to see most of these at Computex in less than two weeks from now.\n\nMay I just sign off by wondering if this ecosystem will benefit gamers? I've heard mentions of things like adaptive boss fights and smarter multiplayer bots and enemies, but that goes back as far as the launch of Nvidia's Tensor cores back in 2018. Google has developed a co-op AI Agent, but it's still in the research phase.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see if, or how game developers make use of NPUs, as such processors are on their way to becoming ubiquitous.", "source": {"uri": "pcgamer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pcgamer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_szewczyk@pcgamer.com", "name": "Chris Szewczyk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_per_watt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Performance per watt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Efficient energy use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cooperative video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boss (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DaVinci_Resolve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DaVinci Resolve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x4jBg8VRZtGw6h8TPAyAW9-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 2471, "textEnd": 2478}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

These PCs will include the Copilot key on the keyboard to activate Microsoft's generative AI assistant as unveiled by the company earlier this year.\n\nThe Copilot+ PCs employ a new system architecture that integrates the CPU, GPU, and a high-performance Neural Processing Unit (NPU). This design allows the PCs to run AI models up to 20 times more powerful than earlier models, with 100 times the efficiency, as much as 58% better performance than the Apple MacBook Air 15\", according to Microsoft. The PCs include both large language models (LLMs) in the Azure Cloud and small language models (SLMs) running locally. Microsoft's Copilot generative AI assistant is baked into the system. The virtual is already available on devices running Windows 11, but the new computers offer access through the Copilot key on keyboards.\n\n\"This first wave of Copilot+ PCs is just the beginning. Over the past year, we have seen an incredible pace of innovation of AI in the cloud with Copilot allowing us to do things that we never dreamed possible. Now, we begin a new chapter with AI innovation on the device. We have completely reimagined the entirety of the PC - from silicon to the operating system, the application layer to the cloud - with AI at the center, marking the most significant change to the Window platform in decades,\" Microsoft consumer CMO Yusuf Mehdi said. \"Copilot will now have the full application experience customers have been asking for in a streamlined, simple yet powerful and personal design. Copilot puts the most advanced AI models at your fingertips. In the coming weeks, get access to the latest models including GPT-4o from our partners at OpenAI, so you can have voice conversations that feel more natural.\"\n\nThe inclusion of most of the latest commercially available models is likely going to be a big selling point. The fact that it extends to voice control does evoke Microsoft's decommissioned Cortana voice assistant, however. Even though the company never mentions the defunct product. Windows has been incorporating Copilot features for months now. The generative AI tool is multimodal and has a search function already embedded in the taskbar.\n\nCopilot+ PCs also come with several other generative AI-driven features aimed at improving productivity and creativity. For instance, Recall addresses the common problem of locating previously viewed content. Recall organizes information based on user-specific relationships and associations, enabling quick and intuitive access to files, websites, and emails. There's also the Cocreator tool for image creation and editing. Users can generate and refine images in near real-time using natural language prompts and ink strokes. For photos, the new Restyle Image tool allows users to reimagine their photos with new styles, while the Live Captions feature now includes live translations, converting any audio into English-language captions in real time. This function supports over 40 languages. Microsoft has begun pre-sales of the Copilot+ PCs, which start at $1,000. The computers become available on June 18.\n\nFollow @voicebotaiFollow @erichschwartz\n\nMicrosoft Augments Copilot Generative AI with Plugins and Computer Control\n\nMicrosoft Unveils New Generative AI Features for Copilot 365 With Report Showing Everyone is Using AI at Work", "source": {"uri": "voicebot.ai", "dataType": "news", "title": "Voicebot.ai"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_hal_schwartz@voicebot.ai", "name": "Eric Hal Schwartz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer keyboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortana_(virtual_assistant)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cortana (virtual assistant)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://voicebot.ai/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/microsoft-copilot-plus-pc.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 3332, "textEnd": 3339}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Recall tracks everything done on the computer, from web browsing to voice chats, creating a history stored on the computer that the user can search when they need to remember something they did, even months later.\n\nThe company also demonstrated its Copilot voice assistant acting as a real-time virtual coach to a user playing the Minecraft video game.\n\nYusuf Mehdi, who heads up consumer marketing for Microsoft, said the company expects that 50 million AI PCs will be purchased over the next year.\n\nAt the press event, Mehdi said faster AI assistants that run directly on a PC will be \"the most compelling reason to upgrade your PC in a long time.\"\n\nGlobal PC shipments dipped about 15 per cent to 242 million last year, according to research firm Gartner, which suggests Microsoft expects the new category of computers to account for around one-fifth of all PCs sold.\n\n\"People just need to be convinced that the device experience alone justifies this entirely new category of Copilot+ machines,\" said analyst Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies.\n\nMicrosoft's new Copilot+ computer marketing category that highlights AI features is reminiscent of the Ultrabook category of thin-form Windows laptops that Intel promoted with PC manufacturers in 2011 to compete against Apple's MacBook Air.\n\nMicrosoft executives also said that GPT-4o, the latest technology from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, will \"soon\" be available as part of Copilot.\n\nMicrosoft also introduced a new generation of its own Surface Pro tablet and Surface Laptop that feature Qualcomm chips based on Arm Holdings' architecture. It also introduced a technology called Prism that will help software written for Intel and AMD chips run on chips made with Arm technology.\n\nMicrosoft showed its new devices in action against an Apple device, showing photo editing software from Adobe running faster on the Microsoft device.

In a year when \"AI\" is tacked on to every tech product imaginable, what have been called AI PCs so far just haven't felt worthy of the designation.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nBut Microsoft's announcement today dares to take the concept of the AI PC seriously. Microsoft calls them \"Copilot+ PCs,\" a new breed of laptop that has been completely reengineered to support ARM processors for the purpose of running persistent AI models at all times. You might not be as enthusiastic about AI as Microsoft seems to be, but there's no question: this is one of the biggest PC announcements in decades.\n\nNew AI superpowers\n\nA lot has been made of the presence of neural processing units (NPUs) in the latest generation of Windows laptops, but there's a problem: right now, they don't have anything to do outside of background blur in video calls. Part of the problem is a lack of performance in the current generation, yes, but Microsoft says it's also due to how the entire system has been architected. At its core, Copilot+ resolves this problem by reengineering Windows 11 all around the experience of AI -- specifically by running a series of always-on, on-device small language models in the background.\n\n\"We had to make extensions in our driver compute model to be able to have the NPU show up as a first-class citizen, a true third processor inside the operating system,\" said by Pavan Davuluri, the lead of the Windows and Devices team, to a group of media. \"We had to do work to be able to add new AI APIs in the platform. We had new OS primitives that are powered by always-on running models inside the device.\"\n\nTo start off, Microsoft is offering two specific use cases of AI built right into Windows. The first feature is the more controversial one, which is called Recall. In a sense, it's a redesigned view of search -- if you want to think of it that way. Using the timeline you can look through everything you've done on your computer, and using the PC's small language models, can help you find things using natural language. That might be an item you mentioned in Discord chat or line of text in a Powerpoint presentation you're working on.\n\nMicrosoft says these PCs should be thought of more accurately as \"a sensor for AI\" now.\n\n\"Imagine now this new systems architecture we're talking about can actually understand in real time everything you're doing on the PC, that it can create a semantic index of what's happening,\" Yusuf Mehdi, executive vice president at Microsoft, told us in the same briefing. \"Suddenly now, your ability to not only find something, but to even recall it is now possible, and that becomes a superpower.\"\n\nTo achieve this, of course, you're giving enormous amounts of data to the AI in your computer. According to Microsoft, Recall is private, local, and secure, and guarantees that this information won't be used to train AI models. Furthermore, you can go in and edit this available freely, blacklisting certain apps or websites as desired.\n\nIn fact, Microsoft says these PCs should be thought of more accurately as \"a sensor for AI\" now. That's exactly the kind of terminology that excites some and terrifies others. Still, there's an obvious privacy concern with the idea of your PC recording and knowing everything you do on your PC -- yet Microsoft seems convinced that it'll be a hit once people try it.\n\nThe other big AI features revolve around some more familiar ideas in how we currently use AI -- creation. As described by Mehdi, we're already all using AI for text and image creation, all currently powered by the cloud. But there are some problems with this approach, according to Microsoft.\n\n\"Number one, it's very expensive. I can tell you that because we pay for all these GPUs here at Microsoft,\" Mehdi says, laughing. \"The second thing is the latency. Sometimes it's fast, but sometimes you're waiting, you're waiting. You go up to the server; the servers are full. That's a problem.\"\n\nFaster and cheaper (for Microsoft) models are one thing. But Microsoft imagines these on-device AI models opening up entirely new experiences in the realm of AI creation. In particular, Microsoft previewed a brand-new Photos app, with DALL-E level image generation built right in, allowing you to create and edit your photos all with natural language. As Microsoft notes, that doesn't involve tokens or logins -- it's all completed on-device.\n\n\"It's good, but imagine now you have local models, AI models, that are now increasingly powerful, and they're powered by very fast and performant NPUs, but they're on the local device,\" Mehdi explains. \"Now, that creation gets unlocked. And imagine you take advantage of what we will do with the PC, where we have pen and touch, and you can really get in it. Suddenly, the ability to create can maybe leap to a new level.\"\n\nThat might sound vague, but we have to learn on what Microsoft has been developing. And as expected, we're already seeing that laptop manufacturers such as Lenovo and HP are building their own AI software on top of Microsoft's features. This is really only the beginning. Microsoft also showed off a feature in Paint called Cocreator, real-time translation, Copilot recommendations in settings, reply to message notifications with one click, and much more.\n\nThese are software experiences that just wouldn't be possible for non-Copilot+ laptops without tanking battery life. In fact, apart from a new full-screen version of Copilot, these are features that are exclusive to the Copilot+ device lineup. That's why Qualcomm's ARM chips are key to making this whole transition really work. And for the first time, both Qualcomm and Microsoft appear to be holding up both sides of the deal.\n\nARM makes it all possible\n\nAs if the AI revolution wasn't enough, these Copilot+ laptops had an even larger challenge to overcome. Infamously, Microsoft has made multiple attempts to fully support Windows on ARM, whether it was the original Windows 8 transition or the Surface Pro X. But these new Qualcomm chips make the leap ahead in performance that was needed to convince both Microsoft and laptop manufacturers that it's the real deal.\n\nBut as Microsoft has learned the hard way, sticking some ARM chips into an ecosystem that isn't ready for it only makes things worse. To make it work, Microsoft has had to redesign its entire stack to be ARM-capable.\n\n\"We engineered this update of Windows 11 with the real focus on AI inference and taking advantage of the ARM64 instruction set at every layer of the operating system stack,\" says Davuluri.\n\nAll of that adds up to something akin to an M1 moment for the Windows platform.\n\nThis is no minor update to Windows -- everything has been redesigned from the ground up. There's a new compiler, kernel, and schedulers -- all tuned to the individual chip itself to optimize CPU performance. There's even improved memory management to balance the extra load that always-on AI models add.\n\nBeyond the hardware itself, there's been a Herculean effort to bring first-party and third-party apps up to date too. After all, all the performance in the world doesn't matter if the apps themselves aren't optimized for the hardware. Microsoft says it worked with over 300 software vendors (both consumer and commercial) to rebuild their apps natively to ARM.\n\n\"We've made tremendous progress in building that platform, so much so that I think when you look at our data today for Copilot+ PC customers, we're fairly confident 90% of their application minutes of use will be native on ARM,\" Davuluri said. \"That was a key goal for us, and I think we're there.\"\n\nMicrosoft points to plenty of important apps that have been compiled to run natively on ARM, including Zoom, Dropbox, Netflix, Lightroom, Fresca, CPU-Z, and Firefox -- just to list a few. There are some notable apps missing, of course, whether it's Adobe Acrobat, Discord, or Slack. For those missing apps, Microsoft has also built a new emulator for running x86 apps called Prism in Windows 11. The company claims that the efficiency of Prism is 20% gen-on-gen, resulting in performance in these apps equivalent to the most recent Surface Laptop 5.\n\n\"That new Prism emulator, combined with the sheer improvement in raw CPU performance, takes us to a place where we have great app experiences, great experiences across the entire breadth of the Windows catalog, whether they're native or emulated for us,\" Davuluri added. \"That's something we're pretty excited about.\"\n\nOf course, emulation doesn't work equally across applications, and all of this needs to be experienced firsthand, but this certainly seems to be akin to what Apple did with Rosetta 2 in its own transition to ARM.\n\nWelcome to the Copilot+ era\n\nWhile the transition to ARM has been many years in the making, the focus on AI shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. Over the past year, we've witnessed Microsoft embrace AI with reckless abandon, along with many of the biggest players in the game. By 2024, it's already become central to everything the company is doing moving forward. But the Copilot Plus PC program takes things to another level. Microsoft wants this to be the beginning of a reset on what the PC is, and Copilot Plus is a way of kicking things off.\n\nThe new software features are neat, but Copilot Plus PCs will need to meet a fairly tight list of hardware specifications, with a powerful NPU being the most significant one. All Copilot Plus PCs require an NPU capable of 40 TOPS, a standard that outpaces not only the current selection of Intel and AMD chips, but also Apple's most recent M4. They'll also need 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, but the NPU is really the clincher here.\n\n\"We have been working with the broad industry, silicon providers, [manufacturers], software developers, developers of all kinds, and we've been on this journey,\" Mehdi told us. \"We've started with Qualcomm.\"\n\nMicrosoft has been working with Qualcomm for years, but the Snapdragon X Elite is unlike any chip the company has made yet. Using a variety of AI benchmarks, Microsoft was quick to show off just how much AI performance these NPUs are capable of -- specifically at very low wattages. That's true in terms of raw CPU performance too.\n\nAll of that adds up to something akin to an M1 moment for the Windows platform.\n\n\"Number one, they will be the fastest, most performant PCs on the market by a very large margin,\" Mehdi claimed about Copilot+ PCs. \"You take the fastest, most performing PC out there, let's say it's a MacBook Air with an M3 processor. These PCs will outperform that by 50% on the Cinebench benchmark.\"\n\nWe got to see some of that performance firsthand at the Microsoft labs, proving that these benchmarks are for real. Testing the new Surface Laptop side by side against the MacBook Air, the Surface does indeed pass the MacBook Air in terms of multi-core performance across multiple benchmarks and applications.\n\nNow, this first wave of Copilot Plus devices will all be built on the same Snapdragon X Elite chips. In the future, laptops with other chips may also qualify, such as the devices launching with Intel Lunar Lake. But Qualcomm has an exclusivity on it for now -- at least when it comes to laptops you can actually go out and buy.\n\nAll of that adds up to something akin to an M1 moment for the Windows platform. We don't know for sure that Microsoft's attempt will stick -- and with an ecosystem this broad, it's bound to be messier than with Apple. The adoption of AI at this level certainly throws a wrench into things, and how the public reacts feels like a moving target.\n\nI'll be the first to admit that it felt like Microsoft needed a miracle to to embrace both AI and ARM in one fell swoop.. It's been a long time since we've seen Microsoft act this boldly, stepping up to lead the entire ecosystem toward a common goal. And from the looks of it so far, Microsoft just may have pulled off the impossible.\n\nSo, yes, with Copilot+, the term \"AI PC\" is no longer just marketing jargon. If the phrase \"AI PC\" has ever been meaningful, Copilot+ PCs will have certainly earned the badge. Whether that's a net positive in your book, though, I'll leave for you to decide.\n\nEditors' Recommendations The new Copilot+ Surface Laptop and Surface Pro look incredible The 5 best things you can do with Copilot Pro right now Microsoft says 75% of office workers already use AI at work Copilot is slowly pushing more AI into your Teams calls and chats 'Take this as a threat' -- Copilot is getting unhinged again", "source": {"uri": "digitaltrends.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Trends"}, "authors": [{"uri": "luke_larsen@digitaltrends.com", "name": "Luke Larsen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ARM architecture family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Videotelephony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emulator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft PowerPoint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semantics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Application software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slack_(software)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slack (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firefox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office_Suites", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office Suites", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/copilot-PC-announcement.jpg?resize=800%2C418&p=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

It showed off a gaming feature of Copilot, which is designed to assist players in certain Xbox and PC games.\n\nAccording to the Microsoft's X (formerly Twitter) post, Copilot uses natural language conversations to guide players when they get stuck or need information. At a demonstration, Copilot was used within Minecraft. A player asked Copilot how to craft a sword, and Copilot was able to explain the process and even direct the player to the necessary resources.\n\nCopilot could be a big help for gamers who sometimes get frustrated when they don't know how to progress in a game. Instead of searching online guides, Copilot allows for quick conversations right within the game.\n\nHowever, one of the most criticized behaviors of AI-powered chatbots is hallucination. This occurs when the AI confidently provides an answer to a question, but the information presented is factually incorrect. This means that Copilot can 'hallucinate' in games and mislead the player.\n\nThe company anticipates selling approximately 50 million laptops with the new Copilot+ PC label. To support this, Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm will be providing processors equipped with AI-powered chips designed for Windows and its Copilot assistant. Major PC companies such as Dell, HP, Acer, Asus, Samsung, and Lenovo, will be making Copilot+ PCs.\n\nMicrosoft also announced updated versions of its Surface Laptop and Surface Pro with all-new Snapdragon X processors.

application layer to the cloud, with AI at the center, marking the most significant change to the Window platform in decades.\"\n\nThe company also confirmed that it was working with many of its third-party hardware partners, including Acer, Dell, Lenovo and Samsung, would launch Copilot+ PCs.\n\nMicrosoft's announcement comes almost a week after Google laid out its plans to further embed AI in its products over the months to come, including rebuilding its search engine around AI-generated responses, and bringing its own generative AI assistant, Gemini, to more of its most popular apps.\n\nNext month, fellow industry heavyweight Apple is expected to lay out its own AI plans when it holds its annual developer conference, WWDC, at its Cupertino headquarters.\n\nIndustry expert Geoff Blaber, chief executive of analyst firm CCS Insight said the range of announcements showed Microsoft's \"determination\" to a key player in the AI space.\n\n\"Microsoft has identified an opportunity to re-energise the PC market, transform the user experience and has galvanised the PC ecosystem to support its vision,\" he said.\n\n\"If the market needs evidence of Microsoft's determination and drive under Satya Nadella or its commitment to lead in generative AI, Copilot+ is a further proof point.\"\n\n\"Microsoft's efforts to mobilise the ecosystem of manufacturers, silicon partners and developers is impressive and gives Copilot+ credibility at launch.\n\n\"However, success requires Microsoft to overcome several challenges not least, communication to consumers of what a Copilot+ PC is and what it enables that is unique and worth paying a premium for.\"", "source": {"uri": "expressandstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Express & Star"}, "authors": [],

On Monday, Microsoft announced the next step in the AI PC's evolution: the Copilot+ PC, and announced AI-powered Windows 11 features like Recall.\n\n\"The pursuit has always been about how to build computers that understand us, instead of having us having to understand computers, and I feel like we really are close to that breakthrough,\" said Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, in a briefing with reporters on Microsoft's campus.\n\nA Copilot+ PC combines local, on-device AI with cloud AI, according to Microsoft, to provide a range of services. Some of the new laptops shipping with the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus processors will be classified as Copilot+ PCs, taking advantage of the NPU found within both chips. That NPU will power local AI functions, with over 45 TOPS (trillions of operations per second) driving the AI engine.\n\nMicrosoft's Yusef Mehdi showed Copilot interacting with Photos, Settings, and even Minecraft, where Copilot actually talked to the user, recognizing what it saw on the screen. \"It really will be a whole new way of experiencing the world,\" Mehdi said.\n\nMicrosoft is orienting many of its apps and services around AI, and its Copilot brand. Of course, consumers will be able to tap the special Copilot key to launch Copilot, which is still a cloud-based AI service. But Windows will also include new AI powered features, too:\n\nRecall: This is what some referred to as \"AI Explorer,\" a feature that Microsoft seems to be aiming at certain PCs with powerful NPUs like the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite and Plus. Recall allows users to find anything on their PC just by describing it. The idea is that you'll be able to scroll back to find apps, documents, or messages that may have become lost or misplaced. Recall appears to be an updated, AI-powered version of Timeline, the 2018 organizational tool that Microsoft scrapped in 2021.\n\nCarolina Hernandez, a product manager at Microsoft, showed how she was chatting with her grandmother about a blue dress she had found on Pinterest. Recall allowed her to scroll back in time, find the chat, and the link. She did the same on a project creating a marketing deck.\n\nRecall is private, with small language models running directly on your device. It's designed to be private, and you can exclude documents and websites from Recall's eyes.\n\nSome of the other tools you may have seen before.\n\nLive Captions, first introduced in the Windows 11 2022 Update, is a nifty, if rather unpolished tool to apply captions to any source of video playing on your PC: from YouTube (which has its own captioning capabilities) to just a digitized video of your high-school graduation that you have stored on your PC.\n\nExpect Microsoft to beef up Live Captions' capabilities with additional features over time, including live translations back and forth between foreign languages.\n\nCocreator, part of Microsoft Paint, was added in the fall of 2023. Cocreator is a simple version of AI art: Tell Cocreator what to draw, and it will. Cocreator feels a little simpler than, say, Stable Diffusion, as it's handy for editing a scene or adding AI-generated objects or backgrounds.\n\nAutomatic Super Resolution is a technology that automatically upscales graphics and video, adding detail that might not have been there. I used it for games, but Microsoft announced it as an automatic video upscaler in Edge. Video Super Resolution works on machines with Nvidia GeForce RTX 20-series cards or newer, or AMD Radeon RX 5700 cards or newer. Microsoft was testing it in the \"Canary\" beta builds of Microsoft Edge, but it will graduate to the stable version of Edge soon.\n\nSuper Resolution is coming to the Photos app to upscale your photos.\n\nWindows Studio Effects is probably familiar to you. I first encountered Windows Studio Effects a year ago with the Microsoft Surface Pro 9 (5G), an Arm-powered laptop with the software installed. Right now, Microsoft limits it to laptops with NPUs installed, since the effects (background blur, noise filtering, and a slightly creepy technology that makes it seem like you're always looking at the camera) depends upon AI.\n\nMicrosoft appears to be beefing up Windows Studio Effects with additional filters.\n\nMicrosoft even showed off Copilot interacting with Xbox games (presumably the Xbox app). The demo showed off a way to actually ask Copilot what card to play in Solitaire, or what to do in Sea of Thieves.

Yet, personal computers -- most notably Windows-based laptops -- are about to be made over in a significant way thanks to the debut of a new category that Microsoft and major PC partners are calling Copilot+ PCs.\n\nCopilot+ PCs are next generation AI PCs that combine a new set of hardware capabilities along with a new version of Windows to deliver new experiences to PC users of all types. Given all the intense focus on AI these days, it's probably not surprising to hear that one of the core advancements of Copilot+ PCs is improved performance for applications and services that use artificial intelligence.\n\nFor example, a new feature called Recall, in the special version of Windows that Microsoft is releasing as part of this announcement, essentially gives your PC an all-encompassing digital memory.\n\nRecall allows you to search or scroll back through any document, Zoom call, email, or other work you did on your machine in a much more effective manner than you can do with traditional search functions.\n\nRemember interacting with a colleague or family member about an upcoming trip but can't remember exactly when or where it happened? Recall can help you find where the reference occurred and gives you the exact context for when it happened.\n\nBut that's not the only benefit. The first generation of these new Copilot+ laptops are based on a chip architecture from Arm (the same company that provides the underlying technology for the M-series chips that power today's MacBook Pro and MacBook Air), and these chips are built by Qualcomm.\n\nArm-based designs, which power virtually every smartphone in the world, are known for lower power usage than the typical x86-based chips from companies like Intel and AMD. That means they're able to drive the kind of super slim designs, long battery life, and impressive performance that have made modern Macs a popular choice for many.\n\nHowever, given the active participation of all the major vendors in this industry-wide effort, including Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung, Acer, Asus and Microsoft (via its Surface line), Windows users will have significantly more choices in designs and configurations than are ever offered by Apple.\n\nPlus, one of the key differentiators of the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips that are at the heart of these new designs is that they include a new component called a Neural Processing Unit (NPU). The NPU, which is best understood as an AI accelerator, is a new component for PCs that is specifically designed to perform certain types of tasks much faster and more power efficiently than they would run on just the main processor or graphics chip alone.\n\nIt's this new NPU that enables features like the previously mentioned Recall, for example. It can also be used to improve the performance and power efficiency of videoconferencing applications, content creation tools, gaming resolution and more. Most intriguingly, it offers the ability to run some generative AI-powered applications like automatic text and image generation directly on the PC without needing an internet connection.\n\nNow, to be clear, popular AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, and many more will continue to require an internet connection, and several of these won't see much (if any) initial benefit from Copilot+ PCs.\n\nGoogle search changes: Google all in on AI and Gemini: How it will affect your Google searches\n\nHowever, as these tools and web-based services mature and the number of Copilot+ PCs in people's hands increases, the expectation is that companies will take advantage of the advanced processing power that these new NPUs will enable. In other words, you'll be getting some AI-based performance right away from a new Copilot+ PC and even more down the road as the concept of hybrid AI (which can use the capabilities of both the cloud and the local device) becomes more common.\n\nAt today's launch event, Microsoft announced that these new Copilot+ PCs will be priced starting from $999 and are available for pre-order today. Shipments and in-store availability begin June 18. In addition, each of the PC vendors announced they will have several different versions -- targeted at both consumers and businesses -- available at the same time.\n\nAs a 40+-year old category of devices, PCs have been through many changes over the last few decades, but the launch of the new Copilot+ PCs is unquestionably one of the biggest.\n\nBy making the NPU a new standard part of PC architecture, PCs can start to take advantage of the tremendously rapid growth in AI-based software and services, perfectly timed to their recent release. Plus, given the early stage of AI software development that we're still in, the great news about these Copilot+ PCs is that their performance and capabilities should improve over time. Now that's the kind of makeover that anyone can appreciate.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_(computer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mac (computer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Videotelephony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IBM PC compatible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Web application"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/20/USAT/73777716007-copilot-plus-600-a-002.png?auto=webp&crop=599,337,x0,y103&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 4360, "textEnd": 4367}], "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Microsoft's take on this is called Copilot+ PCs. To qualify as a Copilot+ PC, a system will need to have neural processing unit (NPU) performance of at least 40 TOPs (trillions of operations per second) and have 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage at minimum. This is so the PC can run generative AI processes locally rather than via the cloud. That's a strategy we've seen in some recent flagship smartphones, such as Google Pixel devices.\n\nMicrosoft says it has completely reimagined the Windows PC to run on a new infrastructure that combines the CPU, GPU and NPU.

Plus, every big laptop maker under the sun is coming out with refreshed, ultra-thin laptops that all promote major performance gains while saving big on battery life.\n\nOh, and AI. Lots and lots of AI. Practically an avalanche of AI exhortations.\n\nThe Microsoft Surface 2-in-1s haven't exactly stood out from the pack in recent years, but that could change with the Surface Pro sporting the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chip. The smaller version weighs in at just under two pounds, and the thinner bezels allow for more screen real estate. Microsoft claims the new version is 80% faster than the last generation, and yet it will have 14 hours of battery life in video playback. You also have the option for an OLED or LCD screen.\n\nThere's also a new Surface Laptop Go that also sports Qualcomm's latest chips, but just as last year's devices got a fair bit more pricey, these latest Microsoft-brand laptops aren't getting any cheaper. The 13.8-inch Pro starts at $1,000, while the 15-inch goes for $1,200 at the low end. However, unlike Apple's latest laptops, which only have 8 GB of RAM, the Surface Pros have 16 GB.\n\nThere's going to be new ARM64 implementations of Windows 365. However, there will still be some apps that don't support an ARM version. The company is releasing a new emulator called Prism that should be able to handle older apps that don't yet have an ARM version. Still, while you can easily run Chrome or Adobe products on a Copilot+ PC, you could eventually come across an app that requires more effort than you might be used to on modern plug-and-play x86-x64 Windows devices.\n\nThis would already seem like a strong start, but Microsoft can't stop, won't stop talking about AI. A ton of AI-centric software is coming to Copilot, and Microsoft says the new PCs should be able to handle \"small language models\" on these Copilot+ devices. Microsoft claims the PCs are 20 times more powerful at non-gaming tasks compared to past 2-in-1s and many times better at running AI-centric tasks, in this case, processing a simplified AI workload. Does that translate into running GPT-4o's voice capabilities on-device? Not by half, but there will be some AI capable of working on-device rather than the cloud. It remains unclear whether Copilot itself is one of those.\n\nInstead, these \"small language models\" are supposed to be persistent AI running in the background on these new devices. Two of the big ones to drop this year are Recall, a kind of always-on timeline of stuff you did on your PC, and some on-device AI image generation in Cocreator. There's also a live captions feature that should be able to generate text from audio in more than 40 languages.\n\nSo the \"small language model\" is just marketing speak for smaller AI programs capable of running on the device rather than a distant data center that requires quite a lot of GPUs, power, and water to run every day. However, it seems for now that the Copilot chatbot itself will remain a cloud-only operation.\n\nAsus, Acer, Dell, HP, and other OEMs all revealed their latest slim, portable laptops Monday in preparation for tomorrow's Microsoft Build developer conference. These laptops will sport either the Snapdragon X Elite or Snapdragon X Plus, two AI-centric chips that are supposed to power what's going to become a new line of ARM-based Windows PCs. The Elite comes stock with a 12-core CPU that goes up to 3.8 Ghz as well as the built-in Adreno GPU with up to 4.6 TFLOPs on the top end. Qualcomm has made major claims that the chips beat Intel's latest Ultra 7 and Ultra 9 CPUs in performance at lower power.\n\nThe chipmaker has even claimed it can beat Apple's M3 chip seen in the latest MacBook Airs and baseline MacBook Pros in multi-thread CPU performance benchmarks. We'll still need to get our hands on them to see if those claims hold up. However, the company's big claim to fame is the 45 TOPS (trillions of operations per second) of neural processing performance in both chips in the Snapdragon X lineup. This is compared to Intel's latest AI-centric chips, which could do 34 tops in total, with 11 stemming from the dedicated NPU.\n\nHow much that AI capability matters all depends on how much AI is handled on-device and which apps will utilize Copilot+'s capabilities. As a reminder, the last time Microsoft tried an ARM-based Surface with the Go 3, it didn't go so great, with a performance that really couldn't match competitors' or even Intel's chips. Plus, even with the power and efficiency of the latest Qualcomm chips, these Copilot+ PCs aren't going to be great for gaming, at least to start. That's all due to the lack of support from game developers compared to the x86-based CPUs from Intel and AMD.\n\nSo, if these devices prove as capable as the claims say, they'll only really be useful for daily productivity tasks. There's nothing wrong with that, but Apple already has its locked-down ecosystem under the M-series chips.\n\nThe big computer manufacturers are out in force supporting Windows' AI hardware push. Gizmodo has already gone in-depth with Lenovo's offerings, but there are also a few surprises in store. The Asus Vivobook series is getting into the Copilot+ game with the $1,300 Vivobook S 15. It packs a 3K OLED screen and a purported 18 hours of battery life. It has a few more self-styled AI features, like automatic face detection to dim the screen when you're not there and an auto-lock feature.\n\nNot to be outdone, Acer has a new, ultraportable Swift 14 laptop that is so set up for Windows AI that its trackpad will light up when Windows' Copilot AI comes online.\n\nThe laptop itself is a refresh of the company's ultra-portable line of laptops but with a new AI-centric twist. Acer is set to mark out its AI-fronted PCs with a massive \"AI icon\" you can find on the exterior cover as well as the trackpad.\n\nWhat else you get is relatively standard for this type of PC. It's an IPS LCD display at 2560x1600 resolution and a 120 Hz refresh rate. You can get it with or without a touchscreen. It's supposed to be available starting in July, along with many other AI PCs.\n\nAnd Dell isn't being shy, either. The OEM has not one but five new laptop models, all sporting the Snapdragon X Plus or X Elite. The Dell XPS 13, once dubbed the XPS 13 Plus, now contains the new ARM chip alongside the likes of the Inspiron 14 Plus, Inspiron 14, Latitude 7455, and Latitude 5455. The XPS is especially prominent, with a promised 27-hour battery life.

But amid rumors that Microsoft is preparing to announce Windows 12, even more extensive AI integration could be on the horizon.\n\nAI Devices\n\nAlthough Microsoft's primary AI focus is on software and services, since launching a range of AI-optimized laptops earlier this year, artificial intelligence has also been central to its hardware offering.\n\nGiven that the company has traditionally used the Build conference to showcase upcoming products, it could unveil new Surface devices this week. If it does, expect AI to feature heavily.\n\nA panel entitled Building the Next Generation of Windows on Arm also suggests the company may have an important AI chip announcement lined up.\n\nMicrosoft Azure in the AI Age\n\nAt this year's build event, there isn't a single session focused on Azure that doesn't have some kind of AI emphasis.\n\nSessions include Extend Copilot for Microsoft 365 with Azure Communication Services which will focus on using Copilot to communicate with external audiences through channels such as email, SMS, and WhatsApp.\n\nAlongside Copilot, workshops will explore deploying various OpenAI models via Azure. For example, one workshop will go into how to launch AI applications using the Microsoft commercial marketplace.\n\nThis reflects how Microsoft's cloud division is increasingly oriented toward the market for foundation models rather than the storage and computing services it has traditionally focused on.", "source": {"uri": "ccn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CCN - Capital & Celeb News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_morales@ccn.com", "name": "James Morales", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Build", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Build"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Visual Studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIX_(Microsoft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MIX (Microsoft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "output"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_365", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft 365"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Applications of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SMS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Databases", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Databases", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office_Suites", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office Suites", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/microsoft-build-2024-focus-on-ai.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

CEO Satya Nadella referred to these as a \"new class of Windows PCs,\" specifically designed to handle more generative AI Copilot processes locally (meaning on-device itself). The technology requires a chipset with a neural processing unit (NPU), and companies like Qualcomm are already preparing chips such as the Snapdragon X Elite.\n\nIn the development of these new AI PCs, Microsoft is adopting a partner-first approach. The tech giant is collaborating with leading chipmakers such as AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm. Additionally, major OEMs including Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, and Lenovo are part of this initiative. This collaborative effort aims to revolutionize the capabilities of Windows PCs.\n\nMicrosoft's EVP and Consumer Chief Marketing Officer, Yusuf Mehdi, stated that the company has \"completely reimagined what a Windows PC\" could be. He claimed that the Copilot+ PCs are the most powerful PCs ever made. To qualify as a Copilot+ PC, a system must deliver at least 40 TOPs (tera operations per second) of NPU performance, and have at least 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.\n\nMehdi suggested that Copilot+ PCs are 58% faster than M3-backed MacBook Air models. He also highlighted the impressive battery life of these laptops, stating they could offer around 22 hours of battery life while playing videos on-device, and up to 18 hours while browsing the web. This performance level sets a new benchmark in the PC industry.\n\nMicrosoft has announced a standout feature for the Copilot+ PCs, called 'Recall,' which is an advanced version of the 'Timeline' feature from Windows 10. This allows users to use natural language prompts to retrieve information based on their memory of it. Importantly, data from Recall will remain on the user's PC and won't be utilized to train Microsoft's AI models, ensuring user privacy.\n\nFollowing Microsoft, several brands have announced their Copilot+ PCs, driven by Qualcomm's Snapdragon X-series processors. ASUS' first-ever Copilot+ PC is the Vivobook S 15. Meanwhile, Lenovo has brought two new models: ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 and Yoga Slim 7x. Dell has introduced a total of five devices: Latitude 5455, Latitude 7455, Inspiron 14, Inspiron 14 Plus, and XPS 13 9345.

It's a new category of device designed and built around AI, and the key selling point of a Copilot+ PC is the new Recall feature. I'm not quite on board with it yet, however.\n\nContents Idealized usageGetting ahead of the narrativeUncharted territory\n\nRecall is a collection of several small language models that run on your device all the time. These models track everything you do, from messages and emails you send to where you navigate within Windows 11. And, as the name suggests, Copilot can recall this information whenever you need it, using it as bedrock context for how you interact with your PC.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nFor showfloor demos and idealized interactions with your PC, Copilot+ sounds like the AI \"superpower\" that Microsoft has described it as. You can bring up that single sentence from a multipage document when typing an email later in the week, or you can recall that recipe you scrolled past, but forgot to save. Microsoft says: \"Copilot+ PCs organize information like we do - based on relationships and associations unique to each of our individual experiences.\"\n\nIt sounds great, but there's an obvious privacy concern with Copilot+. It's so obvious that Microsoft is already getting ahead of the conversation with multiple settings to control how Recall scans and stores your information. Even with the settings, I'm not ready to dive into the world of a Copilot+ PC.\n\nIdealized usage\n\nI'm not saying I use my PC for any nefarious purposes, and I'm sure you don't, either, but there are plenty of things I use my PC for that I'd rather not share widely. I'm sure you can think of a few examples yourself. It doesn't matter if it's Googling \"is a canker sore herpes\" or looking up how long you should stay on the toilet before calling your doctor, you've probably searched and browsed online for a multitude of dubious topics out of concern or pure curiosity. Throw in any messaging service -- Microsoft used Discord as an example onstage -- and the examples only multiply.\n\nOf course, all of this browsing is being tracked by someone, somewhere already. And in defense of Copilot+, all of the tracking it does is local and private. \"Recall leverages your personal semantic index, built and stored entirely on your device. Your snapshots are yours; they stay locally on your PC,\" Microsoft's blog post reads. The problem isn't Microsoft snooping around. It even claims it won't be using that data to train AI. But it's feeding information into an AI that might throw it off balance.\n\nIt's hard to forget the early days of Bing Chat, where a slight deviation in prompting could send the AI on a tirade. Even recently, specific inputs into Copilot (the rebranded version of Bing Chat) will send it down a dark rabbit hole. Feed a Copilot+ PC some strange information, even unintentionally, and it might spit out some strange results.\n\nThat's not to say a Copilot+ PC will have problems, but this is still uncharted territory. The models are being fed a ton of information, and it's hard to imagine this new ecosystem will be free of issues. If the AI decides that two unrelated topics are actually connected, it won't be all that helpful.\n\nThere's a stark difference between the idealized way you use your PC, the way that companies like Microsoft would like to show off in a keynote presentation or on a show floor, and how you actually use your PC. Especially in the early days of Copilot+ PCs, some wires are destined to get crossed in a way users (and maybe even Microsoft) don't anticipate.\n\nGetting ahead of the narrative\n\nIn Microsoft's defense, it recognizes that there's a privacy issue with Copilot+, even if everything happens on your device. I'm glad to see that there's some control over what the models can and can't interact with, as I imagine that will be an essential issue for early adopters.\n\nMicrosoft says that Recall uses \"snapshots\" of your PC usage to provide context. Thankfully, you're free to browse and delete these snapshots, as well as adjust the range of time that the models use the snapshots. You can also pause Recall in the System Tray for brief periods of time, as well as filter apps or websites from being tracked.\n\nIt's great to have so many options, and I'm sure early adopters will take advantage of them generously. The user-facing options might not tell the full story, however. We've seen that previously with Microsoft. With Windows 10, for example, Microsoft starting tracking far more user data, which you could turn off in the settings. After the release of the operating system, however, PCWorld discovered that you could only disable some of the tracking, and not all of it.\n\nNone of the data for a Copilot+ PC is being sent to Microsoft, and the company says it won't use that data to train AI models. Companies have been caught using unsuspecting users' data to train AI models in the past, but Microsoft's official stance now is that it won't do that. Regardless, we still don't know if there's some amount of data that's required for a Copilot+ PC, or if you really have as much control over the device as Microsoft suggests.\n\nUncharted territory\n\nThere are a lot of details about Copilot+ PCs that are still up in the air and, normally, we'd see a deluge of reporting on what the devices are capable of -- and where they fall short -- in the days following an official announcement. This category of device is in a unique situation because it requires certain hardware.\n\nA Copilot+ PC is a PC, meaning you'll have to drop at least $1,000 (and likely more) to buy into this new era. This isn't some beta feature you can access through your browser, nor is it a Windows update that will roll out over the course of a few weeks. It's a new category of device, and that means it will likely take several weeks (or even months) before we know the ins and outs of how Copilot+ PCs work as journalists and users get their hands on devices.\n\nI'm genuinely excited about what Copilot+ could mean for the future of PCs. These devices finally answer the main criticism of AI PCs up to this point by giving you a reason to have on-device AI. Still, I need a few more details on how Copilot+ actually works before I give up my DMs and Google searches to an AI model.\n\nEditors' Recommendations Microsoft just kicked off a new era of PCs with Copilot+ Microsoft says 75% of office workers already use AI at work Windows 11 may replace a favorite shortcut with more AI Microsoft Copilot sounds great.

The company held a pre-Build event on Monday that wasn't livestreamed for the public, but it made some major announcements on the AI and Surface fronts.\n\nIts vision for so-called AI PCs is taking shape with Copilot+ PCs, which are designed to run many generative AI processes locally instead of in the cloud. Along with its own Surface systems that will adopt this format, several other manufacturers are making Copilot+ PCs too. Microsoft also detailed some of the upcoming AI features for Windows 11.\n\nThe big news coming out of this event is Microsoft's vision for AI-centric PCs. Microsoft's take on this is the Copilot+ PC.\n\nTo qualify as a Copilot+ PC, a system will need to have neural processing unit (NPU) performance of at least 40 TOPs (trillions of operations per second) and have 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage at minimum. This is so the PC can run generative AI processes locally rather than via the cloud. That's a strategy we've seen in some recent flagship smartphones, such as Google Pixel devices.\n\nMicrosoft says it has completely reimagined the Windows PC to run on a new infrastructure that combines the CPU, GPU and NPU. It's working with several partners to make this happen, including chipmakers AMD, Intel and Qualcomm as well as laptop manufacturers.\n\nThe company claims Copilot+ PCs are 58 percent faster than the M3-powered MacBook Air. The systems will be able to run dozens of multi-modal small language models locally, which will power features like a new standalone Copilot app.\n\nMicrosoft unveiled new business-focused Surface devices a couple of months ago and now the latest consumer models are just about here. Of course, these are among the first Copilot+ PCs.\n\nThe new Surface Laptop has thinner bezels and Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chipset. It comes in 13.8-inch and 15-inch sizes. Microsoft says it's over 86 percent faster than the Surface Pro 5 and comes with up to 32GB of RAM and up to 1TB of SSD storage.\n\nThe switch to Arm architecture should help make the laptop more power efficient. Microsoft claims the 15-inch model will run for up to 22 hours on a single charge while playing videos locally and up to 15 hours while actively browsing the web. The Surface Laptop starts at $999 and will ship on June 18.\n\nMeanwhile, the Surface Pro will have a snazzy OLED display option for the first time. It's said to be 90 percent faster than the previous generation and you seemingly get up to 14 hours of local video playback on a single charge. Sadly, the only ports you'll get are two USB-C ones.\n\nA version with an LCD screen starts at $1,000 and it comes with a Snapdragon X Plus chip, 256GB of storage and 16GB of RAM. If you want the OLED display, pricing starts at $1,500. Bear in mind that if you want a physical keyboard, you'll need to buy that separately. The new Flex Keyboard costs $350, or $450 if you want to bundle in a Surface Pen.\n\nHP has a couple too in the form of the Omnibook X and the Elitebook Ultra, and we've already had the chance to go hands-on with the former. The company is also taking the opportunity to rebrand its systems under a single label called Omni, so say goodbye to Spectre, Pavilion and Envy.\n\nWhile some of the snazzy new Windows 11 features (which we'll get to in a moment) weren't available to check out in our initial time with it, we felt like HP had taken a small step backward in terms of design aesthetics. Although it has a headphone jack, the two USB-C and single USB-A port setup may not be enough for your needs. Meanwhile, the Omnibook X runs on a Snapdragon X Elite and HP claims it can run for up to 26 hours on a single charge while playing local video.\n\nThe Omnibook X starts at $1,200 for a model with 1TB of storage. The Elitebook Ultra will run you at least $1,700. Both will ship on June 18.\n\nSince Qualcomm's chips use the Arm architecture, that of course means Microsoft is doubling down on Arm-based Windows 11. The advantages of Qualcomm's chips are clear -- they by and large offer improvements in terms of efficiency, cost and battery life. But Microsoft's previous attempts at getting Arm-based Windows to thrive haven't panned out. We had major concerns about the back in 2022, so much so that we couldn't in good conscience recommend it. Microsoft has had a couple of years since then, so maybe it has finally figured out how to make the most of Arm.\n\nTo that end, Microsoft has redesigned Windows 11 with AI and Arm in mind. AI APIs are now built directly into the operating system and Windows 11 is getting a new kernel and compiler, as well as an emulator called Prism to run x86 and x64 apps. Prism is said to be 20 percent faster than Microsoft's previous emulator.\n\nAs for apps that'll run natively on Arm-based Windows 11 after Copilot+ PCs start shipping next month, of course all of Microsoft's core software is included. Third-party apps including Chrome, Spotify, Zoom, WhatsApp, Blender, Affinity Suite, DaVinci Resolve and many of Adobe's will run natively on Arm too.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Pixel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google Pixel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surface Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surface Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USB-C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chipset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9Gfx3fs0gQeN3oez8ZYLkw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-05/7db33ce0-16cd-11ef-bbfb-315a7655be4b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 2374, "textEnd": 2381, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Now, we begin a new chapter with AI innovation on the device,\" said Microsoft executive VP and consumer chief marketing officer Yusuf Medhdi. \"We have completely reimagined the entirety of the PC - from silicon to the operating system, the application layer to the cloud - with AI at the centre, marking the most significant change to the Window platform in decades.\"\n\nThe new PCs combine traditional CPUs and GPUs with a new \"high performance\" neural processing unit (NPU) that is enhanced by large language models (LLMs) - the brain behind AI systems - running on Azure Cloud.\n\nMicrosoft claims that Copilot+ PCs are up to 20 times more powerful and up to 100 times more efficient for running AI workloads than previous personal computers. It singled out Apple's 15-inch MacBook Air and said that its new PC line outperformed the device by nearly 60pc in \"sustained multithreaded performance\" while also retaining battery life for a day. It claimed that the new PCs can deliver up to 22 hours of local video playback or 15 hours of web browsing on a single charge.\n\nOf the many features these PCs will offer, one of note is Recall. This feature allows users to find something they are looking for and have seen before on their PC by just inputting a few words as a text prompt. The rest, Microsoft says, is done by the computer. \"Just describe it using text or visual search, and Recall will show you snapshots of the most relevant content in a way that feels like having photographic memory,\" Microsoft wrote in a blog.\n\nCopilot+ PCs also come with built-in Windows features that allow users to create and edit images with the help of AI. \"Combine your ink strokes with text prompts to generate new images in nearly real time with Cocreator. As you iterate, so does the artwork, helping you more easily refine, edit and evolve your ideas,\" Microsoft said. Powerful diffusion-based algorithms, the company said, optimise for the highest quality output over minimum steps to make it feel like a user is \"creating alongside AI\".\n\n\"Use the creativity slider to choose from a range of artwork from more literal to more expressive. Once you select your artwork, you can continue iterating on top of it, helping you express your ideas, regardless of your creative skills.\"\n\nMicrosoft has taken the lead in a global push to build and invest in AI. The company's latest quarterly earnings saw revenue reach nearly $62bn, an increase of 17pc for the tech giant compared to last year. Meanwhile, the company's net income was $21.9bn, with a year-on-year growth of 20pc.\n\nFind out how emerging tech trends are transforming tomorrow with our new podcast, Future Human: The Series.

The tech giant estimates that more than 50 million AI-enabled PCs will be sold in the next 12 months, given the appetite for devices with ChatGPT-style technology.\n\nThe newly AI-enhanced Windows PCs will start rolling out on June 18 on computers made by Microsoft partners Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung, as well as on Microsoft's Surface line of devices.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multinational corporation"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Surface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://static.dw.com/image/69134438_6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 2123, "textEnd": 2130}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The Mac vs. PC fires were very much being stoked in this presentation.\n\nMicrosoft's new AI-focused PCs carry the branding 'Copilot Plus PCs.' Copilot being the company's AI assistant. A new Copilot Plus Surface Laptop and Copilot Plus Surface Pro were revealed, while other key manufacturers pledged to offer their own Copilot Plus models soon.\n\nA key feature at the center of these Copilot Plus PCs is the neural processing unit (NPU). This makes AI-heavy tasks like the new Recall feature possible. Recall will keep track of everything that happens on your screen at all times and make it searchable. Even something like a live Zoom call will have its contents automatically transcribed and stored for your future reference. Microsoft sought to allay privacy concerns by sharing that this all happens locally on-device and is thus private.\n\nMicrosoft's new Surface Laptop and Surface Pro are powered by the new Snapdragon Elite X chips from Qualcomm. As such, they require ARM-supported apps so Microsoft announced support from companies like Adobe for a fully native ARM suite of creative tools.\n\nThe new devices are said to have better battery life than Apple's M3 MacBook Air, and faster performance too. Not to mention touch screens, of course. The Surface Pro also comes with an OLED display, positioning it to compete with Apple's M4 iPad Pro.\n\nMicrosoft had an impressive presentation today. It showed off powerful hardware and incredibly useful AI features like using super resolution to restore old photos.\n\nOf course, these new Copilot Plus PCs still run Windows, which is a dealbreaker for many. But I'm interested to see from upcoming reviews whether all of Microsoft's claims of beating the M3 MacBook Air hold true.

Yet, personal computers -- most notably Windows-based laptops -- are about to be made over in a significant way thanks to the debut of a new category that Microsoft and major PC partners are calling Copilot+ PCs.\n\nCopilot+ PCs are next generation AI PCs that combine a new set of hardware capabilities along with a new version of Windows to deliver new experiences to PC users of all types. Given all the intense focus on AI these days, it's probably not surprising to hear that one of the core advancements of Copilot+ PCs is improved performance for applications and services that use artificial intelligence.\n\nFor example, a new feature called Recall, in the special version of Windows that Microsoft is releasing as part of this announcement, essentially gives your PC an all-encompassing digital memory. Recall allows you to search or scroll back through any document, Zoom call, email, or other work you did on your machine in a much more effective manner than you can do with traditional search functions. Remember interacting with a colleague or family member about an upcoming trip but can't remember exactly when or where it happened? Recall can help you find where the reference occurred and gives you the exact context for when it happened.\n\nBut that's not the only benefit. The first generation of these new Copilot+ laptops are based on a chip architecture from Arm (the same company that provides the underlying technology for the M-series chips that power today's MacBook Pro and MacBook Air), and these chips are built by Qualcomm.\n\nArm-based designs, which power virtually every smartphone in the world, are known for lower power usage than the typical x86-based chips from companies like Intel and AMD. That means they're able to drive the kind of super slim designs, long battery life, and impressive performance that have made modern Macs a popular choice for many.\n\nHowever, given the active participation of all the major vendors in this industry-wide effort, including Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung, Acer, Asus and Microsoft (via its Surface line), Windows users will have significantly more choices in designs and configurations than are ever offered by Apple.\n\nPlus, one of the key differentiators of the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips that are at the heart of these new designs is that they include a new component called a Neural Processing Unit (NPU). The NPU, which is best understood as an AI accelerator, is a new component for PCs that is specifically designed to perform certain types of tasks much faster and more power efficiently than they would run on just the main processor or graphics chip alone.\n\nIt's this new NPU that enables features like the previously mentioned Recall, for example. It can also be used to improve the performance and power efficiency of videoconferencing applications, content creation tools, gaming resolution and more. Most intriguingly, it offers the ability to run some generative AI-powered applications like automatic text and image generation directly on the PC without needing an internet connection.\n\nNow, to be clear, popular AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, and many more will continue to require an internet connection, and several of these won't see much (if any) initial benefit from Copilot+ PCs.\n\nGoogle search changes: Google all in on AI and Gemini: How it will affect your Google searches\n\nHowever, as these tools and web-based services mature and the number of Copilot+ PCs in people's hands increases, the expectation is that companies will take advantage of the advanced processing power that these new NPUs will enable. In other words, you'll be getting some AI-based performance right away from a new Copilot+ PC and even more down the road as the concept of hybrid AI (which can use the capabilities of both the cloud and the local device) becomes more common.\n\nAt today's launch event, Microsoft announced that these new Copilot+ PCs will be priced starting from $999 and are available for pre-order today. Shipments and in-store availability begin June 18. In addition, each of the PC vendors announced they will have several different versions -- targeted at both consumers and businesses -- available at the same time.\n\nAs a 40+-year old category of devices, PCs have been through many changes over the last few decades, but the launch of the new Copilot+ PCs is unquestionably one of the biggest.\n\nBy making the NPU a new standard part of PC architecture, PCs can start to take advantage of the tremendously rapid growth in AI-based software and services, perfectly timed to their recent release. Plus, given the early stage of AI software development that we're still in, the great news about these Copilot+ PCs is that their performance and capabilities should improve over time. Now that's the kind of makeover that anyone can appreciate.\n\nUSA TODAY columnist Bob O'Donnell is the president and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research, a market research and consulting firm.

The keynote, which will be headed by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, is on 22 May, 12am SGT. The main focus for the show will be AI (unsurprisingly) and will see new developments to Copilot, the AI-powered tool to support Microsoft 365 users with automation features.\n\nTaking centre stage alongside Microsoft's Copilot will be the launch of brand-new Microsoft Surface Laptops powered by the latest Snapdragon X Elite chipset. These laptops will look to be a contender to Apple's M3-powered MacBooks.\n\nThe company will kick things off with a dedicated Surface event where it's expected to unveil consumer versions of the Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6. As previously mentioned, the new Microsoft Surface Laptops will be powered by the latest Snapdragon X Elite chipset.\n\nAccording to earlier reports, Microsoft is confident that the latest chipset from Qualcomm will outperform Apple's latest M3-powered MacBook Air in both CPU and AI-related tasks thanks to the Snapdragon X Elite's neural processing capabilities,\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft also believes that the new processors will allow for the Surface laptops to have a \"faster app emulation than Rosetta 2\". Hopefully, the brand new Snapdragon X Elite can help to boost productivity usage on the Microsoft Surface Laptops.\n\nIn terms of technical specifications, the Surface Pro 10 and Laptop 6 that were sold to business customers came with up to an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, integrated Intel Arc Graphics, 64GB of DDR5 RAM, and up to 1TB of storage. Other than the processor and GPU, it is likely that the internals remain the same. On top of hardware upgrades, there is also a dedicated Copilot key and advanced 1440p cameras. Though chances are slim, these consumer Surface devices could also have slimmer bezels and larger trackpads.\n\nAccording to a report by Windows Central, Microsoft's \"AI Explorer\" will serve as an umbrella term for a suite of new AI and machine learning-powered features in Windows 11. This is said to include a revamped search experience that understands natural language queries to surface websites, files and more. AI Explorer may also see the introduction of a visual timeline for easy scrolling through recent activities, alongside contextual suggestions based on the user's activity.\n\nBeyond enhanced search and intelligent suggestions, AI Explorer will reportedly expand on existing Copilot functionality. Rumoured additions include live captions generated by AI models, enhanced Studio effects like real-time video filters, and on-device generative AI capabilities for tasks such as creating photos on the fly.\n\nMore AI is coming. With over 137 sessions dedicated to Microsoft's Copilot initiative for integrating AI assistants into coding workflows, Office apps, Edge, and Teams, there is plenty to learn about Copilot and its features at the conference. Beyond the introduction of new Copilot features, expect there to be sessions to help kickstart your journey in utilising Copilot extensions with this session titled \" Developer's guide to customising Microsoft Copilot\". For more information, you can check out the session page here.\n\nFor more updates about Build 2024, you can visit the Microsoft website here.

AI.\n\nThink of it as Microsoft's version of Apple's WWDC, a place for developers, enthusiasts, software engineers, and industry members to be introduced to the latest technology heading to Windows, Azure, and Surface platforms in the near future.\n\nBuild features a number of keynote speeches, live demos, and instructional sessions to introduce people to these new technologies and then instruct them on how adopting them can benefit them or their teams.\n\nMuch of the Build event isn't what you'd call consumer-friendly, with (much like Apple's conference) the event's opening two-hour keynote usually being the place to catch new consumer hardware and software.\n\nIf we're lucky, we may even be treated to a surprise glimpse of Windows 12, wherever that's gotten to. However, we wouldn't hold our breath on that one.\n\nIt's here that we expect most of the more interesting and relevant reveals to take place surrounding Windows on ARM, ARM-based Windows Surface hardware, and AI developments. This year, that opening keynote takes place on Tuesday, May 21 at 12 p.m. ET/9 a.m. PT.\n\nThis year's build event seeks to dive deep into the question of \"How will AI shape your future?\" A question that many are incredibly curious about themselves.\n\nMicrosoft has been a long-time advocate for AI in computing, and years of heavy investment in this technology has seen them propelled to the forefront of AI adoption in everything from its Edge web browser, Bing Search engine, and even the Windows platform.\n\nIts heavy investment and links with ChatGPT-makers OpenAI have given Microsoft access to some impressive technologies and AI models -- which it has already done an impressive job of making use of across its many services and platforms.\n\nHowever, all eyes will be on how Microsoft plans to continue its AI overhaul of the Windows platform and the company's newfound focus on adopting ARM-based chips for its latest hardware.\n\nTraditionally, Windows laptops have made use of x86 architecture, as support within Windows for ARM-based chips has been limited, as has software support from third-party developers.\n\nMeanwhile, ARM SoCs have been more typically found within Apple's computing lineup, powering the iPhone's A-series Bionic and MacBook's M-series silicon chips. The results of which have seen Apple's devices gain considerable traction as powerful computers with almost untouchable battery life.\n\nHowever, Microsoft is primed to finally challenge Apple by adopting ARM processors of its own by way of Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chips. These new chips will feature in a number of Windows laptops going forward, not just Microsoft's own Surface line-up.\n\nHaving already gotten our hands on one of these new ARM-based devices, we can attest to the power and potential of Qualcomm's SoC, with it particularly wowing us when it came to performance in DaVinci Resolve.\n\nCurrently, we're aware of several other manufacturers interested in offering Snapdragon variants of its typically Intel or AMD hardware, including Acer, Dell, HP, HONOR, Lenovo, Xiaomi, and Samsung.\n\nThis will be our first look at how this new chipset features in Microsoft's surface lineup, though. As well as our first glimpse at how its NPU unlocked more AI features when it comes to Copilot in Windows.\n\nMicrosoft's long and storied history with virtual assistants has come a long way in recent years with Copilot now positioned as the new AI companion for users of Windows operating systems and wider Microsoft services.\n\nCopilot in Windows' current implementation leaves a lot to be desired, but given its backing by OpenAI's GPT tech and the recent announcement of the highly advanced GPT-4o model, we could be set to see the Windows AI assistant receive a substantial update in features and overall capabilities.\n\nOne feature we've gotten early word of is Copilot's new AI Explorer -- a feature capable of remembering what it 'sees' on-screen and when, allowing users to ask Microsoft's chatbot to refer to web pages, documents, multimedia, or apps in a chronological manner.\n\nFor example, you may ask Copilot to bring up the news article you were reading earlier in the morning, or continue playing an album you were listening to earlier in the day.\n\nWe also know that Copilot will be gaining improved accessibility through voice commands, which could feature GPT-4o levels of speed and personality. And that a new Power Automate plugin for Copilot will be able to directly interact with your computer and files in a way the chatbot is currently not able to.\n\nAfter the OpenAI showcase earlier this month, predicting which features may be heading to Copilot is hard to pinpoint. While we'd love to see several of ChatGPT's most advanced features make it to Windows 11, we wouldn't want to over-promise in the event Microsoft under-deliver.\n\nThat being said, we'll be paying close attention to how Copilot is evolving and carving out its own space within the Windows platform.\n\nMicrosoft's adoption of ARM SoCs for new Surface hardware should begin a whole new chapter for Windows laptops, one which could completely make up for last year's dismal showcase which took every opportunity to underwhelm.\n\nOur early impressions of Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chips has been incredibly promising, and tomorrow's event could finally be the moment that the AI PC makes the leap from tech's latest buzzword to a true first step into a new era of computing.\n\nHowever, Microsoft's biggest challenge with this event may come down to the capabilities of its AI -- or, more precisely, how people react to what they have to announce.\n\nAI enthusiasm has divided opinion among many, with some remaining staunchly opposed to this new technology, while others are embracing it to its fullest -- if not further still with AI girlfriends/boyfriends and generative resurrections of lost loved ones becoming rising trends in recent times.\n\nEarlier this month, Apple came under fire from AI-anxious creatives after its supposedly out-of-touch \"Crush!\" ad for the iPad Pro M4 caused offense online. The ad ruffled the feathers of AI adversaries with the apparent suggestion that the iPad Pro's computing capabilities could supersede that of the physical arts.\n\nWhile Apple was quick to apologize, personally, I didn't think there was much to complain about. However, never one to pass up an opportunity, and greatly underestimating the ire of Apple's user base, Samsung attempted to capitalize on the Cupertino brand's moment of weakness with an ad of its own, titled \"UnCrush.\" Needless to say, that didn't go down very well either.\n\nHow Microsoft envisions AI and copilot's presence in the future could make or break this year's Build event. If they're too brash and lack a delicate touch when it comes to presenting it's latest AI tools, it may find itself on the receiving end of similar backlash to Apple.", "source": {"uri": "laptopmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LaptopMag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rael_hornby@laptopmag.com", "name": "Rael Hornby", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Build", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Build"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ARM architecture family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaomi", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xiaomi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Edge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Edge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BFL6sRT2uvV567pqetDkGL-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 2252, "textEnd": 2258}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Continue to check back with us as we will be adding more information as it becomes available. Quick LinksWhat is Copilot+, and what can I do with it? Microsoft Copilot+ system requirements Copilot+ release date\n\nMicrosoft just held one of its biggest product launches in its history. It reworked Windows to be optimized for Arm processors, Windows on Arm finally reached maturity with the launch of 15 devices from seven OEMs, and it all revolves around Copilot+, its AI PC initiative.\n\nIt's a big deal, and it changes the computing landscape. So, what does it all mean? Here's a breakdown.\n\nWhat is Copilot+, and what can I do with it? AI PCs are here\n\nI know what you're thinking. It's the same thing everyone thinks when there's a major change is Windows. \"I'm fine with the way I use my computer. Why would I want to change that?\" I know. A computer is a tool we've been using mostly the same way for decades. It's like telling someone they need to start swinging a hammer differently.\n\nMicrosoft wants your computer to be friendlier. It wants it to be smart enough to work with you, not just do the things you tell it to. We're not quite there yet, but here are some features you'll find on Copilot+ PCs.\n\nHP OmniBook X Recall Close\n\nRemember Windows Timeline? It was a feature in Windows 10 that let you look at a timeline that allowed you to access things you were previously working on.\n\nRecall is kind of like that, except with more natural language. You'll be able to scroll a timeline to find apps, documents, and more, but you'll be able to describe things you remember about the document to get back to it.\n\nLive Captions\n\nLive Captions is exactly what it sounds like. You can take any video or livestream and it will give you captions in real-time. Not only that, but it can translate in 44 languages on the fly.\n\nCocreator\n\nCocreator is a name for the feature that AI is probably best known for. You can use it to generate images or text. And remember, this is all happening on-device, so nothing is getting sent to the cloud for processing.\n\nAuto Super Resolution\n\nAuto Super Resolution is a gaming feature. It improves both the resolution and frame rate of your games, and it promises not to impact performance. There have been promises like this in the past, so we'll see how it goes. After all, most Copilot+ PCs are going to have integrated graphics for the time being anyway.\n\nNew Windows Studio Effects\n\nWindows Studio Effects was the first suite of features for AI PCs, debuting all the way back with the Surface Pro X. It allowed you to blur your background, reframe your video, adjust your gaze so it appeared you were looking at the camera, and more.\n\nNow, it's going to do more things like adjust your lighting, and add more filters to you can have a more creative background. Again, the theme is that this is all happening on-device, which is apparently better than just letting Google Meet do it.\n\nAdaptive Dimming and Adaptive Lock\n\nThese are features that we've seen OEMs use, but now they'll be baked into Windows. The OS will know when you look away and it will dim the screen, and it will lock the PC if you walk away. It can also wake the computer when you return, using Windows Hello to seamlessly log you back in.\n\nCopilot Close\n\nThere's not too much to say about Copilot itself, since that's a feature we've had on Windows PCs for a little while now. However, with Copilot+ PCs, much of Copilot will be able to run on-device, thanks to the more powerful NPUs.\n\nMicrosoft Copilot+ system requirements Dell XPS 13\n\nMicrosoft laid out three things that your computer will need in order to meet the Copilot+ requirements:\n\nAn NPU capable of 40TOPS or more 16GB RAM 256GB storage\n\nThis does not apply to any currently shipping laptop. If you bought into any of the AI PC hype around Intel Core Ultra the first time around, you're out of luck. Three processor families are going to support this: Qualcomm Snapdragon X, Intel Lunar Lake, and AMD Strix Point, with Qualcomm shipping first and Intel last.\n\nThe PC will have a Copilot key on the keyboard and will ship with Windows 11 version 24H2, which has the AI goodies listed above.\n\nThere's one other thing to note. You do need an NPU capable of 40TOPS. If you've got a desktop with an Nvidia GeForceRTX 4090, which is capable of 1,321TOPS, you're out of luck. That won't be classified as a Copilot+ PC, not until Intel starts shipping Arrow Lake later this year.\n\nCopilot+ release date Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x\n\nEvery laptop that was announced on May 20 is available for preorder. They will ship on June 18, so that's the date that the entire first wave of Copilot+ PCs will be available. Obviously, they all include Qualcomm Snapdragon X series processors.\n\nAMD Strix Point is next on deck. That should be announced soon, along with various laptops including it.\n\nThen, we should see Intel Lunar Lake laptops pop up at IFA, so expect to be able to buy those in the third quarter of this year. If you're waiting on a Copilot+ desktop, Arrow Lake should arrive after that.", "source": {"uri": "xda-developers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "XDA-Developers"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windows 10"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Original equipment manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Pro_X", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surface Pro X"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Meet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google Meet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo_Yoga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo Yoga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_XPS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dell XPS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel Core"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/05/satya-nadella-copilot-6.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 4639, "textEnd": 4645}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 4691, "textEnd": 4698}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Updates to Copilot expected, focused on accessibility like live captions and voice commands. Microsoft may introduce a new AI Explorer tool with machine learning features at Build.\n\nTomorrow marks the start of Microsoft Build, and as with every other tech event this year, we expect it to focus heavily on AI. Microsoft build is the company's annual U.S. developer conference. It's a three-day event in Seattle packed with instructional sessions, demonstrations, and keynote speeches covering a range of topics to highlight innovations in hardware, software, and, yes, AI.\n\nLike Google I/O and WWDC, Microsoft Build is geared toward developers, but should have some exciting consumer-focused news -- especially when it comes to AI. The exciting consumer-focused news will likely be announced in the opening keynote tomorrow, but if you love to nerd out on technology and data, it could be worth checking out the full list of sessions.\n\nRelated Copilot: Everything you need to know about Microsoft's AI Microsoft's AI leverages the capabilities of GPT-4. It's available in Bing, Edge, Windows, and there's a Pro version. Here's what you need to know.\n\nAI, AI, and more AI\n\nCopilot and AI Explorer\n\nIt should be no surprise that AI is a major focus of the conference. After all, that's been the theme of most things this year, and the tagline of the event is \"How will AI shape your future?\" A quick look at the planned sessions shows an extremely long list of AI-based sessions. Some of those talks focus on the development of AI, such as one titled \"Learn how to accelerate Stable Diffusion.\" Practically, though, where do we expect to see some of this consumer-focused AI?\n\nRelated I tested ChatGPT Plus against Copilot Pro to see which AI is better I created a ChatGPT Plus vs. Copilot Pro battle to see which AI chatbot subscription service is really worth your $20 every month.\n\nFirst and foremost, Microsoft has been pushing its AI Copilot tool, so we expect to see even more Copilot capabilities and tighter Windows integration. Microsoft is backed by OpenAI's GTP, which recently announced its more advanced GTP-4o model.\n\nThat means there could be a substantial update to features in Microsoft's Copilot. It's likely that most new features will have some taste of AI, just like we saw at Google's I/O event last week.\n\nRelated Google I/O 2024: The 13 biggest announcements from the show Android 15 wasn't the focus at all. Instead, it was AI, AI, AI.\n\nThe Copilot updates will likely revolve around accessibility, including live captions, the ability to use voice commands, and more interaction between AI and your computer and files. We always appreciate a focus on accessibility, so we hope that this is indeed true.\n\nWe also expect to see a new AI tool dubbed AI Explorer, which Windows Central says is a catch-all term for machine learning-based features. This new tool could include an upgraded search tool that allows for natural language input. There could even be a timeline feature so you can scroll through anything you've done recently on your computer, making it easier to find that article you read yesterday or the song you listened to in the morning. Who knows, maybe it could keep us from having hundreds of tabs open at once.\n\nRelated 11 annoying tasks Google Gemini will soon handle for you Gemini 1.5 Pro will soon be able to answer questions about the world around you using video, among other key updates from Google I/O.\n\nIt remains to be seen how many of these features are available right away and for free. Many of Microsoft's Copilot announcements have taken months to reach consumers. Microsoft also clearly has a monetization strategy for its Copilot service, so some of the more advanced features could be locked behind the $20-a-month paywall.\n\nWe also expect to see some AI features announced beyond Copilot, as hinted in the session titled \"Learn how to accelerate Stable Diffusion.\" This session promises \"exciting product announcements.\" We just hope they don't push AI-based art production like Google did at its conference last week.\n\nUpdated hardware\n\nNew chips and Arm-based devices\n\nMicrosoft Build typically includes some hardware announcements, and this time is likely no different. Specifically, we're anticipating that Microsoft will most likely unveil new Surface devices. The new devices seem poised to be powered by Qualcomm's Arm-based Snapdragon X Elite chip, which would enable these Windows machines to compete with Apple's recent Silicon-based computers in battery life and overall performance.\n\nRelated Despite Apple's new iPad lineup making the M4 leap, the Mac Pro and Studio won't make it until 2025 That actually makes the iPad Pro more powerful for some tasks.\n\nOffice updates\n\nNew productivity tools\n\nPocket-lint\n\nPerhaps less exciting is the potential for Microsoft 365 updates with, you guessed it, more AI functionality. Microsoft has been pushing custom functionality of Copilot for corporations, so we expect to see more features geared towards those types of users, on top of general consumers.\n\nBeyond AI, we could also see some Microsoft Office VR and AR updates with Microsoft Mesh.\n\nRelated I tried working in VR for a day and it completely broke my brain - and my body Are head-mounted displays the future of work? I wanted to find out for myself.\n\nBeyond AI, we could also see some Microsoft Office VR and AR updates with Microsoft Mesh. There is a joint Microsoft-Meta panel titled \"Meta & Microsoft: The future of Windows productivity and mixed reality.\" While we don't know specifics yet, Meta likely wants to continue pushing the use of AR and VR in productivity settings, so a partnership with Microsoft would be a smart move.", "source": {"uri": "pocket-lint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pocket-lint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abby_ferguson@pocket-lint.com", "name": "Abby Ferguson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Build", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Build"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Accessibility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speech recognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stable Diffusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GPT-4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Edge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Edge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_plc", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Future plc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "output"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription_business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subscription business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_365", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft 365"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office_Suites", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office Suites", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static1.pocketlintimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/teamsbackground_msbuild202401_light.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Now, we begin a new chapter with AI innovation on the device,\" Microsoft said.\n\n\"We have completely reimagined the entirety of the PC - from silicon to the operating system, the application layer to the cloud - with AI at the centre, marking the most significant change to the Window platform in decades.\"\n\nThe new PCs combine traditional CPUs and GPUs with a new \"high performance\" neural processing unit, or NPU, that is enhanced by large language models (LLMs) - the brain behind AI systems - running on Azure Cloud.\n\nMicrosoft claims that Copilot+ PCs are up to 20 time more powerful and up to 100 times as efficient for running AI workloads than previous personal computers. It singled out Apple's 15-inch MacBook Air and said that its new PC line outperformed the device by nearly 60pc in \"sustained multithreaded performance\" while also retaining battery life for a day.\n\nIt also claimed that the new PCs can deliver up to 22 hours of local video playback or 15 hours of web browsing on a single charge.\n\nOf the many features these PCs will offer, one of note is Recall. This feature allows users to find something they are looking for and have seen before on their PC by just inputting a few words as a text prompt. The rest, Microsoft says, is done by the computer as if it has a \"photographic memory\".\n\n\"Just describe it using text or visual search, and Recall will show you snapshots of the most relevant content in a way that feels like having photographic memory. Seamlessly take the next step in your workflow right from the snapshot, including relaunching the original content in a webpage or Microsoft 365 app,\" Microsoft wrote in a blog.\n\nCopilot+ PCs also come with built-in Windows features that allow users to create and edit images with the help of AI.\n\n\"Combine your ink strokes with text prompts to generate new images in nearly real time with Cocreator. As you iterate, so does the artwork, helping you more easily refine, edit and evolve your ideas,\" Microsoft said.\n\nPowerful diffusion-based algorithms, the company said, optimise for the highest quality output over minimum steps to make it feel like a user is \"creating alongside AI\".\n\n\"Use the creativity slider to choose from a range of artwork from more literal to more expressive. Once you select your artwork, you can continue iterating on top of it, helping you express your ideas, regardless of your creative skills.\"\n\nMicrosoft has taken the lead in a global push to build and invest in AI.

This move comes as part of a strategic effort to bring AI capabilities to the forefront of the operating system.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella made the announcement, revealing that the company's laptop partners, including Dell, Lenovo, Samsung, HP, Acer, and Asus, will all offer Copilot+ PCs. Additionally, Microsoft will introduce two new models as part of the Surface range: the Surface Pro 9 and the Surface Laptop 5. It's worth noting that the AI integration is not limited to a specific processor type, as both Arm-based and traditional Intel and AMD CPUs will feature AI functions.\n\nThe AI capabilities come from an NPU, with one of the standout features being \"Recall\". This feature is expected to leverage AI to create a searchable \"photographic memory\" of user activity on the device and will be supported by more than 40 AI models integrated into Windows 11 and Microsoft's own AI assistant, Copilot, which will also support OpenAI's GPT-4 model.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, the new laptops are projected to be up to 58% faster than a MacBook Air in multithreaded performance and feature impressive battery life. To ensure that the performance lives up to Microsoft's promises, Copilot+ PCs will have specific minimum requirements, including a minimum of 256GB of SSD storage, an integrated NPU, and 16GB of RAM.\n\nMicrosoft is positioning these devices as the start of a new era for Windows laptops, with the transition to Arm-based CPUs and the integration of AI capabilities representing significant technological leaps. Although these are ambitious endeavours, if successful, they have the potential to transform the industry, marking a possible shift in the laptop market from using x86 CPUs to ARM-based ones. The first Copilot+ PCs, powered by Qualcomm CPUs, are expected to hit the market on June 18th.

This vision is expected to come to fruition on Tuesday as the company hosts its annual Build Developer conference.\n\nThe annual conference comes after a hectic week of high-profile AI launches. Google's I/O saw the company roll out a large range of AI tools and software updates, while OpenAI strategically launched its long-awaited GPT-4o just one day prior.\n\nMicrosoft, a clear rival to Google and investor in OpenAI, has a unique advantage over other companies when it comes to AI dominance - its Windows software.\n\nThe company and other PC makers have had a challenge keeping PC and operating system sales in the green, as post-pandemic revenue dropped fueled by a slowdown in consumer spending.\n\nDell, the third biggest PC vendor in the world, cut its workforce in March after citing a downturn in PC demand. The move followed cuts in 2023, again citing a potential recession and the lack of PC demand.\n\nHowever, Nadella's comments in January indicate that the company is betting big on AI to get PC sales back to growth.\n\nMicrosoft's Copilot chatbot is currently free-for-all in the company's Bing search engine and for a fee in its Office suite.\n\nMicrosoft's developer conference is expected to delve deeper into how AI will play a new vital role in Windows and how it can be used in a PC for a range of different tasks.\n\nThis could offer Microsoft a new pitch for consumers and enterprise customers to upgrade their computers.\n\nWhat sets AI PC's apart from current hardware is the addition of a neural processing unit (NPU). This is a significantly more powerful chip than a traditional central processing unit usually found in PCs, and are designed specifically to handle AI workloads.\n\nThe NPU chips powering Microsoft's AI PCs will be created by leading chipmakers such as Qualcomm, AMD and Intel.\n\nThese chips can handle AI processing tasks while offline, meaning users will likely be able to get Microsoft's Copilot to aid them with tasks even when not connected to the internet.\n\nIn September, Intel demonstrated how its \"Meteor Lake\" chip could generate a Taylor Swift-styled song without the need for external cloud data centres.\n\n\"For the past 15 years, the dominant developer model has been cloud native,\" Intel's chief executive officer Pat Gelsinger said at the time. \"We believe that the next decade or two of development isn't cloud native, its edge native.\"\n\n\"We see the AI PC as a sea change moment in tech innovation,\" Gelsinger added.\n\nIn March 2024, Microsoft unveiled two new Surface PCs powered by Intel's Meteor Lake processors at a Surface and Copilot virtual event. The company used the event to show how the AI PCs have been designed to address the needs of business users.\n\n\"We designed these products from the ground up with direct input from our business customers, incorporating requested features ranging from enhanced connectivity options to advanced security and performance capabilities,\" Chauncey Larsen, senior product marketing manager at Microsoft, said in an accompanying blog post.\n\n\"These are our first AI PCs powered by the newest Intel Core Ultra processors, with a brand-new CPU and GPU, as well as an integrated neural processing unit - or NPU - for efficiently delivering AI acceleration,\" he added.\n\nAccording to market research from Canalys, 60% of PCs shipped by 2027 will be AI-capable, highlighting a significant shift in the technology landscape.\n\nMicrosoft has, so far, invested over $13bn into ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and leveraged its expertise to create and integrate a range of AI assistants into its software. The company has placed industry-leading AI into its Office suite, as well as in its search engine Bing.\n\n\"While of course it's still early in the long-term AI monetisation opportunity, we feel good about where we are,\" CFO Amy Hood said in a Bloomberg interview, following the release of Microsoft's third-quarter results in April.\n\nMicrosoft also saw Windows revenue increase 11% in the quarter, following a stabilisation of demand for PCs globally. This puts the company in a promising position to capitalise on its investment in AI and its ownership of Windows.\n\nSanjeev Chhabra, managing director and CEO of telecommunications company Beetel Teletech, said the integration of AI into personal computing will \"pave the way for a revolutionary transformation in how we interact with our devices\".\n\n\"Imagine a future where your computer not only responds to your commands but also anticipates your needs, streamlining tasks and enhancing productivity like never before,\" he added.\n\nGlobalData forecasts that the overall AI market will be worth $909bn by 2030, having grown at a compound annual growth rate of 35% between 2022 and 2030. In the GenAI space, revenues are expected to grow from $1.8bn in 2022 to $33bn in 2027 at a CAGR of 80%.\n\nGenAI is expected to become ubiquitous across every industry and become a catalyst for broader AI capabilities such as machine learning, computer vision, and autonomous robots.", "source": {"uri": "verdict.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Verdict"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kurt_robson@verdict.co.uk", "name": "Kurt Robson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Gelsinger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Gelsinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "output"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Hood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amy Hood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.verdict.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2150291492.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The system, which can be invoked from the taskbar and appears as a sidebar in the operating system, also has a dedicated button on the keyboards of new PCs designed to work with it. This was the first time a new key had been added since Windows 95 introduced the Windows key that pops up the Start menu.\n\nNow, Microsoft has announced the next step on the journey that began with that single key, the Copilot+ PC. It makes a small change to the way we think of our computers. By that, we mean the software now defines the hardware, instead of the other way around. But it may leave some feeling left out - especially if you've bought a new laptop recently.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, \"Copilot+ PCs are the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever built,\" which sounds like the sort of thing that's been said every time a new PC line has been launched dating back to the '90s. But underneath their casings, something has changed in this new generation of personal computers. Alongside the CPU, GPU, RAM, SSD and other TLAs that make up the modern PC, there's a new one: NPU. This stands for Neural Processing Unit. They're for accelerating AI applications locally on the PC, instead of offloading the workload to a cloud server somewhere, which is slower and has privacy concerns.\n\nThe first PCs to be announced for the Copilot+ standard all use Qualcomm Snapdragon X series CPUs, a totally different architecture from the Intel Core and AMD Ryzen chips we're used to. It mirrors what Apple did with its M-series chips, breaking from Intel and using the ARM architecture, more commonly seen in phones and tablets, in pursuit of both performance gains and longer battery life. It worked for Apple, so it could do equally well for the PC. This is especially true as claims are being made that the new Qualcomm chips are even better than Apple's designs.\n\nApart from the new chip and the extra key on the keyboard, the big changes come in the software. Microsoft is baking its AI into just about every aspect of Windows, and other software creators are following suit.\n\nWhat this switch in PC architecture means is that, if you've bought a PC with an AMD or Intel chip recently, it might not get the update to the Copilot+ standard. Companies such as HP and Acer are already announcing their Copilot+ PCs. So, the next computer you buy could well support the new tech. All of the devices shown at the time of writing have been laptops or two-in-one devices, but the desktop PC is unlikely to get left behind.\n\nSo you've got your new PC, and the new version of Windows. Then what? Well, there will be some AI-powered image creation and editing tools built right into the OS. Plus, there's the ability to adjust the lighting or add creative filters to video calls. This includes the illusion of maintaining eye contact with the camera even though you're looking elsewhere. Nvidia Broadcast can already do this last one, but requires one of the company's GPUs to run and can look a bit uncanny in use, so it will be interesting to see if the Copilot+ version appears more natural.\n\nThen there's Cocreator, a drawing app that generates artwork from your initial sketches. And you will be able to generate live captions for any media you're playing. Windows claims that it can translate more than 40 languages to English subtitles instantly. This is all without having to use the cloud.\n\nThe big announcement, however, has to be Recall. This appears to be a massive, searchable history of everything you've done with your PC, including voice chats, web searches, documents and emails. It allows you to go back to something you were doing months ago and have half forgotten about, either by scrolling through the timeline or by searching using object recognition or keywords.\n\nAI smarts are also going to become more prevalent in other applications. Companies such as Adobe are already integrating it into the likes of Photoshop. It's also beginning to appear in apps like the pro video editing tool DaVinci Resolve, music app djay Pro, and animation programs such as Cephable. In many cases, it takes over time-consuming jobs such as accurately selecting objects in images and video so that they can be removed or manipulated. As the number of AI PCs out there increases, so the apps that take advantage of them, and the things they can do, will multiply.\n\nProbably not right now. Especially if you're content with the way your current PC works. But they're going to become hard to avoid. Apple's experience with the M chips in its MacBooks and other computers has shown that the energy-efficient new processors leave nothing behind when it comes to crunching through data. The extended battery life you get from them is nother great bonus in a portable machine.\n\nMicrosoft has tried this sort of thing before. It tried to reinvent Windows 98 so that it worked more like the web, with an Active Desktop full of web content and a single click to open folders and applications. But it didn't catch on. This is why you still have a background image and double click on things today, but with AI set to revolutionise the world of computing just as the easy communication capabilities of the internet did, even if we're still not completely sure what shape that revolution will take, these new PCs look like a big first step into that world.", "source": {"uri": "stuff.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stuff"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ian_evenden@stuff.tv", "name": "Ian Evenden", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer keyboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_key", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windows key"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_95", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windows 95"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taskbar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taskbar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Start_menu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Start menu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solid-state drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.stuff.tv/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/Copilot-PC-Hero.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Here are all the AI features for Copilot+ PCs.\n\nMicrosoft kicked off Build with a Surface event today, which launched a new computing category called Copilot+ PC. This new line of artificial intelligence PCs will give users an elevated AI experience in their everyday workflow, with new functionalities to help users quickly generate content, get live captions and translations, and find anything they've seen on their PC with their voice.\n\nAlso: Every Copilot+ PC Microsoft just announced to take on Apple's M3 MacBooks\n\nThese features will be available to Copilot+ PC users with the press of a button... literally. Microsoft's Copilot+ PCs, much like every new Windows system released over the past few months, will each have a dedicated Copilot button on the keyboard.\n\nMicrosoft announced that GPT-4o, OpenAI's latest AI model, will soon come to Copilot. GPT-4o's text, visual, and audio capabilities will be available through Copilot on the latest PCs. Microsoft showcased an example of a Minecraft player asking Copilot how to make a sword, with the bot able to see what was on the user's screen as his character moved around.\n\nAlso: I went hands-on with Lenovo's new Snapdragon X Elite laptops, and they're scary thin\n\n\"I see that crafting table in front of you, which is great for crafting a sword. You'll need some materials. Can you open your inventory? Just press E on your keyboard,\" Copilot explained to the user. The bot then explained the resources needed to craft a sword, how to escape a zombie in the game, and how to create a shelter quickly. Of course, the use cases go beyond gaming, but it's an example of how the multimodal AI model works with the improved hardware of Copilot+ PCs.\n\nRecall is a feature that records your screen and uses AI to index any information so you can easily search for it later. Instead of entering a keyword into a search bar to find an email, file, or website, users can just ask Recall to \"find that purple heart necklace I saw online last week\" with their voice and have Recall intelligently pull up the website from their browsing history. It's creepy but magically useful.\n\nAlso: Windows' new Recall feature lets you ask AI for that file or email you can't find\n\nThis feature saves the captured content on-device, so users' screen recordings will not be sent to the cloud at any point. Users will also be able to adjust their settings to opt out of capturing certain things and edit, view, and delete recordings. Microsoft says it will not use the captured data to train AI models.\n\nBesides using the dedicated Copilot key, the new AI assistant experience has changed with the addition of drag-and-drop. Now, users can drag and drop items into the Copilot window and have the AI tell them more about them. For example, if you see a historical photo online, you can drag and drop it onto the Copilot window and tell the bot to give you more context of what was happening in that photo and who's in it.\n\nAlso: Want to avoid Google Search AI overviews?

{"uri": "8137515453", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-05-20", "time": "22:35:45", "dateTime": "2024-05-20T22:35:45Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-05-20T22:34:31Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "url": "https://qz.com/microsoft-copilot-surface-apple-ai-1851489578", "title": "Microsoft's new AI hardware has Apple in its crosshairs", "body": "Microsoft smells blood in the water, and it seems to be exclusively gunning for Apple's latest ultra-thin laptops and iPads with devices sporting all-day batteries and ARM-based processors that boast better performance with better energy efficiency.\n\nA new Surface Pro 2-in-1 promises to do everything your laptop and tablet can do, but better. Plus, every big laptop maker under the sun is coming out with refreshed, ultra-thin laptops that all promote major performance gains while saving big on battery life.\n\nOh, and AI. Lots and lots of AI. Practically an avalanche of AI exhortations.\n\nThe Microsoft Surface 2-in-1s haven't exactly stood out from the pack in recent years, but that could change with the Surface Pro sporting the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chip. The smaller version weighs in at just under two pounds, and the thinner bezels allow for more screen real estate. Microsoft claims the new version is 80% faster than the last generation, and yet it will have 14 hours of battery life in video playback. You also have the option for an OLED or LCD screen.\n\nThere's also a new Surface Laptop Go that also sports Qualcomm's latest chips, but just as last year's devices got a fair bit more pricey, these latest Microsoft-brand laptops aren't getting any cheaper. The 13.8-inch Pro starts at $1,000, while the 15-inch goes for $1,200 at the low end. However, unlike Apple's latest laptops, which only have 8 GB of RAM, the Surface Pros have 16 GB.\n\nThere's going to be new ARM64 implementations of Windows 365. However, there will still be some apps that don't support an ARM version. The company is releasing a new emulator called Prism that should be able to handle older apps that don't yet have an ARM version. Still, while you can easily run Chrome or Adobe products on a Copilot+ PC, you could eventually come across an app that requires more effort than you might be used to on modern plug-and-play x86-x64 Windows devices.\n\nThis would already seem like a strong start, but Microsoft can't stop, won't stop talking about AI. A ton of AI-centric software is coming to Copilot, and Microsoft says the new PCs should be able to handle \"small language models\" on these Copilot+ devices. Microsoft claims the PCs are 20 times more powerful at non-gaming tasks compared to past 2-in-1s and many times better at running AI-centric tasks, in this case, processing a simplified AI workload. Does that translate into running GPT-4o's voice capabilities on-device? Not by half, but there will be some AI capable of working on-device rather than the cloud. It remains unclear whether Copilot itself is one of those.\n\nInstead, these \"small language models\" are supposed to be persistent AI running in the background on these new devices. Two of the big ones to drop this year are Recall, a kind of always-on timeline of stuff you did on your PC, and some on-device AI image generation in Cocreator. There's also a live captions feature that should be able to generate text from audio in more than 40 languages.\n\nSo the \"small language model\" is just marketing speak for smaller AI programs capable of running on the device rather than a distant data center that requires quite a lot of GPUs, power, and water to run every day. However, it seems for now that the Copilot chatbot itself will remain a cloud-only operation.\n\nAsus, Acer, Dell, HP, and other OEMs all revealed their latest slim, portable laptops Monday in preparation for tomorrow's Microsoft Build developer conference. These laptops will sport either the Snapdragon X Elite or Snapdragon X Plus, two AI-centric chips that are supposed to power what's going to become a new line of ARM-based Windows PCs. The Elite comes stock with a 12-core CPU that goes up to 3.8 Ghz as well as the built-in Adreno GPU with up to 4.6 TFLOPs on the top end. Qualcomm has made major claims that the chips beat Intel's latest Ultra 7 and Ultra 9 CPUs in performance at lower power.\n\nThe chipmaker has even claimed it can beat Apple's M3 chip seen in the latest MacBook Airs and baseline MacBook Pros in multi-thread CPU performance benchmarks. We'll still need to get our hands on them to see if those claims hold up. However, the company's big claim to fame is the 45 TOPS (trillions of operations per second) of neural processing performance in both chips in the Snapdragon X lineup. This is compared to Intel's latest AI-centric chips, which could do 34 tops in total, with 11 stemming from the dedicated NPU.\n\nHow much that AI capability matters all depends on how much AI is handled on-device and which apps will utilize Copilot+'s capabilities. As a reminder, the last time Microsoft tried an ARM-based Surface with the Go 3, it didn't go so great, with a performance that really couldn't match competitors' or even Intel's chips. Plus, even with the power and efficiency of the latest Qualcomm chips, these Copilot+ PCs aren't going to be great for gaming, at least to start. That's all due to the lack of support from game developers compared to the x86-based CPUs from Intel and AMD.\n\nSo, if these devices prove as capable as the claims say, they'll only really be useful for daily productivity tasks. There's nothing wrong with that, but Apple already has its locked-down ecosystem under the M-series chips.\n\nThe big computer manufacturers are out in force supporting Windows' AI hardware push. Gizmodo has already gone in-depth with Lenovo's offerings, but there are also a few surprises in store. The Asus Vivobook series is getting into the Copilot+ game with the $1,300 Vivobook S 15. It packs a 3K OLED screen and a purported 18 hours of battery life. It has a few more self-styled AI features, like automatic face detection to dim the screen when you're not there and an auto-lock feature.\n\nNot to be outdone, Acer has a new, ultraportable Swift 14 laptop that is so set up for Windows AI that its trackpad will light up when Windows' Copilot AI comes online.\n\nThe laptop itself is a refresh of the company's ultra-portable line of laptops but with a new AI-centric twist. Acer is set to mark out its AI-fronted PCs with a massive \"AI icon\" you can find on the exterior cover as well as the trackpad.\n\nWhat else you get is relatively standard for this type of PC. It's an IPS LCD display at 2560x1600 resolution and a 120 Hz refresh rate. You can get it with or without a touchscreen. It's supposed to be available starting in July, along with many other AI PCs.\n\nAnd Dell isn't being shy, either. The OEM has not one but five new laptop models, all sporting the Snapdragon X Plus or X Elite. The Dell XPS 13, once dubbed the XPS 13 Plus, now contains the new ARM chip alongside the likes of the Inspiron 14 Plus, Inspiron 14, Latitude 7455, and Latitude 5455. The XPS is especially prominent, with a promised 27-hour battery life. So, if you have no real interest in AI, then if nothing else, the new Copilot+ laptops should let you use your laptop for longer.", "source": {"uri": "qz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Quartz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_barr@qz.com", "name": "Kyle Barr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ARM architecture family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surface Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gigabyte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Laptop_Go", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surface Laptop Go"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AArch64"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-in-1_PC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2-in-1 PC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Surface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emulator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Display device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquid-crystal display"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/511fa4d08d38c785f28bf2cb31535cd0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

It just revealed a bunch of new hardware and plans for Windows. Copilot+ PCs were the big announcement, designed to run generative AI processes locally instead of in the cloud. Of course, Microsoft had new Surface devices to showcase these features, but the usual PC suspects also have new laptops that meet the spec requirements -- and include Copilot+ in their name for added chaos. The company also claims Copilot+ PCs are 58 percent faster than the M3-powered MacBook Air.\n\nWe'll drill into some other announcements down below.\n\n-- Mat Smith\n\nAnother patient will get Neuralink's brain implant\n\nIntel-powered Copilot+ PCs will be available this fall\n\nHere are all of the just-announced Copilot+ PCs with Snapdragon X Chips\n\nVolvo and Aurora introduce their first self-driving truck\n\nYou can get these reports delivered daily direct to your inbox. Subscribe right here!\n\nThe new Surface Laptop is a redesigned PC with thinner bezels in 13.8- and 15-inch sizes and Qualcomm's Arm-based Snapdragon X Elite chip. Microsoft says this is the brightest display it has ever shipped, at 600 nits, and the new Studio Camera is now in the bezel, so no visible notch.\n\nWill the Snapdragon X Elite give better performance? Expect potent battery life. Microsoft claims the 15-inch model will run for up to 22 hours on a single charge while playing videos locally and up to 15 hours while actively browsing the web. We've got some hands-on impressions right here, but we've got reservations. Devices like the Surface Pro 9, which ran Windows on Arm, still didn't feel as fast or responsive compared to their more traditional x86-based counterparts.\n\nContinue reading.\n\nMicrosoft says it has rebuilt core components of Windows 11 to better support Arm-based hardware and AI. That includes a new kernel, compiler and, most importantly, an emulator named Prism, for running older x86 and x64 apps. Thanks to a powerful new Neural Processing Unit (NPU) in the Snapdragon X Elite chips, Copilot+ PCs can run more than 40 trillion operations per second, a measure of a chip's AI performance, more than four times the performance of today's AI PCs.\n\nContinue reading.\n\nThis sounds very good. Microsoft also announced Recall, a new feature to make local Windows PC searches as quick and effective as web searches, tapping into AI to add more contextual search parameters. Microsoft product manager Caroline Hernandez gave the example of searching for a blue dress on Pinterest using a Windows PC with Recall. She can search the Recall timeline for 'blue dress' (using her voice), which pulls all of her recent searches, saving her from having to sift through browser history. She further refined the query with more specific details like 'blue pantsuit with sequined lace for Abuelita,' and Rewind delivered relevant results. Microsoft says it can start with exact information or vague contextual clues to find what you want -- and it's apparently all done locally. It is, however, a Copilot+ exclusive.\n\nContinue reading.\n\nAI companies love to tap Scarlett Johansson's star power, but this time it's a bigger player in AI. Johansson accused OpenAI of copying her voice for one of the ChatGPT voice assistants, despite her denying the company permission to do so. Johansson's statement on Monday came hours after OpenAI said it would no longer use the voice. \"The voice of Sky is not Scarlett Johansson's, and it was never intended to resemble hers,\" an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement sent to Engadget.

They used the opportunity to preview the first PCs built based on the Copilot+ standard. All the new devices will ship with a Qualcomm Inc. processor, a second chip optimized to protect sensitive data and dozens of built-in AI models.\n\nQualifying for the Copilot+ badge requires a PC to feature at least 16 gigabytes of RAM and a 256-gigabyte storage pool. More notably, hardware makers will have to equip their machines with an AI-optimized processing module. According to Microsoft, that module must provide over 40 TOPs of performance, which equals 40 trillion computations per second.\n\nAlongside the AI accelerator, Copilot+ devices will have to feature a second specialized compute module: a so-called security processor. Its purpose is to prevent hackers from accessing sensitive data such as the encryption keys that protect a user's files. Copilot+ PCs security processors will be based on a Microsoft-developed chip design known as Pluton.\n\n\"It helps protect credentials, identities, personal data, and encryption keys, making it significantly harder to remove, even if a cyberattacker installs malware or has physical possession of the PC,\" David Weston, Microsoft's vice president of enterprise and operating system security, wrote in a blog post.\n\nA second set of cybersecurity enhancements will be implemented at the software level. According to Microsoft, devices with a Copilot+ badge will feature a hardened version of the Windows Hello biometric login method that is less susceptible to hacking. For added measure, the company is phasing out NTLM, a legacy Windows feature for processing user login requests that can lead to cybersecurity risks in certain situations.\n\nCopilot+ devices will reportedly ship with more than 40 built-in AI algorithms. Some are so-called small language models developed by Microsoft with hardware efficiency in mind. Others are diffusion models, neural networks optimized for image generation tasks.\n\nOne of the features that the built-in AI algorithms will power is a new Windows capability called Recall. According to Microsoft, it allows users to more easily search for information across documents, webpages and applications. It's joined by Cocreator, a set of AI-powered graphic design features designed to ease common image editing tasks.\n\nThe enhancements are rolling out alongside a dedicated app for Microsoft's Copilot AI assistant. According to the company, the app will be powered by OpenAI's latest GPT-4o large language model. The model is significantly better at processing multimodal input than its predecessor and features a more hardware-efficient architecture.\n\n\"Every Copilot+ PC comes with your personal powerful AI agent that is just a single tap away on keyboards with the new Copilot key,\" Yusuf Mehdi, the Chief Marketing Officer of Microsoft's consumer business, detailed in a blog post. \"Copilot will now have the full application experience customers have been asking for in a streamlined, simple yet powerful and personal design.\"\n\nThe first Copilot+ PCs will become available on June 18 starting from $999. Most of the devices are made by major computer manufacturers such as Dell Technologies Inc., HP Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. They're rolling out alongside two machines developed by Microsoft itself.\n\nThe cloud computing and software giant's first Copilot+ device, the Surface Laptop, is powered by systems-on-chip from Qualcomm Inc.'s Snapdragon X processor lineup. The SOCs feature an onboard AI accelerator that provides 45 TOPS of performance. The Surface Laptop can be ordered in a 13.5-inch or 15-inch configuration with up to 64 gigabytes of RAM and one terabyte of flash storage.\n\nThe machine is rolling out alongside a new Copilot+ version of the Surface Pro, Microsoft's two-in-one PC. It's a 10.6-inch tablet that can be turned into a laptop with the help of a detachable keyboard. The Flex Keyboard, as the accessory is called, is also capable of connecting to the Surface Pro wirelessly and doubles as a stylus charger.\n\nLike the Surface Laptop, the Surface Pro ships with a Snapdragon X processor from Qualcomm. Users may order the device with up to 32 gigabytes of RAM and one terabyte of storage. The top-end configurations also feature an OLED screen with higher display quality than the panel in the device's standard edition.", "source": {"uri": "siliconangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SiliconANGLE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Modular programming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Key (cryptography)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_cryptoprocessor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secure cryptoprocessor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technical standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Login", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Login"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Windows 10"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Weston_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Weston (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial neural network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biometrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gigabyte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphic design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Electronics", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Technologies", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dell Technologies"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Disk_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Disk Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2024/05/Copilot.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 3392, "textEnd": 3399}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

New devices that want to be part of Microsoft's cool new club will have to tick a few specific boxes to be eligible - they need to have built-in AI hardware and support Microsoft's new AI features.\n\nThat built-in hardware takes the form of a dedicated NPU (Neural Processing Unit) chip, like the one Qualcomm is shipping with its new Snapdragon X-series processors. Although, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that Intel and AMD-powered laptops will also offer AI features.\n\nOne of the new features Microsoft will ship for the smarter Copliot+ PCs to take advantage of is called Recall. It's the Windows version of Rewind, or an official version of Windrecord. Like those programs, Recall will turn everything you have done and seen on your PC into a searchable, virtual photographic memory.\n\nMicrosoft says the new feature will build a \"personal semantic index\" for you which will only be stored on your device and that users will have the ability to delete snapshots or ranges of time or filter apps and programs out completely. As safe as Microsoft wants that to sound, it's only a matter of time before someone finds a way to exploit it.\n\nMaybe the new \"Microsoft Pluton Security processor\" will help with that. It will be enabled by default on all Copilot+ PCs, along with other security improvements Microsoft says it made.\n\nThe company isn't shy about performance claims either. Copilot+ PCs can apparently \"outperform Apple's MacBook Air 15\" by up to 58% in sustained multithreaded performance.\"\n\nA footnote tells us this claim specifically refers to machines sporting 12-core and 10-core Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus chips compared to a vanilla 8-core M3 MacBook Air 15in. So it's no wonder they're faster. It also mentions that \"[p]erformance will vary significantly between device configuration and usage\" so some salt is required here.\n\nTo reach those performance levels, Copilot+ PCs will have other hardware requirements so they can deliver on Microsoft's loft performance claims. They will need at least 256GB of SSD storage, 16GB of RAM, and an integrated NPU somewhere inside.\n\n\"Today is kind of a special day.

These PCs come with Neural Processing on the deck and lots of AI features to use that hardware, and here's everything you need to know about them and the new features.\n\nOne of the first features the giant announced on stage is the Recall feature. The feature was previously internally referred to as AI Explore. As the name suggests, Recall can help you remember things you previously did on your PC. For example, asking Recall to remind you again about the chat you had last night with one of your Discord friends, etc.\n\nThe new Photos app with a Super Resolution feature is coming soon. The feature will reportedly be Copilot Plus PCs-exclusive. By using the same, users will be able to restore old photos in high quality. Additionally, Microsoft also showcased an AI narrator which will, well, narrate what's in the pictures.\n\nNext up, Cocreator is a new feature that can help you create something with ease. You can ask it to generate an entire image, but at the same time, direct it to follow what you're drawing. This way, the end result could be much closer to what you were thinking and not completely dependent on AI. Cocreator will be Copilot Plus PCs exclusive.\n\nSimilarly, the Restyle feature can generate newly styled images of your existing photos based on a preset style. The image created this way will look like an entirely new image.\n\nLive Captions is another new feature, that can help you translate audio that passes through the microphone on Copilot Plus PCs in real time. Microsoft claims the feature supports English translations for 40+ languages across all apps.\n\nWindows Studio Effects should help you look the best during professional meetings. Some of the features include portrait lighting, enhanced noise-canceling, background blur, and creative filters. Users will be able to access these features in Quick Settings on Copilot Plus PCs.\n\nMicrosoft also demoed a few Adobe apps and claimed the tasks in these apps run almost twice as fast as an M3 MacBook. The availability of Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, Firefly, and Express as of the Copilot Plus PC release are easily one of the best highlights of the event. For those wondering, yes, these are native ARM64 versions.\n\nThe giant also demoed DaVinci Resolve and showed how the software uses the NPU to the maximum and delivers quick color edits to videos without slowing down the CPU and GPU.\n\nCopilot on Copilot Plus PCs ship with Open AI's latest model GPT-4o. We've dwelled deeper into the model in our comparisons, but all you need to know is that GPT-4o on Copilot Plus PCs will be faster, more powerful, and more personal. The conversations will feel more natural.\n\nLastly, there's a host of new devices to look forward to, alongside Microsoft's latest Surface and Surface Pro, which the company announced at the event. Some of the prominent names such as Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung will be putting out their Copilot Plus PCs in the market soon.\n\nThe new Surface laptops feature Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite platform. However, AMD with Ryzen AI and Intel with upcoming Alder Lake platforms will also bring new Copilot Plus PCs to the market. Microsoft says the new Copilot Plus PCs will begin to launch on June 18 at a starting price of $999.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Copilot Plus PCs?

The rise of the AI laptop shows no signs of slowing, and it's likely to get a lot more exciting if the predicted Build 2024 debut of a slew of AI laptops equipped with Qualcomm's new Snapdragon X chips proves true.\n\nLeaked Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus and Snapdragon X Elite benchmarks suggest the chips could compete with the latest Intel Meteor Lake chips and even the Apple M3 chip which drives the latest MacBooks. And with Microsoft continuing to push \"AI\" into every corner of its business, it's a safe bet that whatever new laptops we meet at Build 2024 will be showcasing the latest AI features coming to Windows.\n\nHeck, we may even get a glimpse of Windows 12 (or whatever the next version ends up being branded) at Build, though I've heard conflicting reports of whether Microsoft really plans to ship a new version of its flagship OS before 2025.\n\nWe'll find out next week at Microsoft Build 2024, where I'll be reporting live and chatting with Microsoft representatives while our intrepid team works to bring you all the latest news as it breaks. Here's what we're expecting to see at the show.\n\nFirst and foremost, we expect to hear a lot about new features and upgrades coming to Microsoft services in the year ahead.\n\nI expect Windows and Copilot will be the stars of the show as Microsoft pushes AI ever further into its products. We'll almost certainly see a sizzle reel or two chock-full of new ways to tell Copilot what to do, as well as new capabilities for the service and new ways in which it will integrate with Microsoft products like Excel, Teams, Word, PowerPoint and more.\n\nWhen it happens, keep an eye out for release dates and for disclaimers about which features will get locked up behind the $20/month paywall of Copilot Pro. Microsoft has a habit of announcing new Copilot features that take months to actually roll out to users, and now that the company has a clear monetization scheme for the service I have no doubt that many of the coolest and most useful features will either be offered in limited access or be entirely unavailable to folks without a Copilot Pro subscription.\n\nI also expect there to be a ton of new Snapdragon laptops announced next week that are timed to Build 2024.\n\nWe know, for example, that Dell will be hosting its Dell Technologies World event in Las Vegas the same week as Build, which means we'll almost certainly hear about some new Dell notebooks powered by the Snapdragon X Plus and Snapdragon X Elite.\n\nWe've also seen leaks about upcoming products that reinforce this, like a new model of the Dell XPS 13 Plus leaked to debut with Snapdragon X Elite onboard. In fact, rumor has it Dell will be announcing a few new versions of its laptops powered by Qualcomm's new chips, which is a big deal because notebooks powered by the Snapdragon X Elite could crush Intel-powered laptops in at least one key area: battery life.\n\nEven the best Windows laptops have struggled to keep up with Apple's laptops in this key performance area since MacBooks started shipping with Apple silicon inside. But Qualcomm has been beating its chest about how powerful and power-efficient its new Snapdragon laptop chips are, claims I'm eager to see backed up by results in our laptop testing lab.\n\nAnd I don't think Dell will be the only major laptop maker dropping some new Snapdragon laptops during Build, either -- we've seen credible reports of a Samsung Galaxy Book 4 Edge with Snapdragon X Elite coming soon, as well as a Microsoft Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 with Snapdragon X Elite onboard.\n\nPersonally I really hope that last report proves true, because the debut of the Surface Pro 10 for Business and Surface Laptop 6 for Business earlier this year was a real letdown. Neither device features meaningful improvements or upgrades over their predecessors, which is especially painful when you consider that the Surface lineup (with the possible exception of the Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio 2) has been boring, moribund and in dire need of a serious redesign for years.\n\nBut even at the time of their announcement the \"for Business\" suffix made it clear these new Surfaces were not intended for use as personal laptops, so I'm hopeful we'll see more consumer-minded versions unveiled at Build 2024 with Snapdragon chips inside and some compelling new features.\n\nThe prediction I'm least certain about is that we'll get a tease of the next version of Windows at Build 2024.\n\nWhile Microsoft hasn't said much of anything concrete about what's coming next for Windows, Qualcomm's CEO did in an earnings call earlier this year. Specifically, company chief Cristiano Amon said that laptops packing the new Snapdragon X Elite chips will debut in \"mid-2024\" and that their launch will coincide with the \"next version of Windows.\"\n\nSo since we're expecting to see the first Snapdragon X Elite laptops at Build 2024, it sure sounds like we'll also get at least a sneak peek of the next version of Windows.\n\nBut the question is, will that really be a whole new Windows release with a new name, like Windows 12? Or will it be a big feature update for Windows 11 that Microsoft spins as \"the next version of Windows\"?\n\nI think it could go either way, but in my heart of hearts I have a hard time believing we'll see a whole new version of Windows before 2025. Windows 11 launched in October 2021, so for Microsoft to turn around and put out a new version within 3 years seems like a stretch.\n\nBut then, the AI PC craze has seemed like nothing but a huge stretch on the part of Intel, Microsoft and others to try and boost PC sales after the post-pandemic slump. A new version of Windows, with a big focus on on-device AI features and capabilities, could be one way for Microsoft to push people toward buying new AI PCs.\n\nIf you care about Windows PCs, Build 2024 is worth paying attention to because it's likely we'll be hearing about a ton of new features and products that will be coming in the year ahead.\n\nOf course, you better brace yourself to hear \"AI\" said at least a few hundred times over the course of the week. All signs point to that being Microsoft's focus for at least the next year, so expect there to be a heaping dose of AI included in whatever announcements we get about new Windows features for Windows and new Snapdragon X laptops.\n\nI'll be there in person and the rest of our team will be covering Build 2024 remotely all week, so check back early Monday for our live coverage, which will include interviews and hands-on reports about the new features coming to Microsoft products in the year ahead.

We got the thinnest iPad just at the start of May, followed by ChatGPT 4o at OpenAI's Spring Update and Gemini 1.5 updates at the Google I/O 2024 event earlier this week. It's now time for Microsoft Build 2024, which is scheduled from May 21 to 24. Of course, it's an annual developer conference, but after many years, consumers like me are excited about Microsoft's showing.\n\nMicrosoft is expected to announce exciting AI features for Windows 11; powerful yet efficient Snapdragon X Elite laptops, and improvements in many consumer-facing products. From Windows, Copilot, and new ARM-powered laptops to AI Explorer and on-device AI applications, there are tons of reasons for users like you and me to be excited about Microsoft Build 2024.\n\nThe broad theme of Microsoft Build 2024 is AI. In fact, Microsoft asks, \"How will AI shape your future?\" I think, for the first time, Microsoft has the headroom to deliver features and experiences on thin and lightweight laptops without worrying about performance or battery life, thanks to the efficient ARM-based Qualcomm processor. It's time for Windows on ARM (WoA) to shine bright.\n\nJust a day before Build 2024, Microsoft is scheduled to unveil new Surface laptops powered by the Snapdragon X Elite processor on May 20. Rumors suggest that Microsoft will announce Surface Laptop 6 and Surface Pro 10 featuring Snapdragon X Elite at the event. And there will be no Intel variants for consumers this time around.\n\nFurthermore, leaks suggest that the upcoming Surface laptops will rival Apple's M3 MacBooks in performance and battery life. If that turns out to be true, it will redefine Windows laptops as a potential alternative to MacBooks for consumers and developers. I'm very much looking forward to the event.\n\nBy the way, other laptop makers like Asus, Dell, Samsung, Lenovo, HP, and Acer are also gearing up to launch AI PCs with Qualcomm processors around this time.\n\nOn May 20, Microsoft is also expected to unveil the upcoming Windows 11 24H2 build which is said to bring many interesting AI features. One of the most anticipated features is AI Explorer, which can analyze all your interactions on your PC and create a memory. You can then search for things using natural language prompts and the AI assistant will show you relevant bits from its indexed memory.\n\nThere are also leaks suggesting that AI Explorer on Windows 11 will be able to read your screen and help you out with many tasks. Just recently, OpenAI showcased a demo on macOS with the new ChatGPT desktop app which could see the screen and provide real-time assistance.\n\nWhile OpenAI has not released a dedicated ChatGPT app for Windows, it might be the case that Microsoft is itself working on an integrated AI experience for Windows 11 using on-device vision models. And it might launch on May 21, which is pretty exciting.\n\nLeaks also indicate that AI models will run locally on the device leveraging Snapdragon X Elite's incredibly powerful NPU. The NPU can perform 45 trillion operations per second (TOPS), powerful enough to run language and vision models on your laptop and provide AI assistance. This way, your data won't be sent to the cloud, and everything will remain private.\n\nAt the Build 2024 event, Microsoft has lined up many interesting sessions on Windows, Copilot, AI integration, leveraging Snapdragon X Elite's capabilities, and more. In fact, one of the sessions titled \"Building Gen-AI experiences using LLM and LVM\" gives the impression that it would be possible to run large language models (LLM) and large vision models (LVM) on Windows laptops. Pretty exciting, isn't it?\n\nAnother event titled \"Employ AI on Snapdragon X Elite for code generation and image creation\" suggests that deep AI integration is coming to tools like GIMP, VSCode, and more. There is also a session on Qualcomm AI Hub and how developers can efficiently deploy optimized models on the Snapdragon X Elite NPU.\n\nOverall, from shiny new ARM hardware to exciting AI features coming to Windows 11, it's a great time to be a Windows fan. All these interesting events scheduled for MS Build 2024 suggest that brand-new AI applications and experiences are coming to Windows 11.\n\nSo are you pumped up for Microsoft Build 2024?

It wasn't until a couple of days ago that I even realized there was a Windows and Surface event the day before, so hey, why not attend?\n\nOf course I knew that AI would be the focus; Microsoft made a big deal of adding an AI button to Windows PCs earlier this year, and the company's Surface event last fall wasn't about the Surface at all, but rather about Windows Copilot, the company's omnipresent brand name for its various AI assistants.\n\nYesterday, though, a whole host of various threads that Microsoft has been working on for years suddenly came together in one of the most compelling events I've attended in a long time. Windows, of all things, suddenly feels revitalized, and Microsoft has both made and fostered hardware that feels meaningfully differentiated from other devices on the market. It is, in many respects, the physical manifestation of CEO Satya Nadella's greatest triumph.\n\nI should start by noting that some things never change: Microsoft's branding veers wildly between a lack of clarity due to too many brands for similar concepts to too many concepts under one brand. In this case both the company and its partners have been talking about \"AI PCs\" for a while; for example, from the January announcement of that aforementioned Copilot key:\n\nToday, we are excited to take the next significant step forward and introduce a new Copilot key to Windows 11 PCs. In this new year, we will be ushering in a significant shift toward a more personal and intelligent computing future where AI will be seamlessly woven into Windows from the system, to the silicon, to the hardware. This will not only simplify people's computing experience but also amplify it, making 2024 the year of the AI PC.\n\nI don't want to begrudge the effort that I'm sure went into introducing a new key onto Windows PCs, but \"significant step forward\" seems a bit much, particularly given the inherent challenges entailed in a licensing model: in this post-ChatGPT world even my washing machine suddenly has AI, and it seemed inevitable that the crappiest notebook that can barely hold a charge or load a webpage without its fans spooling up like a jet engine would now be christened an \"AI PC.\"\n\nThat is why yesterday brought a new brand: Copilot+ PCs. Yes, it's a bit of a mouthful, but it's a trademark Microsoft owns, and it won't be handed out willy nilly; to qualify as a \"Copilot+ PC\" a computer needs distinct CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs (neural processing units) capable of >40 trillion operations per second (TOPS), and a minimum of 16 GB RAM and a 256 TB SSD. These aren't supercomputers, but that is a pretty impressive baseline -- the MacBook Air wouldn't qualify, for example, as it only has 18 TOPS (and starts with only 8 GB of RAM).\n\nThis guaranteed baseline lets Microsoft build some genuinely new experiences. The headline feature is Recall: Copilot+ PCs will record everything that happens on your computer locally, and make it available to Copilot-mediated queries; developers can add \"breadcrumbs\" to their apps so that you can not just return to a specific app but also the exact context you wanted to Recall. That last bit gets at how Recall is better than Rewind, the Mac app that provides similar functionality; by being built into the operating system Recall can both be extended to developers even as it is made fundamentally more secure and private, with lower energy usage, thanks to the way it leverages Copilot+ level hardware.\n\nAnother fun and downright whimsical feature is Cocreator, which lets you not just edit images using AI, but also create new ones using a combination of drawing and text prompts; I tried it out and it works pretty well, with the main limitation being some amount of latency in rendering the image.\n\nThat latency, frustratingly enough, doesn't come from the actual rendering, which happens locally on that beefy hardware, but rather the fact that Cocreator validates everything with the cloud for \"safety\"; never mind that you can create \"unsafe\" images in Paint of your own volition (at least for now).\n\nWhat will be most intriguing, though, is the extent to which these capabilities will be available to 3rd-party developers. The keynote included demos from Adobe's family of apps, DaVinci Resolve Studio, CapCut, and more, and I presume there will be much broader discussions about what is possible at the actual Build conference. The trick for Microsoft will be in getting Copilot+ PCs at critical mass such that developers build capabilities that actually utilize the hardware in question.\n\nThe hardware at the keynote, meanwhile, was based on Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite ARM processor. The X Elite was built by the Nuvia team, a startup Qualcomm acquired in 2021; that team is made up of some of the creators of Apple Silicon, and while we will need to wait for benchmarks to verify Microsoft's claims of better-than-MacBook-Air performance and battery life, it appears to be the real deal.\n\nIt's also the culmination of a 12 year journey to move Windows to ARM: the original Surface tablet was painfully slow, a weakness that was exacerbated by the fact that basically no 3rd-party software was built to run on ARM. Today the latter situation is much improved, but more importantly, Microsoft is making big promises about the Snapdragon X performance being good enough that Windows' new Rosetta-like emulation layer should make the experience of using x86-compiled apps seamless.\n\nThe end result -- assuming that reviewed performance measures up to Microsoft's claims -- is an array of hardware from both Microsoft and its OEM partners that is MacBook Air-esque, but, unlike Apple's offering, actually meaningfully integrated with AI in a way that not only seems useful today, but also creates the foundation to be dramatically more useful as developers leverage Microsoft's AI capabilities going forward. I'm not going to switch (yet), but it's the first time I've been tempted; at a minimum the company set a clear bar for Apple to clear at next month's WWDC.\n\nLast month I had the opportunity to interview Walmart CEO Doug McMillon. I have occasionally written about Walmart over the years, and I intend to do more, as the company emerges as a genuine contender in e-commerce.\n\nWalmart is succeeding exactly how you thought they might: with an omnichannel approach that leverages their stores to offer delivery, pick-up, and in-person shopping options, including a dominant position in grocery, a nut that Amazon has struggled to crack. Around this model the company is building out all of the other necessary pieces of an at-scale e-commerce operation, including a 3rd-party marketplace and a very compelling advertising business. What is fascinating -- and this was a theme that emerged throughout the interview -- is the circuitous path that Walmart took to get there.\n\nGo back to 2016, when the company acquired Jet.com and I wrote Walmart and the Multichannel Trap; I hearkened back to Walmart's past e-commerce pronouncements and pointed out how half-baked everything was:\n\nThe fulfillment program Anderson went on to describe was ridiculously complex: \"fast\" shipped anything online to your local store, \"faster\" shipped a smaller selection to your house, while \"fastest\" made an even smaller selection available for pickup the same day. Anderson concluded:\n\n\"Fast, faster, fastest. What a great example of a continuous channel experience that cannot easily be replicated.\"\n\nWhat a positively Buldakian statement! Of course such an experience \"cannot easily be replicated\", because who would want to? It was, like Sears' \"socks-to-stocks\" strategy, driven by solipsism: instead of starting with customer needs and working backwards to a solution, Walmart started with their own reality and created a convoluted mess. Predictably it failed.\n\nThe problem Walmart had was that every aspect of the company was oriented around the stores; that by extension meant that new initiatives, like e-commerce, had to fit in that reality, even if it resulted in a terrible experience for customers. That was why I liked the Jet.com acquisition; I wrote in an Update:\n\nWalmart, meanwhile, finally realized a couple of months ago that while they are really good at retail logistics, that skill doesn't translate to e-commerce in the way they hoped. I wrote in June:\n\nAll of those analysts who assumed Wal-Mart would squish Amazon in e-commerce thanks to their own mastery of logistics were like all those who assumed Microsoft would win mobile because they won PCs. It turns out that logistics for retail are to logistics for e-commerce as operating systems for a PC are to operating systems for a phone. They look similar, and even have the same name, but require fundamentally different assumptions and priorities.\n\nWalmart promised at the time to invest $2 billion in technology and logistics, but given Amazon's continued encroachment the company has far more money than time: paying a bit more to get technology and infrastructure already built out is a very good choice...Ideally Walmart will keep Jet.com at arms-length: that's the prescribed response for an incumbent dealing with a disruptive competitor. There are simply too many incentives for incumbent companies to kill new initiatives that by definition threaten the core business, and while Walmart's executives seem to have finally learned that extending a bricks-and-mortar business model online doesn't work, it always takes even longer for that lesson to filter down to middle managers primarily motivated by their own specific responsibilities that often aren't aligned with the future.\n\nFast forward to today, and Jet.com redirects to Walmart.com, and e-commerce is, as I noted, integrated with retail, but that doesn't mean I was wrong. McMillon noted in the interview:\n\nIt was always the plan to bring things together, but just like the structure, it needed to be separate for a while for good reasons.\n\nThe reason is that tech, given its reliance on massive investments on a scalable platform, is inherently centralizing; that, though, is directly counter to how Walmart traditionally operated. McMillon explained:\n\nTaking ownership all the way down to department manager level for toys and store number #1113 has great value in it, and when a buyer feels like they're really responsible for their category, there's great value in that, but we have to, on behalf of the customer and in a customer-led way, have top down decision-making to say, \"No, we're not going to just respond to what you, the buyer, want the next tech priority to be\".\n\nWe've actually set the tech priorities driven off what we want to build for customers and what they're asking us to solve, and that's how it's going to be, and that is a cultural tension even today because we actually want some of both, we want ownership. We don't want to diminish that ownership and our store managers, they make this company go, and they make a lot of great decisions, and they're fantastic. You may have read recently, we increased their pay and we need a tech team and a design team, a product management team and leaders that can identify priorities and make sure they get resourced.\n\nBut take a marketplace, we can't build a marketplace one country at a time, you build one marketplace. So there have to be people that are willing to give up authority so that that gets done in a way that's most efficient and we're doing that now, but I think that tension is going to be here forever.\n\nIn other words, Walmart needed to build up e-commerce independent of its stores; only then, once its e-commerce operation was a viable business in its own right, and as a new generation of leadership in retail recognized its inherent value, could the company achieve the omni-channel dreams it had harbored for so long.\n\nBack to Microsoft: the fundamental problem Nadella faced when took over Microsoft was that every aspect of the company -- including, most problematically, the culture -- was built around Windows. I wrote in Microsoft's Monopoly Hangover:\n\nThe company loved to brag about its stable of billion dollar businesses, but in truth they were all components of one business -- Windows. Everything Microsoft built from servers to productivity applications was premised on the assumption that the vast majority of computing devices were running Windows, leaving the company completely out of sorts when the iPhone and Android created and captured the smartphone market.\n\nFormer CEO Steve Ballmer couldn't accept this reality: in his disastrous last few months he reorganized the company around a One Microsoft concept that really meant that the rest of the company needed to better support Windows, and doubled down by buying Nokia in a deal that made no sense, all while Microsoft's productivity applications were suffering from a lack of apps for iOS and Android.\n\nWhat Nadella did after he took over was not particularly complicated, but it was exceptionally difficult. I wrote in 2018's The End of Windows:\n\nThe story of how Microsoft came to accept the reality of Windows' decline is more interesting than the fact of Windows' decline; this is how CEO Satya Nadella convinced the company to accept the obvious.\n\nI then documented a few seminal decisions made to demote windows, including releasing Office on iPad as soon as he took over, explicitly re-orienting Microsoft around services instead of devices, isolating the Windows organization from the rest of the company, killing Windows Phone, and finally, in the decision that prompted that Article, splitting up Windows itself. Microsoft was finally, not just strategically but also organizationally, a services company centered on Azure and Office; yes, Windows existed, and still served a purpose, but it didn't call the shots for the rest of Microsoft's products.\n\nAnd yet, here I am in May 2024, celebrating a Windows event! That celebration, though, is not because Windows is differentiating the rest of Microsoft, but because the rest of Microsoft is now differentiating Windows. Nadella's focus on AI and the company's massive investments in compute are the real drivers of the business, and, going forward, are real potential drivers of Windows.\n\nThis is where the Walmart analogy is useful: McMillon needed to let e-commerce stand on its own and drive the development of a consumer-centric approach to commerce that depended on centralized tech-based solutions; only then could Walmart integrate its stores and online services into an omnichannel solution that makes the company the only realistic long-term rival to Amazon.\n\nNadella, similarly, needed to break up Windows and end Ballmer's dreams of vertical domination so that the company could build a horizontal services business that, a few years later, could actually make Windows into a differentiated operating system that might, for the first time in years, actually drive new customer acquisition.", "source": {"uri": "stratechery.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stratechery by Ben Thompson"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walmart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ARM architecture family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jet.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Latency (engineering)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gigabyte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thread (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silicon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sears", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ballmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Ballmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nokia"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://149384716.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/windows-1.png?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

All Copilot+ PCs will have a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) at their core, with new Qualcomm chips - the Snapdragon X Plus and X Elite - powering a range of on-device AI tools.\n\nEssentially, these will be edge devices with data processed on the laptops in real-time, as well as in connection with the cloud.\n\nQualcomm's group GM Alex Katouzain called it a \"new era for the PC\" and suggested the capabilities of the AI-enabled PCs would redefine personal computing.\n\n\"We're proud to enable this industry shift, which puts Windows PCs at the forefront of technology and allows users to push the boundaries of what's possible across productivity, creativity, and entertainment,\" Katouzain said.\n\nOn 18 June, a flurry of Copilot+ laptops will be available, with new models of Microsoft Surface among the first wave - a Surface Laptop with either a 13.8in or 15in display and a 2-in-1 Surface Pro.\n\nPreorders are also available for Acer's new Swift 14 AI notebook, the ASUS Vivobook S 15, and two new HP models, the OmniBook X AI PC and the EliteBook Ultra AI PC.\n\nHowever, the key question here, for any of these models, and also any NPU-enabled device that has come before it, is what exactly will you use all this AI for?\n\nGenerative AI has become a disruptive technology in that it is literally changing how PCs are being built and used. There is also an ominous feeling that 'creative' work has been disproportionately affected by the sudden flood of AI tools into our devices.\n\nBut what can users do with these new Copilot+ machines, and what will their bosses actually allow them to do?\n\nThe easiest answer here is that 'generating' work, like an entire email, is probably going to be frowned upon. But the tools that help optimize machine performance and improve the experience clearly have a direct benefit to IT bosses and, ultimately, businesses.\n\nFor example, Acer's Swift 14 will come with a dedicated 'AcerSense' button that can launch tools to enhance video and audio quality. Newer models of Dell's XPS will sport services that can help users diagnose their own IT problems - a definite timesaver for overstretched IT teams.\n\nOne of the features announced by Microsoft is 'Recall', which is a log of everything you've done on the laptop, going back several months.\n\nIf you need to find something, but can only remember the barest of details, Recall can access almost everything you've seen on your computer - web pages, random folders, or throw-away documents - and present them to you as screenshots in a timeline.\n\nWhat's more, all this information stays locally on the device, in 'ringfenced' folders, according to Microsoft.\n\nWhile generative AI grabs the headlines, AI PCs are quietly bringing about tools and processes that make it easier for workers and their IT bosses.\n\nLaptops that can self diagnose problems, improve video conferencing quality, and organize themselves represent an exciting - and, crucially, a more productive - future for all.", "source": {"uri": "itpro.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITProUK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Surface Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Surface Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromebook", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chromebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-in-1_PC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2-in-1 PC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Surface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Swift", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acer Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_XPS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dell XPS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Videotelephony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenshot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Screenshot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Artificial_Worlds", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Artificial Worlds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pxTiedJ2yc3PqAs2zzyQG-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 482, "textEnd": 489, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Nadella unveiled a new category of PC on Monday that features generative artificial intelligence tools built directly into Windows, the company's world leading operating system.\n\nCNN --\n\nMicrosoft jumped headfirst into building artificial intelligence directly into its Windows operating system on Monday, announcing new AI computers that could help ramp up flagging PC sales.\n\nThe developments push the company closer to its long-time goal to \"build computers that understand us versus us having to understand computers,\" CEO Satya Nadella told the audience at the company's annual developer conference in Seattle.\n\n\"I feel like we're really close to that real breakthrough,\" he added.\n\nThe computers, which are packed with processors that power advanced AI tools, come as PC sales have stalled for years. The company hopes the new machines will boost sales and revive excitement, particularly as AI is expected to become increasingly part of everyday life.\n\nMicrosoft's new lineup of Copilot+ PCs, which feature a new Surface Pro tablet and Surface laptop, include AI tools that don't require internet connection - the AI processing occurs directly on the device\n\nThe new hardware plays up its existing AI assistant called Copilot, which works across various products, including Bing and Microsoft 365. It can help with tasks such as writing, keeping track of emails in Outlook or designing presentations in PowerPoint.\n\nOne new feature, called Recall, acts as a personal \"time machine,\" allowing users to quickly find things from their computer, such as documents, images and websites. Another allows for real-time translation into more than 40 more languages locally on the device.\n\nMicrosoft isn't alone in its AI PC ambition. Dell and Lenovo also recently debuted AI-first PC computers under the Copilot+ AI umbrella, an emerging category that experts widely believe will become the next stage of computing. (Copilot+ is the name of the line of hardware that supports the Copilot software.)\n\nNext month, Apple is expected to announce new AI-powered tools for the iPhone and Mac at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference.\n\n\"Over time, AI capability will become a ubiquitous feature, but Microsoft and its partners have made a solid start,\" Geoff Blaber, CEO at CCS Insight, told CNN. \"They will need to work hard to ensure that AI becomes a lot more than just a meaningless descriptor with a growing number of features.\"\n\nMicrosoft's advancements also come at a time when the PC market is ripe for innovation.\n\n\"This is a much-needed catalyst,\" Blaber added.\n\nAlthough the Surface line is relatively small within the overall PC market, it serves as an aspirational brand and a frontrunner in terms of innovation, according to Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager at market research firm IDC. But Microsoft's move is more reflective of a greater shift happening in the industry toward AI.\n\nIn June, Apple will likely introduce generative AI - artificial intelligence that is capable of creating new output from images to text - across its iOS and Mac platforms. Reports indicate the company could unveil an AI-powered chatbot that runs on OpenAI's ChatGPT technology, the same technology that underpins Microsoft's new CoPilot+ line.\n\nStill, Microsoft has already established itself as an early leader in this space with ChatGPT integrated into key products. And it appears those efforts are paying off.\n\nLast month, Microsoft reported quarterly profits of $21.9 billion, up from $18.3 billion a year ago. Revenue grew 17% year-over-year growth to $61.9 billion. Microsoft's Azure cloud business also experienced strong growth - revenue grew 31% - boosted by AI tailwinds.\n\nThe company continues to go all in on AI in other ways, too. Earlier this month, Microsoft said it is pouring $3.3 billion into building a data hub in Wisconsin to train employees and manufacturers on how to best use artificial intelligence. The new center aims to create 2,300 union construction jobs and 2,000 permanent jobs over time, according to Microsoft. It also plans to use the center to train about 100,000 workers across the state.\n\nMicrosoft is set to announce more AI-related updates at its Build conference starting at noon ET on Tuesday.",

The rise of the AI laptop shows no signs of slowing, and it's likely to get a lot more exciting if the predicted Build 2024 debut of a slew of AI laptops equipped with Qualcomm's new Snapdragon X chips proves true.\n\nLeaked Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus and Snapdragon X Elite benchmarks suggest the chips could compete with the latest Intel Meteor Lake chips and even the Apple M3 chip which drives the latest MacBooks. And with Microsoft continuing to push \"AI\" into every corner of its business, it's a safe bet that whatever new laptops we meet at Build 2024 will be showcasing the latest AI features coming to Windows.\n\nHeck, we may even get a glimpse of Windows 12 (or whatever the next version ends up being branded) at Build, though I've heard conflicting reports of whether Microsoft really plans to ship a new version of its flagship OS before 2025.\n\nWe'll find out next week at Microsoft Build 2024, where I'll be reporting live and chatting with Microsoft representatives while our intrepid team works to bring you all the latest news as it breaks. Here's what we're expecting to see at the show.\n\nNew Windows 11 & Copilot features\n\nFirst and foremost, we expect to hear a lot about new features and upgrades coming to Microsoft services in the year ahead.\n\nI expect Windows and Copilot will be the stars of the show as Microsoft pushes AI ever further into its products. We'll almost certainly see a sizzle reel or two chock-full of new ways to tell Copilot what to do, as well as new capabilities for the service and new ways in which it will integrate with Microsoft products like Excel, Teams, Word, PowerPoint and more.\n\nWhen it happens, keep an eye out for release dates and for disclaimers about which features will get locked up behind the $20/month paywall of Copilot Pro. Microsoft has a habit of announcing new Copilot features that take months to actually roll out to users, and now that the company has a clear monetization scheme for the service I have no doubt that many of the coolest and most useful features will either be offered in limited access or be entirely unavailable to folks without a Copilot Pro subscription.\n\nNew AI laptops powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon X chips\n\nI also expect there to be a ton of new Snapdragon laptops announced next week that are timed to Build 2024.\n\nWe know, for example, that Dell will be hosting its Dell Technologies World event in Las Vegas the same week as Build, which means we'll almost certainly hear about some new Dell notebooks powered by the Snapdragon X Plus and Snapdragon X Elite.\n\nWe've also seen leaks about upcoming products that reinforce this, like a new model of the Dell XPS 13 Plus leaked to debut with Snapdragon X Elite onboard. In fact, rumor has it Dell will be announcing a few new versions of its laptops powered by Qualcomm's new chips, which is a big deal because notebooks powered by the Snapdragon X Elite could crush Intel-powered laptops in at least one key area: battery life.\n\nEven the best Windows laptops have struggled to keep up with Apple's laptops in this key performance area since MacBooks started shipping with Apple silicon inside. But Qualcomm has been beating its chest about how powerful and power-efficient its new Snapdragon laptop chips are, claims I'm eager to see backed up by results in our laptop testing lab.\n\nAnd I don't think Dell will be the only major laptop maker dropping some new Snapdragon laptops during Build, either -- we've seen credible reports of a Samsung Galaxy Book 4 Edge with Snapdragon X Elite coming soon, as well as a Microsoft Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 with Snapdragon X Elite onboard.\n\nPersonally I really hope that last report proves true, because the debut of the Surface Pro 10 for Business and Surface Laptop 6 for Business earlier this year was a real letdown. Neither device features meaningful improvements or upgrades over their predecessors, which is especially painful when you consider that the Surface lineup (with the possible exception of the Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio 2) has been boring, moribund and in dire need of a serious redesign for years.\n\nBut even at the time of their announcement the \"for Business\" suffix made it clear these new Surfaces were not intended for use as personal laptops, so I'm hopeful we'll see more consumer-minded versions unveiled at Build 2024 with Snapdragon chips inside and some compelling new features.\n\nThe next version of Windows?\n\nThe prediction I'm least certain about is that we'll get a tease of the next version of Windows at Build 2024.\n\nWhile Microsoft hasn't said much of anything concrete about what's coming next for Windows, Qualcomm's CEO did in an earnings call earlier this year. Specifically, company chief Cristiano Amon said that laptops packing the new Snapdragon X Elite chips will debut in \"mid-2024\" and that their launch will coincide with the \"next version of Windows.\"\n\nSo since we're expecting to see the first Snapdragon X Elite laptops at Build 2024, it sure sounds like we'll also get at least a sneak peek of the next version of Windows.\n\nBut the question is, will that really be a whole new Windows release with a new name, like Windows 12? Or will it be a big feature update for Windows 11 that Microsoft spins as \"the next version of Windows\"?\n\nI think it could go either way, but in my heart of hearts I have a hard time believing we'll see a whole new version of Windows before 2025. Windows 11 launched in October 2021, so for Microsoft to turn around and put out a new version within 3 years seems like a stretch.\n\nBut then, the AI PC craze has seemed like nothing but a huge stretch on the part of Intel, Microsoft and others to try and boost PC sales after the post-pandemic slump. A new version of Windows, with a big focus on on-device AI features and capabilities, could be one way for Microsoft to push people toward buying new AI PCs.\n\nOutlook\n\nIf you care about Windows PCs, Build 2024 is worth paying attention to because it's likely we'll be hearing about a ton of new features and products that will be coming in the year ahead.\n\nOf course, you better brace yourself to hear \"AI\" said at least a few hundred times over the course of the week. All signs point to that being Microsoft's focus for at least the next year, so expect there to be a heaping dose of AI included in whatever announcements we get about new Windows features for Windows and new Snapdragon X laptops.\n\nI'll be there in person and the rest of our team will be covering Build 2024 remotely all week, so check back early Monday for our live coverage, which will include interviews and hands-on reports about the new features coming to Microsoft products in the year ahead. Stay tuned!\n\nMore from Tom's Guide", "source": {"uri": "sg.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Build", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Build"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacBook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_silicon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple silicon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surface Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_XPS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dell XPS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Excel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft PowerPoint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Technologies", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dell Technologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surface Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom's_Hardware", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom's Hardware"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Systems", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8WnuqZsB.Cqp2.wWxOvjUQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/toms_guide_826/7f77d10374aa5a25e8549b50c6179c48", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

It's a new category of device designed and built around AI, and the key selling point of a Copilot+ PC is the new Recall feature. I'm not quite on board with it yet, however.\n\nRecall is a collection of several small language models that run on your device all the time. These models track everything you do, from messages and emails you send to where you navigate within Windows 11. And, as the name suggests, Copilot can recall this information whenever you need it, using it as bedrock context for how you interact with your PC.\n\nFor showfloor demos and idealized interactions with your PC, Copilot+ sounds like the AI \"superpower\" that Microsoft has described it as. You can bring up that single sentence from a multipage document when typing an email later in the week, or you can recall that recipe you scrolled past, but forgot to save. Microsoft says: \"Copilot+ PCs organize information like we do - based on relationships and associations unique to each of our individual experiences.\"\n\nIt sounds great, but there's an obvious privacy concern with Copilot+. It's so obvious that Microsoft is already getting ahead of the conversation with multiple settings to control how Recall scans and stores your information. Even with the settings, I'm not ready to dive into the world of a Copilot+ PC.\n\nI'm not saying I use my PC for any nefarious purposes, and I'm sure you don't, either, but there are plenty of things I use my PC for that I'd rather not share widely. I'm sure you can think of a few examples yourself. It doesn't matter if it's Googling \"is a canker sore herpes\" or looking up how long you should stay on the toilet before calling your doctor, you've probably searched and browsed online for a multitude of dubious topics out of concern or pure curiosity. Throw in any messaging service -- Microsoft used Discord as an example onstage -- and the examples only multiply.\n\nOf course, all of this browsing is being tracked by someone, somewhere already. And in defense of Copilot+, all of the tracking it does is local and private. \"Recall leverages your personal semantic index, built and stored entirely on your device. Your snapshots are yours; they stay locally on your PC,\" Microsoft's blog post reads. The problem isn't Microsoft snooping around. It even claims it won't be using that data to train AI. But it's feeding information into an AI that might throw it off balance.\n\nIt's hard to forget the early days of Bing Chat, where a slight deviation in prompting could send the AI on a tirade. Even recently, specific inputs into Copilot (the rebranded version of Bing Chat) will send it down a dark rabbit hole. Feed a Copilot+ PC some strange information, even unintentionally, and it might spit out some strange results.\n\nThat's not to say a Copilot+ PC will have problems, but this is still uncharted territory. The models are being fed a ton of information, and it's hard to imagine this new ecosystem will be free of issues. If the AI decides that two unrelated topics are actually connected, it won't be all that helpful.\n\nThere's a stark difference between the idealized way you use your PC, the way that companies like Microsoft would like to show off in a keynote presentation or on a show floor, and how you actually use your PC. Especially in the early days of Copilot+ PCs, some wires are destined to get crossed in a way users (and maybe even Microsoft) don't anticipate.\n\nIn Microsoft's defense, it recognizes that there's a privacy issue with Copilot+, even if everything happens on your device. I'm glad to see that there's some control over what the models can and can't interact with, as I imagine that will be an essential issue for early adopters.\n\nMicrosoft says that Recall uses \"snapshots\" of your PC usage to provide context. Thankfully, you're free to browse and delete these snapshots, as well as adjust the range of time that the models use the snapshots. You can also pause Recall in the System Tray for brief periods of time, as well as filter apps or websites from being tracked.\n\nIt's great to have so many options, and I'm sure early adopters will take advantage of them generously. The user-facing options might not tell the full story, however. We've seen that previously with Microsoft. With Windows 10, for example, Microsoft starting tracking far more user data, which you could turn off in the settings. After the release of the operating system, however, PCWorld discovered that you could only disable some of the tracking, and not all of it.\n\nNone of the data for a Copilot+ PC is being sent to Microsoft, and the company says it won't use that data to train AI models. Companies have been caught using unsuspecting users' data to train AI models in the past, but Microsoft's official stance now is that it won't do that. Regardless, we still don't know if there's some amount of data that's required for a Copilot+ PC, or if you really have as much control over the device as Microsoft suggests.\n\nThere are a lot of details about Copilot+ PCs that are still up in the air and, normally, we'd see a deluge of reporting on what the devices are capable of -- and where they fall short -- in the days following an official announcement. This category of device is in a unique situation because it requires certain hardware.\n\nA Copilot+ PC is a PC, meaning you'll have to drop at least $1,000 (and likely more) to buy into this new era. This isn't some beta feature you can access through your browser, nor is it a Windows update that will roll out over the course of a few weeks. It's a new category of device, and that means it will likely take several weeks (or even months) before we know the ins and outs of how Copilot+ PCs work as journalists and users get their hands on devices.\n\nI'm genuinely excited about what Copilot+ could mean for the future of PCs. These devices finally answer the main criticism of AI PCs up to this point by giving you a reason to have on-device AI. Still, I need a few more details on how Copilot+ actually works before I give up my DMs and Google searches to an AI model.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_demo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Game demo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superpower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semantics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rabbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windows 10"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_World", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PC World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9MUdwBj7tcKEagbEdrG0Mw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/digital_trends_973/bf292543ff409646629bc02ae5d8ca82", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

He said he is getting closer to his long-held goal of doing so.\n\nHe added that he feels that we are getting really close to a real breakthrough.\n\nThe computers feature processors that power advanced AI tools and arrive amid years of stagnation in PC sales. The company hopes the new machines will boost sales and bring back excitement, especially as AI is expected to become increasingly part of daily life.\n\nMicrosoft's new lineup of Copilot+ PCs with new Surface Pro tablets and Surface laptops includes AI tools that don't require an internet connection and AI processing happens directly on the device\n\nThe new hardware leverages an existing AI assistant called Copilot. It works with a variety of products including Bing and Microsoft 365. This is useful for tasks like writing in Outlook, tracking emails, and designing presentations in PowerPoint.\n\nThe new feature, called Recall, acts as a personal time machine, allowing users to quickly find documents, images, websites, and more from their computer. There is also a feature that allows him to translate in real time into over 40 languages locally on your device.\n\nMicrosoft isn't alone in its AI PC ambitions. Dell and Lenovo also recently debuted their AI-first PC computers under the Copilot + AI umbrella. This is an emerging category that experts widely believe will be the next stage in computing. (Copilot+ is the name of the hardware series that supports Copilot software.)\n\nNext month, Apple is expected to announce new AI-powered tools for iPhone and Mac at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference.\n\nJeff Blaver, CEO of CCS Insight, told CNN that AI capabilities will become commonplace over time, but Microsoft and its partners are off to a solid start. They will need to work hard to ensure that AI becomes more capable than just meaningless explanations.\n\nMicrosoft's advances come at a time when the PC market is ripe for innovation.\n\nJitesh Ubrani, research manager at market research firm IDC, said the Surface product line is a relatively small part of the overall PC market, but it's an ambitious brand and is a frontrunner in terms of innovation. That's what it means. But Microsoft's move is more reflective of a larger shift toward AI happening in the industry.\n\nIn June, Apple may introduce generative AI artificial intelligence that can create new output from images to text across iOS and Mac platforms. According to reports, the company could unveil an AI-powered chatbot powered by OpenAIs ChatGPT technology, the same technology that powers Microsoft's new CoPilot+ line.\n\nStill, Microsoft has already established itself as an early leader in this space by integrating ChatGPT into its core products. And it looks like their efforts are bearing fruit.\n\nMicrosoft last month reported quarterly profit of $21.9 billion, up from $18.3 billion a year earlier. Sales increased 17% from the previous year to $61.9 billion. Microsoft's Azure cloud business also saw strong growth, with revenue up 31% on the back of AI tailwinds.\n\nThe company continues to focus on AI in other ways as well. Earlier this month, Microsoft announced it would build a $3.3 billion data hub in Wisconsin to educate employees and manufacturers on how to best use AI. According to Microsoft, the new center aims to create 2,300 construction union jobs and 2,000 permanent jobs in the long term. The company also plans to use the center to educate about 100,000 workers across the state.\n\nMicrosoft is scheduled to announce more AI-related updates at its Build conference, which starts at noon Eastern time on Tuesday.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Surface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_365", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft 365"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Outlook", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Outlook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft PowerPoint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Data_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Data Group"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-05-01t084616z-2009033034-rc2fh7akbk4p-rtrmadp-3-microsoft-thailand.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Recall feature allows natural language searches of PC activities with privacy controls and no data sent off-device. Copilot+ brings exclusive Windows Studio Effects and Cocreator for intuitive, next-level AI PC experiences.\n\nThe era of AI PCs is officially here, which is contrary to the tail end of 2023 when AI PCs were officially here. Unlike the ones we saw then, these new ones have NPUs that will get you 45 trillion operations per second (TOPS), and Microsoft is branding them as Copilot+.\n\nCopilot+ is all about bringing AI from the cloud to your device, and I already know what you're thinking. \"Why should I care about this?\" I've talked to numerous companies about this, because it's fine that you don't care. Computers are a tool, and saying you should use them differently is like telling someone that there's a better way to swing a hammer.\n\nMy advice to them has been to just sell someone a great PC, and delight them with the experiences they discover. After trying Copilot+, I think that's exactly what's going to happen. This is an inflection point for PCs, and it's OK if you don't think it's for you.\n\nRelated The future of Windows is Copilot+, and right now, it runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon Microsoft has unveiled its vision for AI PCs, and it's called Copilot+ Trying out Copilot+ Recall\n\nRecall seems to be the hero feature of Copilot+, and for good reason. It gives you a timeline of everything that you've done on your PC and lets you go back to it, but if that sounds a whole lot like Windows Timeline in Windows 10, don't worry. It's so much better than that.\n\nIt not only has a timeline of things you've done, but it's totally searchable. Speaking with Microsoft Technical Fellow Stevie Bathiche, he mentioned to me that it's a little crazy that it's always been way easier to search the internet than it is to search our own PCs.\n\nWith Recall, you can use natural language to ask for something. For example, let's say you can't remember the name of someone you were speaking with on a meeting. You can ask Recall for the person wearing a red shirt on the last Teams call you were on. If you're looking for a photo, you can ask for that picture of yourself wearing a baseball cap at the Empire State Building. You get the idea. AI can get context from things you're doing, and it's searchable.\n\nDevelopers don't have to do anything either, another thing that differentiates Recall from Windows Timeline. It's using AI to recognize things, so there's no API that the app needs to call.\n\nIt's really cool, and it's all running on-device. None of those snapshots of what you're doing are sent to servers anywhere. Moreover, Bathiche talked to me about how Microsoft put a lot of thought into privacy and user trust. You have pretty complete control over it.\n\nFor one thing, you can control how much data it can store, starting at 25GB, which I'm told is good for around three months. You can pause it, in case you don't want whatever you're doing to be saved to Recall, and you can choose apps to be excluded from being saved.\n\nWindows Studio Effects\n\nWindows Studio Effects is the original AI PC feature, debuting back in 2019 with the Surface Pro X. Over time, Microsoft added features like the ability to blur your background, gaze correction, auto reframe, and noise cancelation to the suite. My question has always been, why do I need my device to do background blur when Google Meet does it for me anyway?\n\nIt always felt like a way to say, \"Hey, we have an NPU and it can do things. Here's an example.\" Moving forward, it was something that Qualcomm boasted because Intel couldn't do it. Some Intel PCs shipped with it and the results were awful in the products I tested. It wasn't until Intel Core Ultra shipped that Windows Studio Effects could run in full on x86 hardware.\n\nFor Copilot+, Windows Studio Effects is getting some new features. There's a new portrait light feature, which is different from background blur. There are also new animations, like illustrated, animated, and watercolor, which make you look more like a drawing.\n\nAll of these new features are exclusive to Copilot+, so you'll need a 40+ TOPS NPU to get them.\n\nLive Captions\n\nThere isn't too much I can say on Live Captions. Basically, you can take any video or live feed and add captions to it. It can do translations too, as you can see in the photos. The person demoing the feature playfully noted that I'll have to trust him that it was translating correctly.\n\nCocreator\n\nWhen Microsoft first announced Cocreator, it seemed like just another image generator, but the 'co' prefix really does mean something here. Living inside Paint, it's actually working with you to create images.\n\nCombining a prompt and a drawing, it's using AI to make images based on what it thinks you want. We were creating a city, and made a prompt as such, along with a crude drawing of the outlines of some buildings. Cocreator got to work making that city.\n\nAs you add to it, Cocreator continues to work on the image that it thinks you want. We added a yellow circle for the sun and a crude drawing of the space needle. We adjusted the prompt to say we were trying to draw Seattle, and the image adjusted.\n\nMicrosoft says that this is all about giving the people the tools you need to do what you want to do. Maybe you have the creativity to draw but you don't have the talent. Corcreator can help you along the way.\n\nCopilot+ is good for everyone\n\nMost of what we'd seen for AI PCs so far has been about Windows Studio Effects, which weren't too exciting. Third-party developers have introduced some things, but you sort of have to already be invested in those to care.\n\nCopilot+ is that and way more. It's a mission to make your PC smarter, so it can just do things you haven't done before, but in an intuitive way.\n\nNo one is going to force you to use your new laptop differently. But one day, you might be looking for some photo you took in some random place, and without remembering where that place was, you'll be able to describe some things you remember from the picture, and you'll be able to find it. These little things are what make computers better.", "source": {"uri": "xda-developers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "XDA-Developers"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOPS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TOPS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Pro_X", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surface Pro X"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Windows 10"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_State_Building", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Empire State Building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Meet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google Meet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "X86"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel Core"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/05/microsoft-copilot-plus-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Like the new-age Mac with Apple M-series silicon, Microsoft's new Copilot Plus PCs run ARM-based mobile processors, more precisely Qualcomm's freshly minted Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus platforms. Microsoft's previous attempts at launching ARM-based computers were held back by limited app support and in many cases, poor battery life. With the new Copilot Plus PCs, it is promising to fix both these long-standing issues. Plus, it's investing heavily on bringing \"on-device\" AI for quick response and better privacy.\n\nAnyhow, Microsoft claims its new Copilot Plus PCs are up to 20 times more powerful and 100 times more efficient at running AI workloads. It's being rather specific while making performance comparisons saying they \"outperform\" Apple's MacBook Air 15 (M3) by up to 58 percent in sustained multithreaded performance, all while providing all-day battery life. Copilot+ PCs can deliver up to 22 hours of local video playback or 15 hours of web browsing on a single charge, Microsoft says, which is 20 percent more battery life for local video playback than the MacBook Air 15.\n\nMicrosoft Copilot Plus PCs -- Everything to know\n\nIt's complimenting all that power and efficiency gains with \"more native Arm64 experiences than ever before,\" including the fastest implementation of Microsoft 365 apps like Teams, PowerPoint, Outlook, Word, Excel, OneDrive, and OneNote. Popular applications such as Chrome, Spotify, Zoom, WhatsApp, Blender, Affinity Suite, and DaVinci Resolve now run natively on Arm while apps like Slack are set to release later this year. In a big win, Microsoft has also successfully courted Adobe to make its flagship apps including Photoshop, Lightroom, and Express, fully compatible with Copilot Plus PCs on day one while Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and more will follow this summer. It also has its own version of Apple's Rosetta 2 called Prism to ensure that all apps run smoothly, whether they are native or emulated.\n\nAI being the hot buzzword, Microsoft is specifically going for on-device AI that works in tandem with the on-board NPU and its small language models (SLMs) to facilitate a wide range of conveniences.\n\nWith a new feature called \"Recall,\" users can access virtually everything they've seen or done on their PC in a way that feels like \"having photographic memory.\" Copilot Plus PCs organise information based on relationships and associations unique to each user's experiences, helping them remember and find what they're looking for quickly and intuitively using the cues they remember. Microsoft says Recall leverages a personal semantic index, built and stored entirely on the device. Snapshots remain local to the PC and can be managed by the user. Individual snapshots can be deleted, and time ranges can be adjusted or deleted in Settings. Users can pause Recall at any point from the System Tray icon on the Taskbar and filter apps and websites from being saved.\n\nFollow FE Tech Bytes on Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook.\n\nIn Paint and Photos, users can combine ink strokes with text prompts to generate new images in real time with \"Cocreator.\" Photo editing and image creation are meanwhile taken to the next level with Restyle Image, allowing users to reimagine personal photos with new styles by combining image generation and photo editing in Photos.

Local processing improves data privacy, speeds up responses and works reliably even without an internet connection.\n\nDeveloped in collaboration with chipmakers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), these AI-powered PCs feature neural processing units that can deliver 40 tera operations per second, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage, the company reportedly said at a closed media event a day ahead of its annual Build developers conference. At the same time, Dell has announced the release of AI business hardware.\n\nThe move toward local AI processing on personal computers marks a notable shift in the industry. As AI applications become more prevalent, there is a growing need to address issues such as data privacy and performance bottlenecks associated with cloud-based processing. By equipping PCs with dedicated hardware for AI tasks, Microsoft aims to provide users with a more secure and efficient computing experience.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen how well these machines will perform in real-world scenarios and whether they will justify the potentially higher costs associated with the advanced hardware.\n\nAt the heart of the Copilot+ experience is a suite of AI-powered features integrated into Windows 11. The \"Recall\" feature allows users to retrieve information using natural language prompts, while \"Super Resolution\" can enhance the quality of old photos in Windows Photos. Live Captions offers real-time captioning and translations in over 40 languages, and a dedicated Copilot app provides a versatile workspace for AI-assisted tasks.\n\nThe Verge and Engadget reported that the Copilot+ PCs are now open for pre-orders on Microsoft.com and at leading global retailers. The devices are set to hit the market next, with prices starting at $999. Major OEMs like Lenovo, Samsung, Acer, ASUS, Dell and HP are all set to launch their own Copilot+ models, including the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7X, ThinkPad 14S, Acer Swift 14a, ASUS Vivobook S15 and several Dell models, including a new XPS 13.\n\nDell announced its new line of Copilot+ PCs, powered by Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus processors, as part of its expanding AI devices and infrastructure offerings. The company said these new devices will transform the AI PC experience with improved performance, battery life and security features, marking a significant step in the AI PC revolution.\n\nThe new lineup includes five laptops -- the XPS 13, Inspiron 14 Plus, Inspiron 14, Latitude 7455 and Latitude 5455 -- catering to consumer and commercial markets. The standout feature of these devices is their ability to process AI tasks locally without relying on an internet connection or the cloud.\n\nThis on-device processing is made possible by the custom-integrated Qualcomm Oryon CPU, premium GPU and neural processing unit (NPU), which Dell said can deliver up to 45 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of performance. The company also highlighted the laptops' extended battery life, with the XPS 13 offering up to 27 hours and the Latitude 7455 providing up to 21 hours on a single charge.\n\nMicrosoft also unveiled a new Surface Pro Copilot+ PC, an Arm-powered device that the company claims will not compromise on performance. Thanks to a re-architected version of Windows 11, Microsoft said these machines are 58% faster than \"the fastest MacBook Air\" with an M3 processor. The new Surface Pro will feaeture an OLED screen and a redesigned Flex Keyboard, though pricing details for the keyboard accessory have yet to be revealed.\n\nThe Verge reported that Microsoft plans to welcome Intel and AMD chips into the Copilot+ platform soon, further expanding the range of Copilot+ PCs from leading OEMs. Engadget also highlighted some AI-powered features demonstrated on the new Surface Pro, such as background removal and dynamic background addition in video clips using CapCut, which the Surface Pro can handle almost three times faster than the previous Pro 9 model. The new \"Cocreator\" feature in Image Creator allows users to draw a basic outline and combine it with a text prompt to generate a final AI image, all processed on-device.\n\nAs Microsoft takes a partner-first approach to this new era of computing, the question remains: Will Copilot+ PCs live up to their bold promises and revolutionize how we interact with our devices? Only time -- and real-world testing -- will tell.\n\nIn related AI hardware news, Dell and Nvidia announced on Monday a significant expansion of their collaboration, the Dell AI Factory with Nvidia. The partnership aims to provide businesses with a comprehensive suite of AI-focused servers, edge computing solutions, workstations and services designed to streamline the implementation of AI and drive innovation across industries.\n\nCentral to the expanded offering is the new Dell PowerEdge XE9680L server, which can support eight Nvidia Blackwell GPUs and provide 33% more GPU density per node than previous models. The server also features direct liquid cooling for improved efficiency and is designed for easy serviceability, making it an attractive option for organizations looking to deploy large-scale AI projects.\n\nAdditionally, Dell and Nvidia unveiled new AI solutions, including the Dell NativeEdge edge orchestration platform, which automates the delivery of Nvidia AI Enterprise software, and the Dell Generative AI Solution for Digital Assistants, which aims to accelerate the deployment of personalized, AI-powered experience for end users.", "source": {"uri": "pymnts.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PYMNTS.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internet access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Original equipment manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surface Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_XPS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dell XPS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Inspiron", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dell Inspiron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo_Yoga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo Yoga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swift (programming language)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ThinkPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Microsoft-Windows11-AI-artificial-intelligence.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 442, "textEnd": 448}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Here's what to expect.", "body": "Microsoft is expected to unveil updates on Copilot, Azure, and its Surface lineup this week. Analysts say Microsoft's AI and cloud innovations are underestimated by the stock market. Wedbush analysts projected that Microsoft's AI tools could generate $25-$30 billion in revenue by 2025.\n\nIt's about to be a big week for Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft is in the spotlight as it follows major announcements from OpenAI and Google last week and prepares to unveil its latest AI innovations at Build, the company's annual developer conference.\n\nThe tech giant is also holding an exclusive event for journalists on Monday detailing its vision for hardware, which will likely feature its new Surface lineup along with some software updates.\n\nThe next day is the main event, Microsoft's Build keynote, where it's expected to announce updates to its AI assistant Copilot and cloud computing platform Azure, along with other Windows features.\n\nWedbush analysts said in a Monday note that they believe Microsoft's AI and cloud advancements have been underestimated by the stock market -- but Microsoft tools like Copilot will be a major source of revenue growth that could generate between $25 and $30 billion for Microsoft by its fiscal year 2025.\n\nAccording to Dan Ives, Wedbush's managing director and senior equity analyst, Microsoft's big week is expected to be all about three things -- here's what's expected to be front and center.\n\nCopilot and other AI features in Windows\n\nWedbush analysts expect Microsoft to roll out more Copilot and AI features into its consumer and enterprise product stack.\n\nWedbush said in its analyst note that it expects more AI integration with Microsoft apps like Excel, Teams, and Word, which will increase subscriptions and strengthen Microsoft's consumer base.\n\nOver 70% of Microsoft's installed base \"will ultimately be on this AI-driven functionality\" in the next three years, the analyst said, which will be a big change for the company.\n\nIves said putting AI features into Windows will give developers the foundation to build AI use cases through Windows and, ultimately, Azure.\n\nShowcasing AI framework in Azure\n\nIves said in some ways, the most important aspect of the developer conference is going to be showing off the AI framework in Azure.\n\nIn its analyst note, Wedbush estimated that Microsoft's customers still have plenty of room to increase their spending with the company. For every $100 they spend on Azure, there is an estimated $35-$40 in potential additional AI spending, they wrote.\n\n\"Cloud is where the battleground is between Google, Oracle, Amazon,\" Ives said. \"Microsoft is showing developers to look no further than between us and OpenAI.\"\n\nSurface Updates\n\nWedbush analysts anticipate new laptops along with Windows updates this week.\n\nThe new hardware expected to be announced on Monday, the day before Build kicks off, could include the Surface Pro 10 and the Surface Laptop 6, The Verge reports. Both would run on Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite processors as the company transitions to Arm, The Verge said.\n\nNew processors would come as Microsoft and other PC companies have been under pressure to ramp up their processing chips since Apple transitioned to creating its own. Recent reports also indicate that Apple is working on revamping its entire Mac lineup with a series of new M4 processors that aim to put AI at their center.\n\nBut Microsoft's Surface updates may kick off the trend. Ives said the new AI Surface updates will start a new PC-driven cycle that's \"AI-led, from Dell to Microsoft, and ultimately to Apple as well.\"\n\nExpect it to be a 'showstopper'\n\nMicrosoft has big shoes to fill following OpenAI's spring update and Google's I/O conference last week. Both companies announced human-like updates to their AI products, showcasing their AI agent's ability to respond to prompts with voice and act as a tutor.\n\nGoogle also announced a revamped search engine integrated with AI, which competes with Microsft's AI-powered Bing.\n\nBut according to Ives, Microsoft will be a \"showstopper.\" Due to OpenAI's collaboration with Microsoft, Ives said the conference will build on OpenAI's announcements from last week.\n\nBusiness Insider will be liveblogging Microsoft's big opening keynote on Tuesday at 12 p.m. ET, so check back with us then to follow along.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_altchek@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Ana Altchek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Excel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Surface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "output"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Update", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windows Update"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/65fad211895d82203032773f?format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Copilot+ PCs will be able to handle some AI-accelerated workloads like chatbots and image generation locally instead of relying on the cloud, but new hardware will generally be required to run these workloads quickly and power efficiently.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nAt a minimum, systems will need 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, to accommodate both the memory requirements and the on-disk storage requirements needed for things like large language models (LLMs; even so-called \"small language models\" like Microsoft's Phi-3, still use several billion parameters). Microsoft says that all of the Snapdragon X Plus and Elite-powered PCs being announced today will come with the Copilot+ features pre-installed, and that they'll begin shipping on June 18th.\n\nBut the biggest new requirement, and the blocker for virtually every Windows PC in use today, will be for an integrated neural processing unit, or NPU. Microsoft requires an NPU with performance rated at 40 trillion operations per second (TOPS), a high-level performance figure that Microsoft, Qualcomm, Apple, and others use for NPU performance comparisons. Right now, that requirement can only be met by a single chip in the Windows PC ecosystem, one that isn't even quite available yet: Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus, launching in the new Surface and a number of PCs from the likes of Dell, Lenovo, HP, Asus, Acer, and other major PC OEMs in the next couple of months. All of those chips have NPUs capable of 45 TOPS, just a shade more than Microsoft's minimum requirement.\n\nThe problem for Intel and AMD is that none of their current-generation chips come anywhere close to meeting this requirement, even the ones that have NPUs in the first place -- Intel's Meteor Lake-based Core Ultra NPUs top out (ha) at 10 TOPS, and a handful of AMD's Ryzen 7000 and Ryzen 8000 desktop and laptop processors with NPUs offer between 12 and 16 TOPS. This is particularly embarrassing for Intel, which for decades has been so synonymous with Windows PCs that their portmanteau has a fairly thorough Wikipedia entry.\n\nBoth Intel and AMD have products on their roadmap that will boost NPU performance to the level that Microsoft is asking for with Copilot+ PCs, but none of the hundreds of millions of active x86-based Windows PCs, up to and including models you can buy today, will qualify for the label.\n\nNPUs that meet Microsoft's Copilot+ PC requirement will be used to power (among other things) a group of features that Microsoft is calling \"Recall,\" a collection of AI features that will try to make helpful suggestions by keeping track of everything you've done on your PC, including attending meetings, opening files, and doing web searches. Perhaps aware of the fact that this sounds like a privacy and security nightmare, Microsoft EVP Yusuf Medhi says that the NPU will handle all of this processing locally, allowing user data to stay \"private, local, and secure on just the device.\" On a Copilot+ PC with the minimum 256GB SSD, Microsoft says Recall will take up about 25GB of disk space and store around three months' worth of events.\n\nIntel and AMD's CPUs and GPUs can also contribute to the total number of TOPS that any given system can perform. But NPUs are specialized hardware, made to run AI workloads more quickly and while using less power. You could use a CPU to render 3D games or other workloads, but you typically wouldn't; you'd leave that work to the GPU. Dedicated video encoding and decoding hardware allows slow, dirt-cheap ARM processors in Roku boxes or Fire sticks to play back 4K video streams. The NPU fills a similar role for AI workloads -- it's not dishonest to put out TOPS figures that bundle the CPU, GPU, and NPU together, but achieving that level of performance using a CPU and GPU means using a lot more power and reducing battery life.\n\nMicrosoft sees Copilot+ PCs as \"premium\" devices that exist above older Windows PCs or Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm-powered systems with lower-performance NPUs. Windows 11's core system requirements aren't changing, and all of the cloud-powered AI features (and existing NPU-accelerated workloads like Windows Studio Effects for webcams) will continue to work on existing PCs as they currently do.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThere's risk for Microsoft in tying the Copilot+ PC branding to the Arm version of Windows in all of these launch devices. Though compatibility has gotten dramatically better in just the last couple of years, and though Windows 11 24H2's new Prism emulation layer improves app translation speeds by as much as 20 percent compared to Windows 11 23H2 running on the same hardware, there are still some compatibility gaps where Arm-based Windows PCs won't be able to do the same things that an Intel or AMD PC can. Hardware that requires specialized drivers is one sticking point; games that require the installation of anti-cheat software are another.\n\nCopilot+ PCs could be a new phase in the PC's development, one that we eventually look back on as an inflection point. They could also be Windows RT all over again, a trend-chasing flash-in-the-pan that comes and goes without making a dent in the Wintel monolith.", "source": {"uri": "arstechnica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ars Technica"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_cunningham@arstechnica.com", "name": "Andrew Cunningham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhood_planning_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neighborhood planning unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wikipedia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Original equipment manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ARM architecture family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/copilot-plus-760x380.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 1058, "textEnd": 1067}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

At Microsoft Build, we saw the first wave of PCs using those chips announced -- and what kinds of AI features Microsoft wants them to empower.\n\nMicrosoft rebranded its AI PCs as Copilot Plus PCs after its Copilot generative AI software assistant, the first of which are variants of the Surface Laptop 6 and Surface Pro powered by Snapdragon X Elite as well as the newly announced and Snapdragon X Plus chip (for lower priced devices). Acer, HP, Lenovo and Samsung unveiled laptops that will also use Qualcomm's PC chips, which will start to be available on June 18.\n\nMicrosoft is hedging its bets, with some versions of the Surface Pro 10 and Laptop 6 that come with Intel Core Ultra chips. Regardless of which silicon is used, Microsoft is requiring all Copilot PCs to run at least 40 trillion operations per second neural processing units, the industry's current metric for AI computation performance, and some of the laptops using Qualcomm's chips pushed 45 trillion operations per second. Copilot PCs must also pack at least 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.\n\nWith Qualcomm's chips, Microsoft says its Surface Pro laptop is 90% faster than the Surface Pro 9 and the Snapdragon X-series' integrated NPU \"delivers almost 20% more TOPS for AI processing than the Apple iPad Pro M4,\" according to Microsoft's press release.\n\nBack in October, Qualcomm claimed its X Elite chip could reach 75 TOPS in bursts with sustained calculations at 45 TOPS, so these performance metrics are in line with expectations.\n\nPower efficiency was another part of Qualcomm's initial pitch for its X-series chips, though the company had been coy about how long of battery life we could expect from PCs using its silicon, since that could vary with different manufacturers and configurations.\n\nBut now that the initial first- and third-party Copilot PC lineup has been announced with broad specs, we have a better idea of estimated battery life with Qualcomm's PC chips: 17 hours with the Microsoft Surface Pro and 18 hours with the ASUS Vivobook S 15, up to 22 hours for the Microsoft Surface Laptop and Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge, up to 26 hours for the HP OmniBook X AI PC/HP EliteBook Ultra AI PC and 27 hours for the Dell XPS 13 and up to 31 hours for the Lenovo ThinkPad T13S Gen 6.\n\nFor battery, the Snapdragon X-series laptops are around or beyond the battery capabilities of the latest MacBook Pro with an M3 chip released toward the end of last year -- which lasted around 18 hours in our testing. (Apple gives a 15- to 22-hour battery life depending on activity.)\n\nBut performance is another factor in the Snapdragon X-series versus Apple M3 and M4 rivalry that we won't be sure of until we can benchmark all those Windows 11 laptops. At Snapdragon Summit, Qualcomm claimed its new chips would outperform Apple, though the company had only data on the then-latest M2 chips on hand when it was drawing up comparison charts.", "source": {"uri": "cnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNET"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surface Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Silicon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartwatch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartwatch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surface Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel Core"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/350e92a53e5a9504b44640f74a2f322e329da881/hub/2023/10/24/232951e6-2c74-45c5-ba31-3d98824bd437/snapdragon-x-elite-lifestyle.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 847, "textEnd": 854}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Here's what to expect.", "body": "Microsoft is hosting its annual Build developers conference on Tuesday.Ethan Miller\n\nIt's about to be a big week for Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft is in the spotlight as it follows major announcements from OpenAI and Google last week and prepares to unveil its latest AI innovations at Build, the company's annual developer conference.\n\nThe tech giant is also holding an exclusive event for journalists on Monday detailing its vision for hardware, which will likely feature its new Surface lineup along with some software updates.\n\nThe next day is the main event, Microsoft's Build keynote, where it's expected to announce updates to its AI assistant Copilot and cloud computing platform Azure, along with other Windows features.\n\nWedbush analysts said in a Monday note that they believe Microsoft's AI and cloud advancements have been underestimated by the stock market -- but Microsoft tools like Copilot will be a major source of revenue growth that could generate between $25 and $30 billion for Microsoft by its fiscal year 2025.\n\nAccording to Dan Ives, Wedbush's managing director and senior equity analyst, Microsoft's big week is expected to be all about three things -- here's what's expected to be front and center.\n\nCopilot and other AI features in Windows\n\nWedbush analysts expect Microsoft to roll out more Copilot and AI features into its consumer and enterprise product stack.\n\nWedbush said in its analyst note that it expects more AI integration with Microsoft apps like Excel, Teams, and Word, which will increase subscriptions and strengthen Microsoft's consumer base.\n\nOver 70% of Microsoft's installed base \"will ultimately be on this AI-driven functionality\" in the next three years, the analyst said, which will be a big change for the company.\n\nIves said putting AI features into Windows will give developers the foundation to build AI use cases through Windows and, ultimately, Azure.\n\nShowcasing AI framework in Azure\n\nIves said in some ways, the most important aspect of the developer conference is going to be showing off the AI framework in Azure.\n\nIn its analyst note, Wedbush estimated that Microsoft's customers still have plenty of room to increase their spending with the company. For every $100 they spend on Azure, there is an estimated $35-$40 in potential additional AI spending, they wrote.\n\n\"Cloud is where the battleground is between Google, Oracle, Amazon,\" Ives said. \"Microsoft is showing developers to look no further than between us and OpenAI.\"\n\nSurface Updates\n\nWedbush analysts anticipate new laptops along with Windows updates this week.\n\nThe new hardware expected to be announced on Monday, the day before Build kicks off, could include the Surface Pro 10 and the Surface Laptop 6, The Verge reports. Both would run on Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite processors as the company transitions to Arm, The Verge said.\n\nNew processors would come as Microsoft and other PC companies have been under pressure to ramp up their processing chips since Apple transitioned to creating its own. Recent reports also indicate that Apple is working on revamping its entire Mac lineup with a series of new M4 processors that aim to put AI at their center.\n\nBut Microsoft's Surface updates may kick off the trend. Ives said the new AI Surface updates will start a new PC-driven cycle that's \"AI-led, from Dell to Microsoft, and ultimately to Apple as well.\"\n\nExpect it to be a 'showstopper'\n\nMicrosoft has big shoes to fill following OpenAI's spring update and Google's I/O conference last week. Both companies announced human-like updates to their AI products, showcasing their AI agent's ability to respond to prompts with voice and act as a tutor.\n\nGoogle also announced a revamped search engine integrated with AI, which competes with Microsft's AI-powered Bing.\n\nBut according to Ives, Microsoft will be a \"showstopper.\" Due to OpenAI's collaboration with Microsoft, Ives said the conference will build on OpenAI's announcements from last week.\n\nBusiness Insider will be liveblogging Microsoft's big opening keynote on Tuesday at 12 p.m. ET, so check back with us then to follow along.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_altchek@businessinsider.in", "name": "Ana Altchek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Excel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Surface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "output"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Update", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windows Update"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office_Suites", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office Suites", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/110281257/microsoft-is-about-to-show-off-its-next-move-in-ai-heres-what-to-expect-.jpg?imgsize=301972", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The conference, set for May 21 and May 23, is named Microsoft Build 2024. The conference will be held in Seattle, as well as held virtually.\n\nConsidering the current trend in the tech community of AI, the conference is likely to focus on the AI developments by Microsoft; in addition, expected updates on Windows 11 and new Surface hardware will be provided.\n\nIt will cost USD 2,125 to attend in person in Seattle, and the virtual conference is free. Starting from 9 pm, May 21, the conference will go live on the Microsoft Developer YouTube channel. The opening keynote will be presented by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Rajesh Jha, Mustafa Suleyman, and Kevin Scott. It is anticipated that they will announce new developer tools in the market and the upcoming hardware.\n\nThe official Microsoft announcement for the event date reads, \"Build is coming up soon - it takes place from May 21-23, 2024. Whether you'll be attending in person in Seattle or joining us online - for free - you'll be living and breathing the cutting-edge creations of our developer tools and technologies that Microsoft is continually introducing to the world.\"\n\nFurthermore, one might say that the Microsoft Build 2024 conference's theme: \"How will AI shape your future?\" alludes to the tremendous importance of Microsoft's strategy to fuse AI across all of its products. The most significant announcements on the theme will be new AI capabilities of Windows and Office, possibly such as the new version of Copilot with Windows 11 and an \"AI Explorer\" that will be able to integrate and interact with one's digital environments in unprecedented ways.\n\nMicrosoft will also announce new Azure cloud platform products and solutions at Build 2024 for developers but include improved low-code and no-code capabilities; these tools will allow developers to create with AI in new ways, continuing to grow Microsoft's AI ecosystem.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft will also decimate some new hardware at Build 2024, including Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6, both available in x86-based and ARM-based models, expanding its ARM-powered PC lineup further.

The company believes it has finally perfected the transition to Arm chips, dedicating an entire day to showcasing its new hardware against the MacBook Air.\n\nAt a recent event at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington, developers presented new Surface devices equipped with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chips, directly comparing them to Apple's leading laptop. During an hour of demos and benchmarks, starting with Geekbench and Cinebench comparisons and progressing to app performance and compatibility tests, the Surface devices consistently outperformed the competition.\n\nThe MacBook Air has historically outpaced Arm-powered PC chips and even Intel-based ones. However, this time, the Surface devices led the way in every test. The consistent wins in these benchmarks underpin Microsoft's belief that it is now positioned to dominate the laptop market.\n\nOver the past two years, Microsoft has collaborated secretly with its top laptop partners to prepare a lineup of Arm-powered Windows machines set to launch this summer. Dubbed Copilot Plus PCs, these devices aim to usher in a generation of powerful, battery-efficient Windows laptops and pave the way for an AI-driven future.\n\n\"You're going to have the most powerful PC ever. In fact, it's going to outperform any device out there, including a MacBook Air with an M3 processor, by over 50 percent on sustained performance,\" said Yusuf Mehdi, executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer at Microsoft, during the briefing.\n\nWindows laptops have lagged significantly behind MacBooks in terms of performance and battery life since Apple's transition to its own M1 chips in 2020. This context makes Microsoft's current confidence quite surprising, especially considering its troubled history with Windows on Arm over the past decade.\n\nMicrosoft's initial attempt with the Surface RT in 2012 suffered from poor performance and lack of app compatibility. The launch of the Surface Pro X in 2019 marked an improvement due to better emulation and changes to Windows, but it still couldn't match Apple's M1 launch shortly thereafter. However, it hinted at a promising future, fueled by a growing partnership with Qualcomm that now seems poised to bear fruit.\n\nBasically, everything Microsoft demonstrated in terms of performance and battery life appears to be significantly ahead of previous Arm-powered Windows laptops.\n\nOne major advancement is an improved emulator called Prism, which Microsoft claims matches the efficiency of Apple's Rosetta 2 translation layer and can emulate apps twice as fast as previous generations of Windows on Arm devices.\n\nThis should yield efficiency gains over the previous emulator, though Microsoft is cautious with its promises. Nonetheless, emulation can only go so far. Apple's success with the M1 was largely due to developers quickly porting their apps to run natively. For Windows to achieve similar success, it will need robust support from its developer community.\n\nFortunately for Microsoft, two significant shifts have occurred in recent years.\n\nFirst, many major applications now natively support Arm chips. Apps like Photoshop, Dropbox, Zoom, Spotify, and popular entertainment platforms such as Prime Video and Hulu have all become ARM64 native.\n\nSecond, Google and various other browser developers are transitioning to ARM64. A native version of Chrome was recently released, followed by Opera just last week. Additionally, browsers like Firefox, Vivaldi, Brave, and Microsoft Edge are all ARM64 native, ensuring that users won't experience any performance loss in their browsers. This is crucial given the prevalence of web-based applications and the increasing amount of time we spend in browsers.\n\nMicrosoft is optimistic that 87 percent of total app usage time on these Copilot Plus PCs will be within native apps. It is actively working to bridge the remaining 13 percent, with the Prism emulator providing support in the interim.\n\nHowever, all this app compatibility and performance mean little without substantial battery life. Microsoft ran a web browsing simulation to test battery efficiency.\n\nOn the Intel-based Surface Laptop 5 from 2022, the battery lasted eight hours and 38 minutes.\n\nIn contrast, the new Surface Copilot Plus PC lasted an impressive 16 hours and 56 minutes, effectively doubling the battery life. This significant increase in efficiency even surpasses the performance of a 15-inch MacBook Air M3, which lasted 15 hours and 25 minutes in the same test, giving the Surface Copilot Plus PC an advantage of an additional hour and a half.\n\nIn a similar video playback test, the Surface Copilot Plus PC achieved over 20 hours of battery life, compared to 17 hours and 45 minutes for the MacBook Air M3. This is also nearly eight hours more than the Surface Laptop 5, which lasted 12 hours and 30 minutes. If these battery gains extend beyond basic web browsing and video playback, this development could mark a significant improvement for Windows laptops.\n\nAI Integration\n\nThe Copilot Plus PCs are equipped with Qualcomm's neural processing unit (NPU), which delivers 45 TOPS (trillions of operations per second) for AI tasks. This allows for more AI task operations per watt than both the MacBook Air M3 and Nvidia's RTX 4060.\n\nMicrosoft is integrating over 40 AI models directly into Windows on Arm to enable new experiences within the operating system and for app developers. Approximately 10 of these models are small language models running in the background, allowing developers to embed AI experiences directly into their apps. Notably, Microsoft's battery life measurements include these models running continuously on the NPU.\n\nAdditionally, Windows 11's Live Captions feature is getting AI-powered live translations, providing real-time translation for any video. Microsoft is also introducing Auto Super Resolution to Windows 11, which automatically upscales games to enhance frame rates and graphics resolution.\n\nAlthough these AI features in Windows are in their early stages, Microsoft has built a new kernel and compiler tailored for Arm-based chips. This overhaul at the core of Windows on Arm aims to make the system more responsive and unlock a new wave of AI features and applications.\n\nMajor manufacturers including Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung are all launching new Copilot Plus PCs, initially shipping with Qualcomm processors. If Microsoft's demonstrations hold up in real-world testing, this could be a monumental moment for Windows laptops, comparable in impact to a major new release of Windows itself.", "source": {"uri":

The company hopes the new machines will boost sales and revive excitement, particularly as AI is expected to become increasingly part of everyday life.\n\nMicrosoft's new lineup of Copilot+ PCs, which feature a new Surface Pro tablet and Surface laptop, include AI tools that don't require internet connection - the AI processing occurs directly on the device\n\nThe new hardware plays up its existing AI assistant called Copilot, which works across various products, including Bing and Microsoft 365. It can help with tasks such as writing, keeping track of emails in Outlook or designing presentations in PowerPoint.\n\nOne new feature, called Recall, acts as a personal \"time machine,\" allowing users to quickly find things from their computer, such as documents, images and websites. Another allows for real-time translation into more than 40 more languages locally on the device.\n\nMicrosoft isn't alone in its AI PC ambition. Dell and Lenovo also recently debuted AI-first PC computers under the Copilot+ AI umbrella, an emerging category that experts widely believe will become the next stage of computing. (Copilot+ is the name of the line of hardware that supports the Copilot software.)\n\nNext month, Apple is expected to announce new AI-powered tools for the iPhone and Mac at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference.\n\n\"Over time, AI capability will become a ubiquitous feature, but Microsoft and its partners have made a solid start,\" Geoff Blaber, CEO at CCS Insight, told CNN. \"They will need to work hard to ensure that AI becomes a lot more than just a meaningless descriptor with a growing number of features.\"\n\nMicrosoft's advancements also come at a time when the PC market is ripe for innovation.\n\n\"This is a much-needed catalyst,\" Blaber added.\n\nAlthough the Surface line is relatively small within the overall PC market, it serves as an aspirational brand and a frontrunner in terms of innovation, according to Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager at market research firm IDC. But Microsoft's move is more reflective of a greater shift happening in the industry toward AI.\n\nIn June, Apple will likely introduce generative AI - artificial intelligence that is capable of creating new output from images to text - across its iOS and Mac platforms. Reports indicate the company could unveil an AI-powered chatbot that runs on OpenAI's ChatGPT technology, the same technology that underpins Microsoft's new CoPilot+ line.\n\nStill, Microsoft has already established itself as an early leader in this space with ChatGPT integrated into key products. And it appears those efforts are paying off.\n\nLast month, Microsoft reported quarterly profits of $21.9 billion, up from $18.3 billion a year ago. Revenue grew 17% year-over-year growth to $61.9 billion. Microsoft's Azure cloud business also experienced strong growth - revenue grew 31% - boosted by AI tailwinds.\n\nThe company continues to go all in on AI in other ways, too. Earlier this month, Microsoft said it is pouring $3.3 billion into building a data hub in Wisconsin to train employees and manufacturers on how to best use artificial intelligence. The new center aims to create 2,300 union construction jobs and 2,000 permanent jobs over time, according to Microsoft. It also plans to use the center to train about 100,000 workers across the state.\n\nMicrosoft is set to announce more AI-related updates at its Build conference starting at noon ET on Tuesday.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Lenovo, Samsung, Dell, HP, Acer, and Asus will introduce their takes on the Copilot+ PC around a month from now, all featuring either the X Elite or the slightly less powerful X Plus, which supposedly has the same AI performance as its sibling.\n\n\"I won't be fully convinced until I've spent enough time with one of these new Copilot+ PCs, but everything Microsoft showed me around performance and battery life looks lightyears ahead of the Arm-powered Windows laptops that existed before today,\" The Verge's Tom Warren cautiously enthused after a Microsoft briefing. \"If everything Microsoft showed me holds up in real-world testing, this is a monumental moment for Windows laptops -- with just as big an impact as a new release of Windows itself.\"\n\nWarren is not wrong -- this really could be a pivotal point in the PC story.\n\nIf the Copilot+ hardware push works as planned, the most obvious loser would be Apple, whose M-series chips have in recent years provided a huge selling point for MacBooks. Windows PCs being able to catch up on the power-plus-longevity front would be a huge deal for Microsoft. And if they also prove more capable at handling on-device generative AI, that would be yet another way in which Apple is struggling to keep up in the AI field. (Keeping AI on-device has privacy benefits, and is just plain faster than having to access the cloud when it comes to simple tasks like translation and summarization.)\n\nAnother big loser in this scenario is Intel, which increasingly looks like a legacy company entering its twilight years. This isn't the first time that Intel's x86 processor technology has been threatened by Arm's rival technology in the Windows PC space, but Microsoft's support for Windows on Arm has always seemed half-hearted, with developers left unsure of how much they should commit to the concept.\n\nThat doesn't seem to be the case anymore, with Microsoft enthusiastically touting buy-in from developers like Adobe and BlackMagic Design, whose products are wildly popular with the MacBook-toting creative crowd. \"Come on over to Windows; it's finally running on the kind of chip that suits your needs,\" Microsoft seems to be saying.\n\nAs for Qualcomm, the venerable chipmaker has a massive but brief window of opportunity here, as it has an exclusivity deal with Microsoft that makes it the sole provider of Arm-based processors for Windows PC, but only until the end of this year. So while its latest Snapdragon chipsets are ubiquitous in this first wave of Arm-based Copilot+ PCs, that probably won't remain the case in future waves, with the likes of Nvidia and AMD reportedly preparing to enter the fray. Qualcomm will definitely be hoping that the first wave catches the public's imagination, showing that its Snapdragon processors -- which have mostly been deployed in cheaper and less powerful laptops until now -- can shine on high-end devices.\n\nSo in short, there's a lot riding on this moment for a lot of companies.

Microsoft announced its next generation of laptops under its new Copilot Plus PC umbrella, calling them the \"fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever built.\" As Apple did years ago, Microsoft finally shifted over to ARM-based chips to power its laptops, leading to a huge boost in performance that can rival the newest MacBook Air.\n\nInstead of relying on Intel, Microsoft opted for Qualcomm's much more efficient chips. This major change has led to vastly improved laptops along with support for a number of AI functions that Apple doesn't offer yet.\n\nMicrosoft didn't pull any punches when introducing its Copilot Plus PCs. The company directly compared its next-gen laptops to the latest M3 MacBook Air, claiming it can outperform Apple \"by up to 58 percent in sustained multithread performance.\" On top of raw power, Microsoft noted that these laptops can get up to 22 hours of local video playback or 15 hours of web browsing. Again comparing it to the MacBook Air, that's 20 percent more battery life when it comes to local video playback.\n\nThat boost in performance is all thanks to Qualcomm's Snapdragon X series chips. To support this, Microsoft's Copilot Plus PCs will use an integrated neural processor and need to have at least a 256GB SSD and 16GB of RAM.\n\nBeyond beating the MacBook Air on specs alone, Microsoft wants to heavily incorporate AI features into its Copilot Plus PCs. Recall will be among Microsoft's headlining features for these AI-boosted laptops, allowing you to search for anything you've done on the device. On top of that, you'll get Live Captions which can help with translation, and Cocreator, which uses AI to enhance your photos or sketches done in Paint. Microsoft's Copilot Plus PCs will even get all of GPT-4o's voice and vision capabilities.\n\nMicrosoft said the first laptops under the Copilot Plus PC branding are already available for preorder today on its website from its partners including Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung. Of course, the company's own Surface laptops are also available for preorder. Microsoft revealed these Copilot Plus PCs will start at $999 with its upcoming Surface Laptop, undercutting the M3 MacBook Air's starting price of $1,099.\n\nFor a while, Apple was mostly competing with itself and its previous models thanks to how ahead of the competition its MacBooks were.

The event will focus on Artificial Intelligence and will highlight new AI technologies for consumers, businesses, and developers. Happening on Tuesday, just a week after Google I/O, Microsoft Build 2024 is set to be a busy event with many announcements about Microsoft products and services.\n\nMicrosoft Build 2024 will be held in person in Seattle and costs $2,125 to attend. However, you can also attend virtually for free, with live streaming available on the Microsoft Developer YouTube channel at 9 pm on May 21. Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, is expected to give the keynote speech, where he will announce new tools for developers and upcoming products.\n\nExpected Software and Hardware AI Announcements\n\nThis year, Microsoft is expected to make both software and hardware-related AI announcements at Build 2024. This could include new features for Windows 11 and possibly a sneak peek at Windows 12. A highlight for consumers will be the all-new Advanced RISC Machine (ARM)-based Windows PCs featuring the Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus, with OEMs such as Dell, Samsung, and Lenovo showcasing their first set of ARM-powered Windows PCs.\n\nLeaks suggest that new Surface devices, specifically the Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6, will be unveiled, with both x86-based and ARM-based models available.\n\nExpected announcements for Windows 11 at Build 2024 include features like AI Explorer and new AI experiences that will run natively on select PCs without cloud support. Microsoft could also demonstrate additional use cases for Copilot, the company's AI chatbot and personal assistant powered by GPT.\n\nDeveloper Tools and Azure Solutions\n\nFor developers, Microsoft is anticipated to introduce new products and solutions within the Azure cloud, including improved low-code and no-code capabilities. These enhancements will further empower developers to leverage AI in innovative ways.\n\nSEE ALSO: Love In The Age Of AI: Could Virtual Companionship Be The Answer To Loneliness?", "source": {"uri": "in.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Build", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Build"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "output"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ARM architecture family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reduced instruction set computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GUID Partition Table"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://sm.mashable.com/t/mashable_in/photo/default/1_gjm5.1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 623, "textEnd": 629}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Hoping to curb the confusion, Microsoft makes it a little bit easier with its new Copilot Plus PCs. Spotting any Windows laptop with this branding lets you know it features artificial intelligence-capable components under the hood without a second glance.\n\nBreaking down the technical, newer mobile chips feature an NPU (neural processing unit). Unlike the CPU (central processing unit) and GPU (graphical processing unit), NPUs are specifically designed to handle AI workloads, bringing them offline and away from the cloud.\n\nCopilot Plus PCs need more than just an NPU, though, as Microsoft demands a full spec. Much like its two new Surface entries, confirmed partners such as Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, and Lenovo all need at least a 256GB SSD and 16GB of RAM in compatible laptops. Despite Microsoft's recent push in Arm-based Windows devices, you won't be tied to any specific brand as both AMD and Intel will offer the same features. That said, Arm models will reportedly offer up to 15 hours of web browsing thanks to their efficiency.\n\nGiven Windows 11 will use up to 40 AI models and its Copilot assistant will soon be able to access OpenAI's Chat GPT-4o, the tech affords a whole host of new possibilities. We're still in the early stages, so it's tough to tell exactly how AI could help you. The fledgling version, however, will focus on Live Captions to transcribe meetings, translation to bridge the gap between languages, and a flagship feature dubbed 'Recall'.\n\nMuch like the name suggests, Recall leverages Microsoft's AI Explorer to remember everything you do, from the websites you visit to the meetings you have, photos you've viewed, and tasks you've performed. Performing a Recall will bring up a timeline of everything you've done, presenting you with a snapshot of that specific moment. It's not a million miles away from the Timeline in Windows 10, but far more advanced.\n\nAs a former privacy expert, I feel this comes with some concerns. Recall is a local feature and only you should have access to such thorough and sensitive data. However, your PC connects to the internet, which opens up vulnerabilities and potential exploits. Microsoft needs to be hot on the security patches to keep this in check, but it doesn't have the best track record with functional updates lately.

It just held its latest event and announced a new line of AI-powered PCs called Copilot PCs. These are computers with AI deeply integrated into the software which means that the experience will be very much AI-driven.\n\nWe have already seen a few examples of these new PCs in the form of the new Surface Pro, and the new Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge. The former is Microsoft's new and revamped Surface Pro 2-in-1 computer that uses either the new Snapdragon X Plus or Snapdragon X Elite chip depending on the model you get. The latter is Samsung's newest computer boasting the Snapdragon X Elite chip along with other top-tier specs. Both computers come with AI integration out of the box. These are just two of the amazing computers we can expect to come out using powerful AI.\n\nThe Copilot+ PCs aren't only being distributed by Microsoft this is similar to when Google announced the Chromebook+. This is a partnership between other manufacturers to implement more powerful software on their devices and create a more powerful platform. Microsoft partnered with Acer, Asus, Dell, Lenovo, and HP to bring forth these computers.\n\nThese new Copilot Computers will have a specialized version of Windows 11 that has AI massaged into every grain of the software. There will be deeply integrated AI tools powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o. That's the company's most powerful AI model to date.\n\nSince the software will come with AI built-in, you will be able to use a ton of on-device AI. The plus side to that is the fact that the data will be processed on the device, and it will not be sent to servers to be processed or used to train other models.\n\nAlong with that, these computers will come with a dedicated Copilot button on the keyboard. Obviously, this will be an extremely convenient shortcut to the AI.\n\nOne neat feature that Microsoft showed off was called Windows recall. This is a feature that will either sound very impressive or extremely scary. It's a feature that can read what is going on on your screen and actually remember what it saw. So, if you want to recall a document you were working on, a page you were searching for, or an action you were doing previously, you can ask Windows to recall what it was.\n\nSay, you were looking at a page about the best way to walk your dog, but you completely forgot about it. Well, Windows will remember that page and recall it for you. You simply have to ask it, \"What website was I looking at about how to walk your dog?\"\n\nIt sounds scary, but the important thing to remember is that everything is processed on your computer. So, none of the data that Windows remembered will be sent to the cloud.\n\nJust like Windows 11, there's definitely a bit of a barrier to cross for computers to be compatible with Copilot+. For starters, they need a minimum of 16GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD storage. That's not much to ask of a PC nowadays. The computer will also need to have an NPU with 40+ TOPS performance.", "source": {"uri": "androidheadlines.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Android Headlines"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arthur_brown@androidheadlines.com", "name": "Arthur Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-in-1_PC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2-in-1 PC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Galaxy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromebook", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chromebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solid-state drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer keyboard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Disk_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Disk Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.androidheadlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Copilot-Button-jpg.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Since then, there's been this tacit understanding that a second generation would be hitting the market, that would integrate AI features directly into Windows 11, and, well, with Microsoft Copilot+. That time is now.\n\nTo be clear, Microsoft Copilot has been around for a while, driving Microsoft's nascent push into AI technology, but Copilot+ brings a lot of the computation that was being done in the cloud directly to your laptop. That requires special hardware to handle, of course, but luckily, this announcement was paired with new hardware from basically every company that makes laptops - hardware that is specially designed to tackle the heavy-duty computing of AI workloads without being housed in a massive chassis that will literally weigh you down.\n\nThe Tensor cores in Nvidia's graphics cards have made hardware-accelerated AI possible on a consumer PC for a while. But with the new Snapdragon X Elite platform and the just-announced Intel Lunar Lake processors, you can get powerful AI capabilities in a device as thin and light as the new Surface Laptop.\n\nBecause Microsoft is trying to declare a whole new class of laptop with Copilot+, there's of course a ton of new laptops pouring out onto the market right now. And that's on top of the new Surface devices that'll get more of a spotlight at Microsoft Build on May 21.\n\nDell is putting all of its eggs in the AI basket, putting the Snapdragon X platform in its top-of-the-line XPS 13 Ultrabook. This is huge - the Dell XPS lineup has been powered by Intel since it first came out way back in 1993. Of course, this top-end laptop is being paired with a bunch of more budget-friendly laptops, too.\n\nEven Samsung is jumping in on the action with the Galaxy Book 4 Edge, which couples that Snapdragon X chip with an AMOLED display. That's going to be the Copilot+ laptop to go with if you primarily want to consume media, trust me.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more affordable, the Acer Swift 14, which has always been a value darling, is now sporting Copilot+ and the new Snapdragon X chip, starting at $1,099.\n\nAnyone looking to get their hands on one of these AI PCs can look forward to all of these launching starting in July.\n\nThis entire first wave of Copilot+ laptops is being powered by basically the same chipset, the Snapdragon X Elite. It's nothing to shake a stick at, but until Intel Lunar Lake processors start making their way into laptops in Q3 2024, you're going to need to stick with Qualcomm here.\n\nThere are three different processors here, each with 12 cores. The difference primarily lies in the turbo speed of the processors. At the high end, the Snapdragon X Elite X1E-84-100 is a 12-core processor with 42MB of cache, a multithread clock speed of 3.8GHz, and a max \"Dual core boost\" of 4.2 GHz. This latter clock speed will only happen when you put a lot of pressure on one or two threads. More heavily threaded applications like Adobe Premiere will cause all the cores to equalize at 3.8GHz instead.\n\nBut even at the low-end, the X1E-78-100 has a max multi-thread frequency of 3.4GHz, and doesn't even have a special dual-core boost. But you're still getting the same 12 cores and 42MB of cache, so you'll only feel a major difference in lightly threaded applications like PC games - which these laptops aren't really designed for anyways.\n\nFor most people, though, the middle-ground X1E-80-100 is probably going to be the sweet spot. You lose just 200Mhz in both multithreaded and dual-threaded boost speeds which is, essentially, nothing. It's definitely not worth spending hundreds more on, no matter what spiffy marketing tells you to do.\n\nWhile Microsoft wants everyone to think that anything that runs Xbox Cloud Streaming is a gaming laptop, these Copilot+ laptops definitely aren't. Instead, these are primarily aimed at creative professionals that can use the AI feature set to boost their productivity.\n\nFeatures like Recall are leading the charge, which is essentially an AI-boosted Windows Explorer search, and will help you find something that's on your PC, even if you don't know which folder or even drive you saved it on. It can also help you find webpages that you looked at once and have since forgot where you found them, and does so through an AI model that watches what you do on your PC, which is how it helps you find things you've already looked at.\n\nFor anyone that thinks this is a little freaky, it is, but Microsoft assures us that the information is only stored locally on your PC, and will never touch the cloud.\n\nOf course it wouldn't be generative AI in 2024 if it wasn't for image generation, and of course the image generator you can find on Bing has been ported to run locally on Copilot+ PCs. This is essentially the main goal of these devices, after all: take AI computation from relying entirely on cloud computing and let local hardware do more of the heavy lifting.\n\nMicrosoft isn't the only company working these features into its software. Adobe has been leaning heavily into AI features in Photoshop and Premiere, and these Copilot+ PCs are of course supporting the entire Adobe Creative Cloud suite from day one. Other creative apps like DaVinci Resolve, and djay Pro are also using this AI horsepower.\n\nAs for gaming, though, we're going to have to keep waiting. Nvidia showed us a sneak peek at what AI-powered gaming would look like at CES 2024, but this isn't it. Sure, you'll be able to stream Xbox games on these new Copilot+ laptops, and maybe even run Minecraft. But this isn't going to change the gaming PC scene much at all, especially considering that generative AI has been running on desktop graphics cards since the beginning, with the RTX 2080. We'll have to keep waiting to see how this is going to impact video games, but for now if all you care about is gaming, Copilot+ shouldn't really be on your radar.", "source": {"uri": "ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thread (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer Electronics Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_acceleration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hardware acceleration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cache (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clock rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surface Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swift (programming language)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_XPS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dell XPS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrabook", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultrabook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edge (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chipset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Commodore", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Commodore", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet_PCs", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet PCs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/20/copilot-pc-hero-1536x865-1716237053537.jpg?width=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 1461, "textEnd": 1467}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Nadella and Microsoft are gearing up to make another significant change.\n\nSpeaking at a the Microsoft Surface AI event, Nadella introduced the new Copilot Plus PCs. Nadella recalled how 30 years ago Microsoft introduced Win32 and changed the PC game. Now, with Copilot PCs, Microsoft is ready to do that again. \"We're entering this new era where computers not only understand us but can actually anticipate what we want and our intent is,\" said Nadella at a media briefing session at Microsoft's campus in Redmond, Seattle.\n\nNadella also spoke about how this new category of devices \"can see us, hear us\" and deliver experiences that would make every organisation, every user better.\n\nMicrosoft unveiled a slew of new AI features coming to Windows and Nadella was optimistic about how it will create more opportunities. \"The web was born on Windows, we are again creating a new opportunity across our entire ecosystem as we build this new category together,\" said Nadella.\n\nCopilot+ PCs, according to Microsoft, leverage powerful processors and multiple state-of-the-art AI models, including several of Microsoft's world-class small language models to enhance the user experience. \"Copilot+ PCs are the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever built. With powerful new silicon capable of an incredible 40+ TOPS (trillion operations per second), all-day battery life and much more,\" Nadella said about the new category Microsoft is creating.\n\nHe also stressed that how the core architecture -- \"systems, silicon and AI\" -- will ensure that everything is run locally on the device. \"We are bringing in an al-new SoC and a completely modernised OS for these incredible experiences,\" said Nadella.\n\nThe Microsoft CEO stressed on Microsoft's \"partner-first\" approach as it is working with Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm to integrate processors in the new Copilot+ PCs. Microsoft is also partnering with Asus, Samsung, Dell, Lenovo, Acer, HP for an all-new range of Copilot+ PCs.\n\nNadella pointed out that the AI wave is coming to PCs and Microsoft wants to do it responsibly and keep user privacy and security at the heart of it.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_API", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windows API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Surface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PC game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silicon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2024/05/20240520201220_Satya-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

The machines from Microsoft's Surface line and manufacturing partners will offer more power and will be 58% faster than Apple's top-of-the-line MacBook Air M3, the company said, thanks in part to a special chip that's dedicated to AI processing. The new machines will start at $1,000.\n\nMicrosoft also said OpenAI's GPT-4o, an updated version of its GPT-4 that's better at handling text, audio and images in real time, will soon come to the company's Copilot AI assistant. Microsoft demonstrated a feature called Recall that's designed to help users find a buried browser tab, file, email or chat, based on conversational language prompts. It will be like \"photographic memory,\" said Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft's consumer chief marketing officer.\n\nMicrosoft is aiming to demonstrate that generative AI will revolutionize computing for regular consumers, not simply its corporate cloud customers. Though the company embedded AI in its Bing search engine early on, Nadella has expressed frustration that Microsoft hasn't launched compelling consumer products more quickly, Bloomberg previously reported. To help rectify the situation, in March he hired DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman to oversee consumer AI efforts.\n\n\"The pursuit has always been about how to build computers that understand us, instead of us having to understand computers and I feel like we really are close to that real breakthrough,\" Nadella said.\n\nA live captions feature in Windows can translate any video content into English from 40 languages in real time. Because it's part of the operating system, the feature works on any conferencing or entertainment apps. The company is also adding a new AI co-creator program that uses machine learning models to turn basic sketches into more complex images.\n\nThe Recall feature relies on several language models embedded into Windows and lets users set certain content as private so it cannot be archived by the AI software. More broadly, the features use a new layer of software called the Windows Copilot Runtime, made up of more than 40 AI models that can handle a variety of text, visual, audio and analysis tasks.\n\nMicrosoft announced support for a new PC initiative from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, but the computers debuting on Monday all run chips from Qualcomm, the software maker said. Their inclusion provides a lift to Qualcomm, which is betting its mobile phone technology is better suited to the next generation of AI-infused machines that consume more power.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_day@seattletimes.com", "name": "Matt Day", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "dina_bass@seattletimes.com", "name": "Dina Bass", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Redmond_campus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Redmond campus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Surface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GPT-4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DeepMind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 92}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

This week's Microsoft event will have the answers.\n\nSpringtime means it's keynote season in the tech world, and in 2024, that means \"time to show off your AI bona fides.\" Google and OpenAI have already revealed big new upgrades to Gemini and ChatGPT this month, and now it's time for Microsoft Build. The tech giant's annual developer conference kicks off with a keynote slated for Tuesday, May 21 at 12 PM ET/9 AM PT, and you can watch the entire event live on YouTube (which is also embedded below) and at Microsoft's site (registration required). What about that Microsoft Surface event you may have heard about? Well, that's actually happening a day earlier: Monday, May 20. Confused? Don't worry, here's the tl;dr version of what to expect, summarized from our more in-depth What to expect from Microsoft Build 2024: The Surface event, Windows 11 and AI.\n\nOne day before the official Build keynote, Microsoft is hosting a more intimate event for journalists at which it plans to reveal its \"AI vision across hardware and software.\" That event won't be livestreamed, but Engadget will have full coverage as it unfolds.\n\nThe rumor mill strongly suggests that we'll see new consumer-targeted Surface PCs. And unlike the enterprise-centric models like the Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 introduced back in March, these new models may be powered by updated Qualcomm Snapdragon chips - Arm chips that run cooler and offer far better battery life than their Intel and AMD equivalents, but often at the expense of reduced app compatibility and processing speeds.\n\nThe thought is that Microsoft is following the template that its fellow tech giants have demonstrated this season: get the hardware announcements out of the way first, clearing the runway for an all-AI showcase at the developer conference. That's what happened with Apple and Google in recent weeks, as they respectively revealed new iPads weeks before the WWDC event in June, and a new Pixel 8a phone in the days leading up to Google I/O.\n\nWhat's that mean for Tuesday? Last year's Build announcements give you the general flavor: Microsoft's Copilot AI (possibly with more impressive OpenAI-powered smarts) integrated into even more of Microsoft's DNA, likely both at the device level (Windows) all the way up to the company's massive cloud infrastructure.\n\nWhile much of Tuesday's news will be through the prism of Microsoft's developer community, we're looking forward to giving you the big picture on what it all means for end users - and how it dovetails with the hardware announcements we expect to hit on Monday.

Microsoft has just held a major launch event at its Redmond campus in Seattle and it's boasting that its new range of portable PCs will be 58% faster than Apple's MacBook M3.\n\nThat's a big claim but it will certainly be welcomed by millions of Windows users who may have felt they were being left behind.\n\nThe boost is down to some new technology tucked under the shell of these latest laptops which includes a new ARM processor made by Qualcomm. With the Snapdragon X Elite chip inside, users will see 40 trillion operations per second being made - that should make daily digital tasks feel silky smooth and stutter-free.\n\nDespite all that power, things are super efficient. Treat the machines kindly and you could see 22 hours of life before they need to go near a plug.\n\n\"Copilot+ PCs are the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever built,\" Microsoft proudly exclaimed.\n\nAlthough power is clearly important, the next breed of Windows 11 devices will also be way smarter. Full integration with Microsoft's smart AI Copilot will speed up tasks, make searching the web more fluid and improve the way you find things on the PC. There's even a dedicated button included on the keyboard which launches Copilot with just one touch.\n\nSomething else that's new is Recall. This pretty much does exactly what it says on the tin. Think of it a bit like a more interactive way of searching your PC. With Recall launched you can scroll through a timeline of things you've done on your PC or search for specific things. Say you were looking at holidays earlier in the month and can't remember the hotel you spotted, give Recall some basic data and it will try and track it down.\n\n\"We set out to solve one of the most frustrating problems we encounter daily - finding something we know we have seen before on our PC,\" Microsoft explained. \"Today, we must remember what file folder it was stored in, what website it was on, or scroll through hundreds of emails trying to find it. Now with Recall, you can access virtually what you have seen or done on your PC in a way that feels like having photographic memory.\"\n\nSo what PCs are getting these upgrades? Devices from the likes of Samsung, Dell and Lenovo are all coming soon along with big updates to Microsoft's Surface range.\n\nThe powerful new Surface Laptop gets thin bezels, a touchscreen display, premium audio, and now features a haptic touchpad.\n\nIt will be available in 13.8\" and 15\" sizes along with four colours. Microsoft reckons it will last for 22 hours and get those all-new AI experiences.\n\nThen there's the Surface Pro with this 2-in-1 laptop getting a speed boost which makes it over 80 percent faster than before. There's also an optional OLED screen and ultrawide field of view camera. Finally, there's a better Flex Keyboard which has been designed to be used both attached or detached.

Since then, there's been this tacit understanding that a second generation would be hitting the market, that would integrate AI features directly into Windows 11, and, well, with Microsoft Copilot+. That time is now.\n\nTo be clear, Microsoft Copilot has been around for a while, driving Microsoft's nascent push into AI technology, but Copilot+ brings a lot of the computation that was being done in the cloud directly to your laptop. That requires special hardware to handle, of course, but luckily, this announcement was paired with new hardware from basically every company that makes laptops - hardware that is specially designed to tackle the heavy-duty computing of AI workloads without being housed in a massive chassis that will literally weigh you down.\n\nThe Tensor cores in Nvidia's graphics cards have made hardware-accelerated AI possible on a consumer PC for a while. But with the new Snapdragon X Elite platform and the just-announced Intel Lunar Lake processors, you can get powerful AI capabilities in a device as thin and light as the new Surface Laptop.\n\nA Deluge of Laptops\n\nBecause Microsoft is trying to declare a whole new class of laptop with Copilot+, there's of course a ton of new laptops pouring out onto the market right now. And that's on top of the new Surface devices that'll get more of a spotlight at Microsoft Build on May 21.\n\nDell is putting all of its eggs in the AI basket, putting the Snapdragon X platform in its top-of-the-line XPS 13 Ultrabook. This is huge - the Dell XPS lineup has been powered by Intel since it first came out way back in 1993. Of course, this top-end laptop is being paired with a bunch of more budget-friendly laptops, too.\n\nEven Samsung is jumping in on the action with the Galaxy Book 4 Edge, which couples that Snapdragon X chip with an AMOLED display. That's going to be the Copilot+ laptop to go with if you primarily want to consume media, trust me.\n\nIf you're looking for something a bit more affordable, the Acer Swift 14, which has always been a value darling, is now sporting Copilot+ and the new Snapdragon X chip, starting at $1,099.\n\nAnyone looking to get their hands on one of these AI PCs can look forward to all of these launching starting in July.\n\nUnder the Hood\n\nThis entire first wave of Copilot+ laptops is being powered by basically the same chipset, the Snapdragon X Elite. It's nothing to shake a stick at, but until Intel Lunar Lake processors start making their way into laptops in Q3 2024, you're going to need to stick with Qualcomm here.\n\nThere are three different processors here, each with 12 cores. The difference primarily lies in the turbo speed of the processors. At the high end, the Snapdragon X Elite X1E-84-100 is a 12-core processor with 42MB of cache, a multithread clock speed of 3.8GHz, and a max \"Dual core boost\" of 4.2 GHz. This latter clock speed will only happen when you put a lot of pressure on one or two threads. More heavily threaded applications like Adobe Premiere will cause all the cores to equalize at 3.8GHz instead.\n\nBut even at the low-end, the X1E-78-100 has a max multi-thread frequency of 3.4GHz, and doesn't even have a special dual-core boost. But you're still getting the same 12 cores and 42MB of cache, so you'll only feel a major difference in lightly threaded applications like PC games - which these laptops aren't really designed for anyways.\n\nFor most people, though, the middle-ground X1E-80-100 is probably going to be the sweet spot. You lose just 200Mhz in both multithreaded and dual-threaded boost speeds which is, essentially, nothing. It's definitely not worth spending hundreds more on, no matter what spiffy marketing tells you to do.\n\nOK, But Who is This For?\n\nWhile Microsoft wants everyone to think that anything that runs Xbox Cloud Streaming is a gaming laptop, these Copilot+ laptops definitely aren't. Instead, these are primarily aimed at creative professionals that can use the AI feature set to boost their productivity.\n\nFeatures like Recall are leading the charge, which is essentially an AI-boosted Windows Explorer search, and will help you find something that's on your PC, even if you don't know which folder or even drive you saved it on. It can also help you find webpages that you looked at once and have since forgot where you found them, and does so through an AI model that watches what you do on your PC, which is how it helps you find things you've already looked at.\n\nFor anyone that thinks this is a little freaky, it is, but Microsoft assures us that the information is only stored locally on your PC, and will never touch the cloud.\n\nOf course it wouldn't be generative AI in 2024 if it wasn't for image generation, and of course the image generator you can find on Bing has been ported to run locally on Copilot+ PCs. This is essentially the main goal of these devices, after all: take AI computation from relying entirely on cloud computing and let local hardware do more of the heavy lifting.\n\nMicrosoft isn't the only company working these features into its software. Adobe has been leaning heavily into AI features in Photoshop and Premiere, and these Copilot+ PCs are of course supporting the entire Adobe Creative Cloud suite from day one. Other creative apps like DaVinci Resolve, and djay Pro are also using this AI horsepower.\n\nAs for gaming, though, we're going to have to keep waiting. Nvidia showed us a sneak peek at what AI-powered gaming would look like at CES 2024, but this isn't it. Sure, you'll be able to stream Xbox games on these new Copilot+ laptops, and maybe even run Minecraft. But this isn't going to change the gaming PC scene much at all, especially considering that generative AI has been running on desktop graphics cards since the beginning, with the RTX 2080. We'll have to keep waiting to see how this is going to impact video games, but for now if all you care about is gaming, Copilot+ shouldn't really be on your radar.\n\nJackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN and the PC components queen.

However, a recap video should be available after the fact a little later. Microsoft will debut new Arm PCs and Surfaces that should beat Intel-based Ultrabooks on both power and battery life, albeit at the cost of some app compatibility in some cases (looking at you, Adobe). In addition, Microsoft has been demonstrating new AI features for Microsoft Copilot, which is the firm's answer to Google's Gemini AI search and ChatGPT's assistive apps. But who cares about all that, what about gaming? Well, there's an update on that front too.\n\nDuring the event, Microsoft showcased one of these new integrations. Microsoft Copilot will be embedded directly in video games, starting with Minecraft. Players will be able to use natural language to ask questions like \"How do I craft a sword?\" and the Copilot will search your chests and inventories for the necessary materials, or guide you to them if you don't have them. It will also explain how to craft the item, and so on, eliminating the need to alt tab and read a website for Minecraft guides like ours (RIP Windows Central).\n\nMicrosoft has made a rather large emphasis on privacy at this event as well, claiming that data used via these new AI PCs will remain on-device, and won't be uploaded to the cloud or used to train language models without consent. We'll believe that one when we see it, but Microsoft has been criticized heavily across the board for its lackadaisical approach to privacy in Windows 10 and beyond, so it will be interesting to see how this news is received by gamers.\n\nWith Google and Microsoft both pushing hard on taking data from publishers and injecting it directly into experiences, a question mark has been growing over the future of the web in general. If it's no longer commercially viable to publish content, getting information into AI models will increasingly defer to social media platforms instead, making acquiring accurate information potentially increasingly difficult.\n\nEither way, the convenience of simply being able to ask your video games how to kill a boss or how to find the secrets in a specific area and so on will fundamentally change how games are made, similarly to how internet discussions and websites have in the past. World of Warcraft's developer team have struggled to balance the game's addon APIs, since many of them allow players to create addons and mods that allow well-researched players to automate certain game mechanics, for example. Will we get to a point where we can ask AI to simply play parts of games you don't like for you?\n\nDatabase websites and Wikis may find it increasingly difficult to fund their operations in this new world, which may conversely negatively impact the quality of information derived from these platforms in the first place, creating a downward spiral and perpetuating what some AI theorists have described as \"model collapse,\" when AIs are no longer being fed accurate information.\n\nThe implications of AI tools are absolutely huge, and nobody truly knows how much things will change. But I think we all know, fundamentally, that things will change immensely in the coming years. Many of the best upcoming Xbox games and best upcoming PC games will doubtless change too.", "source": {"uri": "windowscentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Windows Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jez_corden@windowscentral.com", "name": "Jez Corden", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Windows 10"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_plc", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Future plc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game modding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boss (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Game mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PC game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World of Warcraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wiki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Puzzle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Puzzle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Software", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Educational", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QK8cAuTq6XEmrbeQyQJjvB-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

The new machines will start at US$1,000.\n\nMicrosoft also said OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, an updated version of its GPT-4 that is better at handling text, audio and images in real-time, will soon come to the company\u2019s Copilot AI assistant.\n\nMicrosoft demonstrated a feature called Recall that is designed to help users find a buried browser tab, file, email or chat, based on conversational language prompts. It will be like \u201cphotographic memory,\u201d said Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft\u2019s consumer chief marketing officer.\n\nMicrosoft is aiming to demonstrate that generative AI will revolutionise computing for regular consumers, not simply its corporate cloud customers.\n\nThough the company embedded AI in its Bing search engine early on, Nadella has expressed frustration that Microsoft has not launched compelling consumer products more quickly, Bloomberg previously reported. To help rectify the situation, in March he hired DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman to oversee consumer AI efforts.\n\n\u201cThe pursuit has always been about how to build computers that understand us, instead of us having to understand computers and I feel like we really are close to that real breakthrough,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nA live captions feature in Windows can translate any video content into English from 40 languages in real time. Because it is part of the operating system, the feature works on any conferencing or entertainment apps.\n\nThe company is also adding a new AI co-creator program that uses machine learning models to turn basic sketches into more complex images.\n\nThe Recall feature relies on several language models embedded into Windows and lets users set certain content as private so it cannot be archived by the AI software. More broadly, the features use a new layer of software called the Windows Copilot Runtime, made up of more than 40 AI models that can handle a variety of text, visual, audio and analysis tasks.\n\nMicrosoft announced support for a new PC initiative from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, but the computers debuting on Monday all run chips from Qualcomm, the software maker said.\n\nTheir inclusion provides a lift to Qualcomm, which is betting its mobile phone technology is better suited to the next generation of AI-infused machines that consume more power.", "source": {"uri":

At the company's recent Surface and AI event, it showed off its new Copilot AI, which is Microsoft's unique twist on what we've seen from big tech firms like OpenAI (ChatGPT) and Google (Gemini).\n\nOver on X/Twitter, Microsoft posted a demo video of a player using Copilot to learn how to craft a sword in Minecraft. According to Windows Central, this AI will respond to natural language (like most LLMs) and will explain how to use the resources you have, and will even guide you to them. Microsoft emphasized that the data used for Copilot will remain on-device, and that it won't be uploaded to the cloud or used to train language models further without the user's consent.\n\nAs with all AI models, it sounds good in theory, but it remains to be seen if it actually works. So-called AI \"hallucinations\" (i.e. the model making up or reporting inaccurate info) have been a problem with LLMs from the very beginning, which could lead to some frustrating scenarios. But all-in-all, this is a potential game-changer for those who would prefer to avoid digging through game wikis and Google searches to find the answer to that tough puzzle.\n\nAt this event, Microsoft showed off what it calls \"Copilot+ PCs,\" which come loaded with proprietary AI technology.

Now, PC users will get to hear more about how AI will be embedded in Windows and what they can do with it on new AI PCs.\n\nBuild comes days after Google I/O, where the search giant unveiled its most powerful AI model yet and showed how its Gemini AI will work on computers and phones. Prior to Google's event, OpenAI announced its new GPT-4o model. Microsoft is OpenAI's lead investor, and its Copilot technology is based on OpenAI's models..\n\nFor Microsoft, the challenge is twofold: keeping a prominent position in AI and bolstering PC sales, which have been in the doldrums for the past two years following an upgrade cycle during the pandemic.\n\nIn a recent note on Dell to investors, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote that he remains \"bullish on the PC market recovery\" due to commentary from customers and recent \"upward revisions to notebook\" original design manufacturer (ODM) builds.\n\nTechnology industry researcher Gartner estimated that PC shipments increased 0.9% in the quarter after a multi-year slump.

Here's what to expect.", "body": "Wedbush analysts projected that Microsoft's AI tools could generate $25-$30 billion in revenue by 2025.\n\nMicrosoft is in the spotlight as it follows major announcements from OpenAI and Google last week and prepares to unveil its latest AI innovations at Build, the company's annual developer conference.\n\nThe tech giant is also holding an exclusive event for journalists on Monday detailing its vision for hardware, which will likely feature its new Surface lineup along with some software updates.\n\nThe next day is the main event, Microsoft's Build keynote, where it's expected to announce updates to its AI assistant Copilot and cloud computing platform Azure, along with other Windows features.\n\nWedbush analysts said in a Monday note that they believe Microsoft's AI and cloud advancements have been underestimated by the stock market -- but Microsoft tools like Copilot will be a major source of revenue growth that could generate between $25 and $30 billion for Microsoft by its fiscal year 2025.\n\nAccording to Dan Ives, Wedbush's managing director and senior equity analyst, Microsoft's big week is expected to be all about three things -- here's what's expected to be front and center.\n\nWedbush analysts expect Microsoft to roll out more Copilot and AI features into its consumer and enterprise product stack.\n\nWedbush said in its analyst note that it expects more AI integration with Microsoft apps like Excel, Teams, and Word, which will increase subscriptions and strengthen Microsoft's consumer base.\n\nOver 70% of Microsoft's installed base \"will ultimately be on this AI-driven functionality\" in the next three years, the analyst said, which will be a big change for the company.\n\nIves said putting AI features into Windows will give developers the foundation to build AI use cases through Windows and, ultimately, Azure.\n\nIves said in some ways, the most important aspect of the developer conference is going to be showing off the AI framework in Azure.\n\nIn its analyst note, Wedbush estimated that Microsoft's customers still have plenty of room to increase their spending with the company. For every $100 they spend on Azure, there is an estimated $35-$40 in potential additional AI spending, they wrote.\n\n\"Cloud is where the battleground is between Google, Oracle, Amazon,\" Ives said. \"Microsoft is showing developers to look no further than between us and OpenAI.\"\n\nWedbush analysts anticipate new laptops along with Windows updates this week.\n\nThe new hardware expected to be announced on Monday, the day before Build kicks off, could include the Surface Pro 10 and the Surface Laptop 6, The Verge reports. Both would run on Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite processors as the company transitions to Arm, The Verge said.\n\nNew processors would come as Microsoft and other PC companies have been under pressure to ramp up their processing chips since Apple transitioned to creating its own. Recent reports also indicate that Apple is working on revamping its entire Mac lineup with a series of new M4 processors that aim to put AI at their center.\n\nBut Microsoft's Surface updates may kick off the trend. Ives said the new AI Surface updates will start a new PC-driven cycle that's \"AI-led, from Dell to Microsoft, and ultimately to Apple as well.\"\n\nMicrosoft has big shoes to fill following OpenAI's spring update and Google's I/O conference last week. Both companies announced human-like updates to their AI products, showcasing their AI agent's ability to respond to prompts with voice and act as a tutor.\n\nGoogle also announced a revamped search engine integrated with AI, which competes with Microsft's AI-powered Bing.\n\nBut according to Ives, Microsoft will be a \"showstopper.\" Due to OpenAI's collaboration with Microsoft, Ives said the conference will build on OpenAI's announcements from last week.\n\nBusiness Insider will be liveblogging Microsoft's big opening keynote on Tuesday at 12 p.m. ET, so check back with us then to follow along.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Surface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Excel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "output"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Update", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windows Update"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/yweZkDz1j.xm80_erpp28g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/business_insider_articles_888/53adbdf8460de56b625111d100d32501", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

The speed and efficiency of these systems are unmasked with all-day battery life,\" Michael Dell, Chairman and chief executive officer of Dell Technologies, told the audience at an event in Las Vegas.\n\nDell is betting big on Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus processors, which will come to a range of laptops \"later this year.\" The company is launching the XPS 13 with the more powerful X Elite processor, while the Inspiron 14 and 14 Plus will ship with the X Plus, Qualcomm's entry-level laptop chip. Both new chips are based on the Oryon CPU, Adreno GPU, and Hexagon NPU architectures, with the X Plus sporting a 10-core CPU complex versus 12 cores in the higher-end chip.\n\nThe San Diego-based mobile chipset giant Qualcomm touts its new PC chips as true \"AI\" processors and promises a 45 TOPS NPU, which puts Qualcomm ahead of any current platform from AMD or Intel. The next-generation chips are all about the NPU, or neural processing unit, which is made specifically for machine learning and generative artificial intelligence tasks. It is fundamentally different from a CPU and GPU.\n\nThe Copilot Plus AI PCs come packed with AI features including \"Recall\", which Microsoft describes as a photographic memory of your PC. The Recall AI feature , which relies on AI models and run offline on the device, let users able to search through a log of previous actions on PCs. Other features include Live Captions, CoCreator, background removal for both photo and video and more.\n\nARM-based laptops using the Windows operating system have struggled over the years, but the next wave of Snapdragon-powered Windows laptops could not only offer the desired CPU performance, long battery life, developer support and app performance but also excel in AI-accelerated tasks.\n\nExperts, however, say the Windows on Arm platform is still in its early days, and a lot depends on how the ecosystem and app compatibility evolve over the next couple of months.\n\nNvidia has emerged as the early winner in AI chips through its server versions that power data centers running large language models. But other chipmakers such as Intel, Apple, and Qualcomm are finding ways to bring AI from cloud services to local computing. The concept of AI PCs -- personal computers powered by AI chips that can run AI models locally without relying on the cloud -- may help both chipmakers and PC vendors differentiate AI-infused computers from regular PCs. AI-powered personal computers will offer better data privacy, longer battery life, and more AI applications, Dell says.\n\n\"The Windows ecosystem has been eager to offer systems to compete with Apple Silicon, particularly around battery life, and Snapdragon X Elite has the potential to unlock that ability for Windows OEMs like Dell,\" said Bryan Ma, VP of Devices Research at International Data Corporation. However, he added that running local AI models on PCs is still relatively new, so the use cases are a work in progress.\n\nMa said that while Qualcomm is eyeing the PC market with new Arm-powered Windows laptops, Intel still powered 72 per cent of the notebook market globally last year compared to Qualcomm at less than 1 percent share. \"Qualcomm can gain with its new platform, especially with big efforts from Microsoft rallying by its side now. But inertia will still favour Intel for many years given how accustomed the industry is to work with Intel in everything from product design to marketing,\" he added.\n\nDell is among the first wave of PC vendors launching \"Copilot Plus AI PCs\" on the market. Microsoft, too, is bringing a new wave of Surface Pro computers with Qualcomm chips and built-in Gen AI capabilities.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anuj_bhatia@indianexpress.com", "name": "Anuj Bhatia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Hexagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Hexagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_XPS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dell XPS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adreno", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adreno"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chipset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Technologies", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dell Technologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ARM architecture family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Data_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Data Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Systems", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/Dell-AI-PCs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

The machines from Microsoft's Surface line and manufacturing partners will offer more power and will be 58% faster than Apple's top-of-the-line MacBook Air M3, the company said, thanks in part to a special chip that's dedicated to AI processing. The new machines will start at $1,000.\n\nMicrosoft also said OpenAI's GPT-4o, an updated version of its GPT-4 that's better at handling text, audio and images in real-time, will soon come to the company's Copilot AI assistant. Microsoft demonstrated a feature called Recall that's designed to help users find a buried browser tab, file, email or chat, based on conversational language prompts. It will be like \"photographic memory,\" said Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft's consumer chief marketing officer.\n\nMicrosoft is aiming to demonstrate that generative AI will revolutionize computing for regular consumers, not simply its corporate cloud customers. Though the company embedded AI in its Bing search engine early on, Nadella has expressed frustration that Microsoft hasn't launched compelling consumer products more quickly, Bloomberg previously reported. To help rectify the situation, in March he hired DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman to oversee consumer AI efforts.\n\n\"The pursuit has always been about how to build computers that understand us, instead of us having to understand computers and I feel like we really are close to that real breakthrough,\" Nadella said.\n\nA live captions feature in Windows can translate any video content into English from 40 languages in real time. Because it's part of the operating system, the feature works on any conferencing or entertainment apps. The company is also adding a new AI co-creator program that uses machine learning models to turn basic sketches into more complex images.\n\nThe Recall feature relies on several language models embedded into Windows and lets users set certain content as private so it cannot be archived by the AI software. More broadly, the features use a new layer of software called the Windows Copilot Runtime, made up of more than 40 AI models that can handle a variety of text, visual, audio and analysis tasks.\n\nMicrosoft announced support for a new PC initiative from Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., but the computers debuting on Monday all run chips from Qualcomm Inc., the software maker said. Their inclusion provides a lift to Qualcomm, which is betting its mobile phone technology is better suited to the next generation of AI-infused machines that consume more power.", "source": {"uri": "dailymaverick.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Maverick"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GPT-4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Surface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DeepMind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/395046430.jpg?w=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

It's become a brainstorming staple for many people and a means to generate AI imagery or written outlines with text prompts.\n\nBut now, Microsoft has unveiled Copilot+, which boasts next-gen AI features and AI tools. But just what is the difference between Copilot+ and the original Copilot? There's a lot to take in here, so let's figure it out.\n\nCopilot is largely an AI assistant that does your bidding on distant servers. The base option is free, but those who pay for a Copilot Pro subscription gain priority access to GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo. This subscription also allows you to generate 100 images with Designer and integrates Copilot within Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook.\n\nAs for Copilot+, this is more of a range of AI capabilities that are only possible on an AI PC. To be clear, Copilot+ is not its own service in the same way that Copilot is, but rather various AI capabilities that are tied into other programs.\n\nYou can read more in my Microsoft Copilot+ FAQ, but I'll give a few examples to drive the idea home. For starters, Copilot+ integrates with creative programs like Adobe Photoshop in order to make fast AI edits, such as removing the background of an image and filling in that space believably with new imagery. Recall is another helpful AI feature of Copilot+ that makes it possible to view a timeline of things you previously viewed on the laptop. That way, you can find the exact webpage, document, or application you previously looked at.\n\nRather than relying on generative AI services like Midjourney or even Copilot (via Dall-E) itself, those with Copilot+ can generate AI images locally right on your computer in Cocreate. This adds a layer of security and privacy to AI generations since they aren't online. Copilot+ can also help you look and sound your best via Windows Studio Effects by doing things like effectively blurring the background behind you, giving the impression that you are maintaining eye contact, adding filters to your feed, and more.\n\nIn the workplace or for personal use, Copilot+ can also provide annotations or suggestions for how to improve your work while you're typing up documents. If you need to communicate with someone who speaks another language, Copilot+ can help provide live translations through a program called Live Captions.\n\nMore services are bound to be made compatible with Copilot+ as time goes on.\n\nYou can view the original Copilot AI assistant as a distant AI service and Copilot+ as a local AI service. But both are useful depending on your situation. You might often find yourself wanting to rely on both at the same time.\n\nThe original Copilot AI assistant allows you to type in text prompts and receive AI-generated text or imagery that was created on a distant server. If you pay for Copilot Pro, you can get additional AI perks, such as priority access to GPT-4 and Copilot integration within various Windows programs. Since its release, Copilot has proved to be very useful, and many people will be more than happy to stick with this cloud-based AI service.\n\nMeanwhile, the people who will benefit most from Copilot+ are those who are interested in running AI tasks locally on their AI PC laptops. This largely includes business professionals and creatives who want to keep their work private and more secure rather than spreading it onto the cloud. Additionally, Copilot+ allows you to get more AI suggestions on your laptop workflows to make your work better. Not to mention, Copilot+ makes it easier and faster to make AI edits in creative programs like those offered in Adobe Creative Cloud.", "source": {"uri": "windowscentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Windows Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_spear@windowscentral.com", "name": "Rebecca Spear", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "GPT-4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Outlook", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Outlook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Excel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft PowerPoint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midjourney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midjourney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Creative_Cloud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Creative Cloud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Computer", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Computer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NKkUsYrEaExGBysry7erKa-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

That is up to 20% more battery in local video playback than the MacBook Air 15'' M3, said the company.\n\nIn the future, Microsoft will partner with Intel and AMD, starting with Lunar Lake and Strix for Copilot+ PCs. Intel has already announced Lunar Lake processors will arrive in Q3 2024. AMD's Zen 5-based Strix will arrive later this year, but the exact time frame is not available yet. We should get more details at AMD's Computex 2024 event on June 3rd.\n\nMicrosoft expects to see these devices paired with powerful graphics cards like NVIDIA GeForce RTX and AMD Radeon, targeted at advanced gamers and creators in the future.\n\nMicrosoft 365 apps like Teams, PowerPoint, Outlook, Word, Excel, OneDrive and OneNote. Chrome, Spotify, Zoom, WhatsApp, Blender, Affinity Suite, DaVinci Resolve and many more now run natively on Arm with additional apps, like Slack, releasing later this year. Adobe apps Illustrator, Premiere Pro and more are coming this summer.\n\n87% of the total app minutes people spend in apps today have native Arm versions. With a powerful new emulator, Prism, these apps run great, whether native or emulated, said Microsoft\n\nWith the new Recall feature in Copilot+ PCs, you can find what you've seen on your PC using the clues you remember. You can use natural language to search, or scroll back through time, and get back to what you need to find through text and visual matches. All stored locally, with privacy and controls built-in, said the company.\n\nUsing Cocreator in Paint, you can use your ink strokes and words to describe the image you want to create, making it easier to create, refine and evolve your ideas in near real time.\n\nWith Restyle Image, you can reimagine your personal photos with a new style combining image generation and photo editing in Photos. You can use a pre-set style like Cyberpunk or Claymation to change the background, foreground or full picture to create an entirely new image. You can also get visual inspiration with Image Creator in Photos.\n\nSuper Resolution that will let you restore old photos and AI narrator to tell a story based on your photos will be available for Photos soon. These features powered by Neural Processing Units (NPUs) are built into the Windows, and are free.\n\nIn addition to the new Microsoft Surface Pro and Surface Laptop, the company has partnered with several OEMs such as Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung for Copilot+ PCs starting at USD 999 with pre-orders beginning today and availability starting on June 18th.", "source": {"uri":

Here's what to expect.", "body": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nThe next day is the main event, Microsoft's Build keynote, where it's expected to announce updates to its AI assistant Copilot and cloud computing platform Azure, along with other Windows features.\n\nWedbush analysts said in a Monday note that they believe Microsoft's AI and cloud advancements have been underestimated by the stock market -- but Microsoft tools like Copilot will be a major source of revenue growth that could generate between $25 and $30 billion for Microsoft by its fiscal year 2025.\n\nAccording to Dan Ives, Wedbush's managing director and senior equity analyst, Microsoft's big week is expected to be all about three things -- here's what's expected to be front and center.\n\nWedbush analysts expect Microsoft to roll out more Copilot and AI features into its consumer and enterprise product stack.\n\nWedbush said in its analyst note that it expects more AI integration with Microsoft apps like Excel, Teams, and Word, which will increase subscriptions and strengthen Microsoft's consumer base.\n\nOver 70% of Microsoft's installed base \"will ultimately be on this AI-driven functionality\" in the next three years, the analyst said, which will be a big change for the company.\n\nIves said putting AI features into Windows will give developers the foundation to build AI use cases through Windows and, ultimately, Azure.\n\nIves said in some ways, the most important aspect of the developer conference is going to be showing off the AI framework in Azure.\n\nIn its analyst note, Wedbush estimated that Microsoft's customers still have plenty of room to increase their spending with the company. For every $100 they spend on Azure, there is an estimated $35-$40 in potential additional AI spending, they wrote.\n\n\"Cloud is where the battleground is between Google, Oracle, Amazon,\" Ives said. \"Microsoft is showing developers to look no further than between us and OpenAI.\"\n\nWedbush analysts anticipate new laptops along with Windows updates this week.\n\nThe new hardware expected to be announced on Monday, the day before Build kicks off, could include the Surface Pro 10 and the Surface Laptop 6, The Verge reports. Both would run on Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite processors as the company transitions to Arm, The Verge said.\n\nNew processors would come as Microsoft and other PC companies have been under pressure to ramp up their processing chips since Apple transitioned to creating its own. Recent reports also indicate that Apple is working on revamping its entire Mac lineup with a series of new M4 processors that aim to put AI at their center.\n\nBut Microsoft's Surface updates may kick off the trend. Ives said the new AI Surface updates will start a new PC-driven cycle that's \"AI-led, from Dell to Microsoft, and ultimately to Apple as well.\"\n\nMicrosoft has big shoes to fill following OpenAI's spring update and Google's I/O conference last week. Both companies announced human-like updates to their AI products, showcasing their AI agent's ability to respond to prompts with voice and act as a tutor.\n\nGoogle also announced a revamped search engine integrated with AI, which competes with Microsft's AI-powered Bing.\n\nBut according to Ives, Microsoft will be a \"showstopper.\" Due to OpenAI's collaboration with Microsoft, Ives said the conference will build on OpenAI's announcements from last week.\n\nBusiness Insider will be liveblogging Microsoft's big opening keynote on Tuesday at 12 p.m. ET, so check back with us then to follow along.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_altchek@businessinsider.com", "name": "Ana Altchek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Surface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Excel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "output"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Update", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windows Update"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/664b58559fc063e829b2bda1?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Microsoft Paint is one of the lucky ones, gaining a new image generation power tool called Cocreator.\n\nCocreator, powered by \"diffusion-based algorithms,\" is able to generate images based on text prompts and doodles inside the Paint app.\n\nCocreator also comes with a \"creativity slider,\" that allows the user to control how much they want AI to take over, compared with the original art.\n\nMicrosoft has been playing around with the idea of AI image generation in Paint for a while. Early versions of Cocreator have been available to developers for a while. But now, the feature has become official with the introduction of Copilot+ PCs.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, a Copilot+ PC combines local, on-device AI with cloud AI in order to offer a range of services.\n\nSome of these new laptops will come with the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus processors. The NPU inside will power the AI functions, with over 45 trillion operations per second (TOPS).\n\nA Copilot+ PC requires 16GB RAM, 256GB storage, and an integrated NPU.\n\nMany of Microsoft's apps and services will now be based around AI and Copilot. The laptops will also come with a dedicated Copilot key for launching the service.\n\nOther AI features announced include Recall, which allows users to locate anything on the PC by describing it, Live Captions, Automatic Super Resolution, which automatically upscales graphics and video, adding detail.\n\nVideo Super Resolution works on devices with Nvidia GeForce RTX 20-series cards or newer, as well as AMD Radeon RX 5700 cards or newer.\n\nMicrosoft also appears to be improving Windows Studio Effects with additional filters.\n\nBack in September last year, The Verge reported that Microsoft released one of its biggest updates to Windows 11.\n\nThis update brought with it Copilot, as well as AI-powered updates to Paint, Snipping Tool, and Photos, RGB lighting support, and a modernised File Explorer.\n\nMicrosoft Paint gained Photoshop-like features, as well as support for transparency and layers.\n\nThis was also when the Cocreator feature was announced.\n\nIn a blog post at the time, Head of Consumer Marketing at Microsoft, Yusuf Mehdi said, \"Cocreator unleashes your creativity by simply inputting a text prompt, selecting a style, and generating a unique image. You can then use the array of other tools in Paint to further refine your creation, whether it's adding layers or drawing on top.\"", "source": {"uri": "channelnews.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "ChannelNews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashley_riordan@channelnews.com.au", "name": "Ashley Riordan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "varun_godinho@channelnews.com.au", "name": "Varun Godinho", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Paint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Paint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Surface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radeon_RX_5000_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radeon RX 5000 series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_RTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia RTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Explorer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "File Explorer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RGB color model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GeForce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.channelnews.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Microsoft-Paint-Logo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

But Microsoft announced that it's also partnering with Intel and AMD.\n\nAnd now we know when to expect some of the first Intel-powered Copilot+ PCs. Intel says it will release its Lunar Lake processor lineup during the third quarter of 2024, which means that PCs with the next-gen chips could hit the streets in time for the holiday season. And thanks to a next-gen NPU, at least some of these systems will meet Microsoft's minimum system requirements for Copilot+ PCs.\n\nAs a refresh, Microsoft says in order to qualify as a Copilot+ system, a computer needs to have:\n\nQualcomm's Snapdragon X chips have an NPU that delivers 45 TOPS of performance, so why did Microsoft set the bench below that? Probably because Intel says it's Lunar Lake processors will support \"more than 40 NPU tera operations per second (TOPS).\n\nThe company apparently knows that doesn't sound too impressive, so Intel is also noting that its next-gen chips will have integrated graphics that can offer \"over 60 GPU TOPS,\" for a total of \"more than 100 platform TOPS.\"\n\nBut as Microsoft pointed out during its Copilot+ PC announcement, part of the benefit of offloading AI tasks to dedicated hardware is that you can run those processes more efficiently... and another is that you can do it without dragging down GPU performance. That allowed Microsoft to show how Copilot could do things like offer suggested actions while you're playing a PC game without affecting frame rates in the game.\n\nAnyway, the larger point here is that PC makers don't need to opt for Qualcomm processors to build Copilot+ PCs. And Intel wants to make sure you know that not only will its first chips to support the platform be available soon, but that \"more than 80 new laptop designs\" from \"more than 20 original equipment manufacturers\" featuring the follow-up to its Meteor Lake chips are on the way.", "source": {"uri": "liliputing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liliputing"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brad_linder@liliputing.com", "name": "Brad Linder", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_requirements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "System requirements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PC game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Original equipment manufacturer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet_PCs", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet PCs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://liliputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/lunar-lake.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

In one example, a man had Copilot watch him play Minecraft -- and it give him tips, too.\n\nCopilot with GPT-4o will \"soon be available,\" according to Microsoft, but even without GPT-4o's underlying influence, there are still some Copilot updates that will catch your eye.\n\nShowing off Copilot's capabilities on a Surface device, Microsoft boasted that, with the AI chatbot, one can edit photo without needing to open an app.\n\nIn the demo, Microsoft boasted that you can click on a photo, and with Copilot integration, ask it to remove the background with a simple click.\n\nYou know those notifications you get on your desktop, whether it's a text or email?\n\nWell, with Copilot being your AI PC companion, it can give you a quick summary of those messages, so you can determine whether they're worth an urgent response.\n\nUsing the NPU that is packed inside the new Surface devices, the new AI-powered Recall feature lets users find anything that ever appeared on their screen by using natural language.\n\nFor example, let's say you were shopping for a new dress, and suddenly, you got sidetracked and forgot to bookmark your favorite one. With Recall, you can type something like \"blue dress\" -- and retrieve the webpage you failed to save in seconds.\n\nThe Surface event briefly touched upon how Copilot can sketch with you. In the demo below, you can see a user sketching their own version of a house in the middle of nowhere.\n\nCopilot can seemingly turn your humble sketch into a masterpiece. There is a sliding bar that lets you increase the \"creativity\" of your sketch and change the style of it, too (e.g., oil painting).\n\nMicrosoft also boasted that Copilot has the ability to run real-time translation on videos, allowing users to translate a number of languages into English -- with captions in tow.", "source": {"uri": "mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_officer_(aviation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First officer (aviation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surface Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_demo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Game demo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01cWThzBtyOllK0MjQs8vOA/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1716263187.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 381, "textEnd": 387}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

He witnessed an hour of demos and benchmarks, starting with a comparison of Geekbench and Cinebench, then moving on to apps and compatibility.\n\nBenchmark tests are usually not that fun to watch. But a lot was at stake here. For years, MacBook Air has also been available with Arm-powered and Intel-based PC chips. This time, however, Surface took the lead in the first test. He then won another Test, and then another. With the results of these tests, Microsoft believes it is in a position to conquer the laptop market.\n\nThis is the free version of Notepad, a newsletter that reveals Microsoft's era-defining bets in AI, gaming, and computing.\n\nStart your free trial of Notepad today and access all your stories.monthly\n\n$7/month\n\nGet every issue of Notepad delivered straight to your inbox.

Known as Copilot Plus PCs, they were intended to launch a generation of powerful, battery-efficient Windows laptops and lay the foundation for an AI-powered future.\n\nYou're getting the most powerful PC ever, Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft's executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer, said at the briefing. In fact, in terms of sustained performance, he outperforms any device, including his MacBook Air with an M3 processor, by more than 50%.\n\nMicrosoft is making some big promises regarding the performance of these new devices.Photo by Alison Johnson/The Verge\n\nEver since Apple moved to its own chips with the launch of M1 in 2020, Windows laptops have fallen far behind MacBooks in terms of performance and battery life. Microsoft's confidence level is astonishing, especially considering its difficult journey with Windows on Arm over the past decade. Microsoft first tried migrating Windows to Arm chips with the Surface RT in 2012, but performance was abysmal and app compatibility was virtually non-existent. The 2019 Surface Pro X launch was much better thanks to emulation improvements and fundamental Windows changes. It wasn't as good as the Apple M1 launch a few months later, but it was a sign of things to come, starting a close partnership with Qualcomm that now looks like it's finally paying off.\n\nThis is something we haven't experienced in over 20 years and never had high standards for owning the best performing device. Mehdi says it will happen.\n\nI won't be completely convinced until I spend enough time with these new Copilot Plus PCs, but everything Microsoft has shown me about performance and battery life is better than any Arm-powered Windows laptop that existed before today. seems light years ahead.\n\ncompatibility\n\nOne of the big advances is an improved emulator called Prism. Microsoft claims the emulator is as efficient as Apple's Rosetta 2 translation layer and can emulate apps twice as fast as previous generations of Windows on Arm devices.\n\nWe spent a lot of energy here. Pavan Davuluri, head of Windows and Surface, said that for apps that aren't yet native, they can now take advantage of Prism's capabilities and solve problems with improved emulator energy, platform and performance efficiencies. I am.\n\nThis should make it more efficient than previous emulators, but Microsoft has been vague about its promises in this regard, so don't expect a huge leap forward. In any case, emulation still has its limits. Apple's success with M1 is due to developers quickly porting their apps fully natively. Windows needs the same level of support from its developer community.\n\nFortunately for Microsoft, two major changes have occurred in recent years. First, many of the biggest apps now natively support Arm chips. Top entertainment apps like Photoshop, Dropbox, Zoom, Spotify, and even Prime and Hulu are all native ARM64 apps today. Second, Google and many other browser manufacturers are moving to ARM64. A native version of Chrome was recently released, and just last week Opera was released. Firefox, Vivaldi, Brave, and Microsoft Edge are also all ARM64 native, so you won't experience any performance degradation in any browser. This is a big problem considering that many apps are now web-based and we spend more time than ever inside the browser.\n\nMicrosoft has been working with app developers to prepare native ARM64 apps.Photo: Alison Johnson/The Verge\n\nOverall, Microsoft believes that 87% of the total app time spent on these Copilot Plus PCs will be within native apps. We're still working on solving the remaining 13 percent, but in the meantime, the Prism emulator can help.\n\nHowever, all that app compatibility and performance means nothing without battery life. Microsoft uses scripts to simulate web browsing. On a 2022 Intel-based Surface Laptop 5, it took 8 hours and 38 minutes to completely drain the battery. The new Surface Copilot Plus PC lasted three times as long, at 16 hours and 56 minutes. This is an incredible increase in efficiency, even beating the same test of 15 hours and 25 minutes on a 15-inch MacBook Air M3. That's another hour and a half.\n\nMicrosoft ran similar tests for video playback, reaching over 20 hours on the Surface Copilot Plus PC and 17 hours and 45 minutes on the MacBook Air M3. That's nearly 8 hours longer than his 12 hours and 30 minutes on the Surface Laptop 5. If these battery improvements extend beyond basic web browsing and video playback, this would be a significant improvement for Windows laptops.\n\nA.I.\n\nThese Copilot Plus PCs are equipped with Qualcomm's Neural Processing Unit (NPU), which delivers 45 TOPS of computing power for AI tasks. The result is more AI task operations per watt than the MacBook Air M3 or Nvidias RTX 4060.\n\nMicrosoft is also integrating more than 40 AI models directly into Windows on Arm, delivering new experiences within Windows and for app developers. About 10 of them are small language models that run in the background. These models allow developers to build his AI experiences directly into their apps, and Microsoft's battery life measurements include continuous execution on the NPU.\n\nThese really open the door to new possibilities for AI experiences, Davuluri says. NPUs give us the magic of being able to run fairly high performance workloads. Microsoft demonstrated its new Recall feature on stage today. This feature essentially allows you to time travel to whatever you were watching or working on on your PC. This all happens in the background and there's an explorable timeline thanks to these AI models that catalog all the work you're doing.\n\nNew recall feature for Copilot Plus PC.Image: Microsoft\n\nWindows 11's Live Captioning feature also includes AI-powered Live Translation, which allows you to translate any video in real-time. Microsoft is also adding Auto Super Resolution to Windows 11, which automatically upscales games to improve frame rate and graphics resolution.\n\nAlthough AI capabilities within Windows are still in their infancy, Microsoft has built new kernels and compilers for these Arm-based chips. It's a rework of the core of Windows on Arm, delivering a faster experience and potentially unlocking a new wave of AI capabilities and apps.\n\nSometimes, Mehdi says, when technology changes and you're trying to discover something, you get an opportunity to work on something special. I think we may have moments like that too.\n\nAcer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung will all launch new Copilot Plus PCs with Qualcomm processors first. If everything Microsoft showed me holds up in real-world testing, this is a monumental moment for Windows laptops, and one that will have as much impact as any new release of Windows itself.\n\nTom Warren's Notepad /\n\nWeekly newsletter revealing the secrets and strategies behind Microsoft's era-defining bets in AI, gaming, and computing\n\nsubscribe\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emulator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple M1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AArch64"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_4D", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema 4D"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Laptop_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surface Laptop 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firefox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4iLJrM8yk7n6Zo6t6jP_lbXxG9s=/0x0:1200x900/1200x628/filters:focal(600x450:601x451)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25456849/RW1iUuD.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

As it does on occasion, the company has decided not to livestream the event. Windows Central reports that it will begin at 1 pm Eastern time (10 am Pacific time) and last about an hour.\n\nThe company used its X (formerly Twitter) account to post a teaser for that event, claiming, \"A new era is coming.\" It also has a microsoft.com/event URL that, when you head to that address, takes you to the Microsoft Surface site at the moment.\n\nThat should be a big clue that the event will reveal new Surface devices. The rumor mill claims that Microsoft will announce consumer versions of its Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 models that were previously announced in March in their business models.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, the new Surface models are rumored to have Qualcomm's previously announced Snapdragon X Elite processors. They will include a neural processing unit designed to boost AI apps and features like Microsoft's Copilot assistant. It's also likely that Microsoft will use the occasion to reveal some new upcoming Windows 11 updates and features.\n\nASUS will be holding its own announcement on May 20, starting at 2 pm Eastern time (11 am Pacific time). That event will be live-streamed, and the company's press release says it will reveal a new \"AI PC\" laptop that will be \"a collaboration between Microsoft, Qualcomm, and ASUS.\"\n\nBuild 2024 - May 21-23\n\nThe annual Build 2024 developers conference from Microsoft will be held in Seattle as well from May 21-23. Unlike the company's May 20 press event, it will livestream many of its events on the Microsoft YouTube channel.\n\nThe big ones to watch for are the two keynote addresses, with the first starting at noon Eastern time (9 am Pacific) on May 21. It will feature Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, the company's chief technology officer Kevin Scott, and its Executive Vice President for Experiences and Devices, Rajesh Jha.\n\nThe second keynote will be held on May 22 at 11:30 am Eastern time (8:30 am Pacific time). It will feature Microsoft's Executive Vice President for Cloud and AI, Scott Guthrie, and other company executives.

The company showcased how it will work with the latter at its big Surface and AI event earlier today, and the results are pretty wild. In a demonstration, Microsoft showed how Copilot can act as a digital assistant that you can verbally interact with to provide in-game information, help, and tips.\n\nIn Minecraft, it could be as simple as asking for a crafting recipe. Copilot can then step you through the process and even assess your inventory to provide answers on what you might need and where to find it. The whole presentation included a scenario where Copilot acted as an interactive guide for a player looking to craft a sword. It's filled with rich, naturalistic conversational delivery and is impressive, to say the least - watch a short clip of it above.\n\nIt's reminiscent of some AI tutors and educational tools that OpenAI has demonstrated - except this time, it's for gaming. This feature will undoubtedly make its way to Xbox consoles and hardware, but as it will require NPU hardware to run, it probably won't arrive for televisions until Microsoft launches its next-gen Xbox console.\n\nUnless, of course, Microsoft offers a cloud-based solution for Xbox gamers. Microsoft's new Surface Pro and Surface Laptop devices are part of the latest Snapdragon X Copilot+ AI PC lineup, so the Minecraft demonstration is presumably running locally on the Qualcomm Hexagon NPU with 45 TOPS of AI performance.\n\nMicrosoft is placing a big emphasis on privacy and ensuring that its Copilot tools run locally. Microsoft is said to roll out this new feature in Minecraft first, with other games to follow. Will it spell the end of game guides, looking up YouTube clips to find secrets, or how to take out a challenging boss? For some games, yes. For others, AI could take over and play difficult sections to get you to the next level.\n\nHow gamers choose to embrace AI assistants and other tools remains to be seen.", "source": {"uri": "tweaktown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TweakTown"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kosta_andreadis@tweaktown.com", "name": "Kosta Andreadis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_digital_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal digital assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PC game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xbox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boss (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Hexagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Hexagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Surface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Puzzle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Puzzle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Software", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Educational", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://static.tweaktown.com/news/9/8/98413_01_microsofts-copilot-ai-is-being-integrated-into-games-like-minecraft-to-help-gamers-play_full.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Its partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI allowed it to jump ahead of Alphabet, as other Big Tech companies race to dominate the emerging field.\n\nLast week, OpenAI and Alphabet's Google showcased dueling AI technologies that can respond via voice in real time and be interrupted, both hallmarks of realistic voice conversations that AI voice assistants have found challenging. Google also announced it was rolling out several generative AI features to its lucrative search engine.\n\nThe PC industry has been under increasing pressure from Apple since the company launched its custom chips based on designs from Arm and ditched Intel's processors. The Apple-designed processors have given Mac computers superior battery life and speedier performance than rivals' chips that use more energy.\n\nMicrosoft tapped Qualcomm to lead the effort to move the Windows operating system to Arm's chip designs in 2016.

These new Snapdragon-powered PCs are branded \"Copilot+ PCs,\" and this first wave of devices will bring over 20 models from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung, and Microsoft.\n\nJust like Intel came up with the \"ultrabook\" marketing term for ultrathin laptops competing with Apple's MacBook Air, the new \"Copilot+\" brand of AI PCs has been created to promote a new category of mobile PCs delivering multiple days of battery life and unique AI experiences. And Qualcomm claims that its new Snapdragon X Series chip delivers unparalleled performance per watt and the world's fastest neural processing unit (NPU) for laptops.\n\nOne of the new AI features that will be available on these first Copilot+ PCs is named \"Recall.\" If you remember the now-deprecated Timeline feature on Windows 10, Recall will let users scroll back in time and find apps, documents, messages, and more that they previously used on the device. The feature is powered by different small language models, and Microsoft said it won't be using user data to train these models.\n\nQualcomm previously shared all the technical details regarding its Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips. The Snapdragon X Plus comes with 10 CPU cores running at up to 3.4Ghz, and compared to a 16-core Intel Core Ultra 7 155H CPU, Qualcomm promises up to 37% faster CPU performance while consuming up to 54% less power. The Snapdragon X Elite, however, comes has 12 CPU cores running at a higher maximum multithread frequency, and there's also a Dual Core Boost feature on select SKUs. However, both chips share the same \"Hexagon\" NPU delivering 45 TOPS (Tera Operations per Second) of AI performance.\n\n\"It's a new era for the PC and our collaboration with Microsoft combines the power of Snapdragon X Series with the power of Copilot+ to deliver groundbreaking AI capabilities that are redefining the personal computing experience - all with industry-leading performance and\n\nmulti-day battery life,\" said Alex Katouzian, Group General Manager, Mobile, Compute & XR, Qualcomm Technologies. \"Today, our global OEM partners launched the first Copilot+ PCs exclusively powered by Snapdragon X Series in a variety of form factors and at multiple price points. We're proud to enable this industry shift, which puts Windows PCs at the forefront of technology and allows users to push the boundaries of what's possible across productivity, creativity, and entertainment.\"\n\nTo be clear, there will also be \"Copilot+\" PCs with Intel and AMD chips, but the first models are all Qualcomm-powered. The base specs to qualify as a \"Copilot+\" PC include 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an NPU reaching 40+ TOPS of AI performance.\n\nYou can find below the main details about the first Copilot+ PCs powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips coming later this summer.\n\nThe Acer Swift 14 will introduce a refined design with an Activity indicator on the touchpad that lights up when the device or Copilot is activated.

It will not be live-streamed.\n\nMicrosoft aims to extend its early advantage in the race to produce AI tools that consumers are willing to pay for. Its partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI allowed it to jump ahead of Alphabet, as other Big Tech companies race to dominate the emerging field.\n\nLast week, OpenAI and Alphabet's Google showcased dueling AI technologies that can respond via voice in real time and be interrupted, both hallmarks of realistic voice conversations that AI voice assistants have found challenging. Google also announced it was rolling out several generative AI features to its lucrative search engine.\n\nThe PC industry has been under increasing pressure from Apple since the company launched its custom chips based on designs from Arm and ditched Intel's processors.

Since the company is a dominant player in the Generative AI market as a major investor in OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, the announcement is garnering attention in the tech industry. With Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics, HP, Lenovo, and Apple jumping into the AI PC market, the industry predicts that the AI PC will be the savior of the PC market experiencing slow demand recovery.\n\nCNBC reported on Sunday (local time) that Microsoft will unveil its vision for AI PCs at its Build developer conference, which will be held from Tuesday through Thursday. According to CNBC, the tech giant will announce how AI will be utilized in Windows and what more can be done with AI PCs.\n\nLast year, Microsoft launched Copilot, an AI model based on OpenAI's model. In March this year, the company launched a PC and laptop with a keyboard that has a button for Copilot as its basic setting. The tech industry is expecting a more evolved technological strategy to be announced. \"This year will be the first year when AI becomes an essential feature for all PCs,\" said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in January this year, forewarning heavy competition in the AI PC market.\n\nAI PCs refer to those specialized for AI-related work, such as computation and machine learning. Recently launched AI PCs focus on the on-device function, which enables the use of AI without an Internet connection, reducing issues with data transfer or private information leakage. A market research firm, Canalys, predicted that about 48 million AI PCs will be marketed this year and that AI PCs will account for approximately 70 percent of all PCs in the market by 2028. AI PCs have now become undeniable in the mainstream.\n\nSome point out the limitations that there aren't many AI features or applications that can be run on AI PCs, arguing that more reasons should be created for users to choose AI PCs. \"When smartphones first came out, there weren't a lot of apps. However, with the increased availability of various apps, smartphones became mainstream. More apps and services should be developed to draw users to AI PCs,\" said an industry source. \"Consumers will choose attractive products regarding price, design, and graphic performance.\"", "source": {"uri": "donga.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.donga.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Electronics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Electronics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LG Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer keyboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://dimg.donga.com/ugc/CDB/ENGLISH/Article/66/4b/dc/28/664bdc2808a3d273823e.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

The result is the fastest, most AI-ready Windows PCs ever built,\" he added.\n\nOf all the tech giants, Microsoft has pushed the most aggressively to infuse the powers of generative AI into its products, often leaving rival Google to play catch-up.\n\nChatGPT-style AI, which is called Copilot at Microsoft, is available across the company's products, including Teams, Outlook and its Windows operating system.\n\nMicrosoft even tried, so far unsuccessfully, to rejuvenate Bing, its online search engine, with generative AI powers.\n\nThe pivot to AI has been celebrated by Wall Street, with Microsoft now the world's biggest company by market capitalization, taking the spot from Apple.\n\nNadella's announcement on AI comes on the heels of those made by Google and ChatGPT-maker Open AI last week.\n\nThe companies showcased updates to their chatbots, featuring more human-like interactions and new abilities to understand their surroundings via video, though the innovations are not yet available to users.\n\nGoogle also announced it was adding AI answers to its world leading search engine, despite fears it may eat into its advertising revenues.\n\nMicrosoft is OpenAI's main investor and has injected some $13 billion in the form of cloud computing credits that fulfill the ChatGPT-makers huge needs for computing.\n\nAnalysts believe that the hunger for AI products is helping buoy Microsoft and Google's cloud computing businesses, with clients ready to pay a premium to adopt ChatGPT-like capabilities.\n\nIn a note to clients, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said that AI will add $25 billion-$30 billion to Microsoft's sales by 2025.\n\n\"The spending on AI is unprecedented across the tech world and this is just the first phase of the AI Revolution playing out,\" Ives said.\n\nMicrosoft's injection of AI into PC's and devices comes just ahead of an Apple event next month that is widely expected to see ChatGPT's abilities feature in a new iPhone.\n\nMedia reports also signal that Apple could announce a partnership between Apple and OpenAI.\n\nThe tech giants are racing the products out the door despite worries that generative Ai poses a threat to society.\n\nAuthorities, including in the usually low-regulated US, are drawing up ways to more closely track the developments in AI, and potentially put limits on its deployment.", "source": {"uri": "legit.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Legit.ng -

This, according to Wedbush, marks the beginning of a new AI-driven PC refresh, which Microsoft plans to focus on over the next 12 to 18 months, targeting more consumers.\n\n\"With Build being a developer conference we expect a heavy focus on Azure and Microsoft's AI enterprise endeavors which along with OpenAI are leading the path on this AI Revolution,\" analysts said.\n\nWedbush said last week marked a key moment for the AI revolution, as both OpenAI and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) revealed their latest AI technologies to developers and users. OpenAI caught attention with its innovative AI features, while Google, at their I/O event, unveiled several announcements demonstrating their own AI capabilities, which will be led by Gemini and new advancements in search technology.\n\n\"The spending on AI is unprecedented across the tech world and this is just the first phase of the AI Revolution playing out with a major missing piece in this AI puzzle coming from Microsoft and Nadella this week at Build and Apple at WWDC next month,\" analysts said.\n\n\"Based on our recent work in the field we believe the next 3 years over 70% of its MSFT installed base will ultimately be on this AI driven functionality for the enterprise/commercial which changes the landscape for Nadella & Co going forward,\" analysts added.\n\nWedbush believes that MSFT stock is yet to fully price in the upcoming cloud and AI growth.

During its Build event, the company made some exciting announcements, such as the launch of a Copilot+ PC lineup and artificial intelligence updates coming to Copilot. The company also announced Recall AI, a feature Microsoft describes as photographic memory for your PC.\n\nAlso: Is Apple sweating yet? Every Windows laptop launching with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite\n\nThe Recall AI feature allows users to ask about a file, website, or email using their voice. For example, you could ask it to find that email from your boss with the conference schedule you got last week or to pull up a note about something you wrote down -- without needing to use the PC's search option.\n\nRecall records the user's screen and indexes the information to make it searchable with AI. Instead of searching for the exact name on a file, you can describe what you remember about it, like 'the PDF that discussed employee onboarding' in natural language as if you were talking to a coworker. It also makes it easier to find a document's latest version quickly.\n\nThe feature captures what you do on your PC, but Microsoft ensures that the data stays local on the device, so you don't have to worry about your information going to cloud servers. The company also says it won't use any of the captured information to train AI models. Users can also view, edit, and delete anything captured and scroll through the timeline to find what they need.\n\nAlso: I went hands-on with Lenovo's new Snapdragon X Elite laptops, and they're scary thin\n\nRecall AI will only be available on Copilot+ PCs at this time, as it requires some hefty hardware to run on-device.

Qualcomm will be working with several hardware OEM manufacturers including Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung, and Microsoft itself to bring a variety of devices powered by the company's new Snapdragon X series of PC chips.\n\nThe reason for this Copilot+ PC push is that these devices will now come with NPUs (Neural Processing Units) onboard, alongside traditional CPU and GPU engines users are accustomed to working with. It's also why Microsoft seems to be favoring Qualcomm, as the company claims that its Snapdragon X Elite processor bests Apple's M3 by up to 2.6X and Intel's Core Ultra 7 by 5.4X with its NPU performance per watt.\n\nWith this new direction for PCs, Microsoft says that \"We have completely reimagined the entirety of the PC - from silicon to the operating system, the application layer to the cloud - with AI at the center, marking the most significant change to the Window platform in decades.\"\n\nUltimately, this means users will have access to SLMs (Small Language Models) than run on device, while also tapping into Microsoft's Azure Cloud services for a more tightly integrated AI experience. Applications such as Microsoft 365 apps, Adobe, Davinci Resolve Studio, Capcut, Caphable, LiquidTextd, djay Pro will all be tapping into these new AI capabilities to increase user productivity.\n\nThis is a big shift for the PC industry, and Qualcomm has shown it means business with its custom Arm-core based PC platform solution chips, especially if it's able to get this sort of preferential lime light by Microsoft as a key ecosystem partner.

It's also quite impressive as to the sheer number of PC designs Qualcomm is chalking up today, with virtually all the major OEMs represented, some with their flagship models now offering a Snapdragon X variant.

This, according to Wedbush, marks the beginning of a new AI-driven PC refresh, which Microsoft plans to focus on over the next 12 to 18 months, targeting more consumers.\n\n\"With Build being a developer conference we expect a heavy focus on Azure and Microsoft's AI enterprise endeavors which along with OpenAI are leading the path on this AI Revolution,\" analysts said.\n\nWedbush said last week marked a key moment for the AI revolution, as both OpenAI and Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) revealed their latest AI technologies to developers and users. OpenAI caught attention with its innovative AI features, while Google, at their I/O event, unveiled several announcements demonstrating their own AI capabilities, which will be led by Gemini and new advancements in search technology.\n\n\"The spending on AI is unprecedented across the tech world and this is just the first phase of the AI Revolution playing out with a major missing piece in this AI puzzle coming from Microsoft and Nadella this week at Build and Apple at WWDC next month,\" analysts said.\n\n\"Based on our recent work in the field we believe the next 3 years over 70% of its MSFT installed base will ultimately be on this AI driven functionality for the enterprise/commercial which changes the landscape for Nadella & Co going forward,\" analysts added.\n\nWedbush believes that MSFT stock is yet to fully price in the upcoming cloud and AI growth. The company's AI enterprise use cases are projected to drive more budget allocation in 2024/2025. The firm said its partner checks around Copilot deployments suggest this could add $25 billion-$30 billion to Microsoft's revenue by fiscal year 2025.", "source": {"uri": "in.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Excel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Update", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Windows Update"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "output"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puzzle video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/akapi-images/800x450/9c2f27bfd074aa53d063bdc79cfbefcc_w_800_h_450.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

However, most of those Copilot tools were designed to be used by individuals. Today, as part of its Build 2024 conference announcements, Microsoft revealed its plans to launch what it calls Team Copilot for Microsoft 365 users.\n\nMicrosoft stated:\n\nAs a valuable new team member, Team Copilot will work with teams to transform collaboration and workflows, and take on administrative tasks that are often time-consuming and costly for teams.\n\nSome of the features that will be put into Team Copilot include what the company calls a Meeting facilitator. This feature will allow the Team Copilot AI to manage the agenda for an online meeting and even take notes during the event. Anyone participating in the meeting will be able to co-author those notes. The feature will also support ad-hoc meeting support from Teams Rooms.\n\nAnother Team Copilot feature is called Group Moderator. This function will let Team Copilot summarize the most important information for a team or group and can even respond to questions from individual group members about their tasks.\n\nFinally, the service will include a way for Team Copilot to become a project manager. Microsoft says the AI assistant will use the Planner app in Teams to assign tasks to other members, track a group's upcoming deadline, and also send messages to group members if their input is needed for a collaboration project, via the Loop app.\n\nMicrosoft plans to launch a preview version of Team Copilot sometime later in 2024. Businesses and organizations who want to try this latest AI assistant must already have a Copilot for Microsoft 365 license set up.

For example, it can be used to open apps or edit photos. Copilot will also be visible in the Windows 11 taskbar.\n\nMicrosoft's latest suite of AI integrations comes as players in Big Tech are trying to plant their flag in the AI race. Last week at Google I/O, the search giant Google made a suite of Gemini -- the company's AI chatbot -- announcements centered around its integrations into all things Google. This included everything from AI summarizations in Google Search to the ambitious agentive Project Astra. OpenAI, the creators of ChatGPT, also showed off a new update to its large language model called GPT-4o last week that can handle more data. It demoed a voice-operated AI assistant that conversed in uniquely human ways, with vocal quirks, sarcasm and a flirty disposition. It reminded audiences so much of the movie Her, starring Scarlett Johansson as an AI chatbot, that OpenAI suspended the voice.\n\nThe stock market has been generously rewarding companies that are making the biggest impacts in the AI race. Nvidia saw its stock sore last year, briefly joining the trillion-dollar club, as its tech powers many of the AI engines companies use. Meta, Google and Microsoft have also seen record jumps in their stock price as they continue to invest billions of dollars in AI. Apple may or may not be creating its own commercial AI tech, but recently has been rumored to be shopping between Google and OpenAI to bring their tech to the iPhone.

At a recent unveiling of \"AI PCs,\" Microsoft claimed that its AI, Copilot, can help players in certain video games in real time, but its effectiveness in real-world scenarios remains to be seen.\n\nWhile revealing its new AI-powered Surface laptops this week, Microsoft shared a demonstration where the device's Copilot onboard AI offered real-time tips in games like Minecraft and Sea of Thieves. The fully voiced digital assistant appeared to conduct a natural conversation and react to in-game events.\n\nIn one video, a Minecraft player asks Copilot how to craft a sword. The AI can see what items are in the player's inventory and suggests that they still need to collect some wood or stone. Another video shows zombies attacking the player. Copilot quickly shifts to an alarmed tone of voice and advises the player to either find shelter or build a barrier to stay out of their reach.\n\nIt isn't clear which games Copilot will support, but a screenshot from Windows Central suggests it can also help with Sea of Thieves. If the AI must be tailored on a per-game basis, it might debut for specific Microsoft-published titles.\n\nStressing an emphasis on privacy, Microsoft stated that all of the information Copilot gathers for in-game assistance will remain on the device. The company won't upload data to the cloud or use it to train AI models.\n\nReal-time guides are somewhat different from other AI-based applications for video games. The most successful gaming-related uses for the technology have been machine-learning-assisted upscaling and frame generation - features that dramatically improve performance. Meanwhile, Nvidia has proposed filling games with AI-controlled characters that can react to a wide range of player input.\n\nConversely, in-game assistance would presumably be optional, and wouldn't directly affect a game's content. However, some might express concern over the feature's impact on hand-written guides.\n\nHallucination is another risk to consider. So far, developers have been unsuccessful in stopping AI-based chatbots from confidently stating false information. The recently unveiled AI summaries for Google search were immediately caught hallucinating, so there's a good chance the same could happen to Copilot's game assistant.\n\nMicrosoft's Surface Pro Copilot+ PC will begin shipping in mid-June, starting at $999.99. The PC uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite processor to run an Arm-based version of Windows.

The machines, Microsoft says, will run AI systems on chips and other gear inside the computers so they are faster, more personal and more private.\n\nThe new computers, called Copilot+ PC, will allow people to use AI to make it easier to find documents and files they have worked on, emails they have read or websites they have browsed. Their AI systems will also automate tasks such as photo editing and language translation.\n\nThe new design will be included in Microsoft's Surface laptops and high-end products that run on the Windows operating system offered by Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung, some of the largest PC makers in the world.\n\nThe AI PC, industry analysts believe, could reverse a longtime decline in the importance of the personal computer. For the past two decades, the demand for the fastest laptops has diminished because so much software was moved into cloud computing centers. A strong internet connection and web browser was all most people needed.\n\nBut AI stretches that long-distance relationship to its limits. ChatGPT and other generative AI tools are run in data centers stuffed with expensive and sophisticated chips that can process the largest, most advanced systems. Even the most cutting-edge chatbots take time to receive a query, process it and send back a response. It is also extremely expensive to manage.\n\nMicrosoft wants to run AI systems directly on a personal computer to eliminate that lag time and cut the price. Microsoft has been shrinking the size of AI systems, called models, to make them easier to run outside of data centers. It said more than 40 will run directly on the laptops. The smaller models are generally not as powerful or accurate as the most cutting-edge AI systems, but they are improving enough to be useful to the average consumer.\n\n\"We are entering a new era where computers not only understand us, but can anticipate what we want and our intents,\" said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at an event at its headquarters in Redmond, Washington.\n\nAnalysts expect Apple to follow suit next month at its conference for software developers, where the company will announce an overhaul for Siri, its virtual assistant, and an overall strategy for integrating more AI capabilities into its laptops and iPhones.\n\nWhether the AI PC takes off depends on the companies' ability to create compelling reasons for buyers to upgrade. The initial sales of these new computers, which cost more than $1,000, will be small, said Linn Huang, an analyst at IDC, which closely tracks the market. But by the end of the decade -- assuming AI tools turn out to be useful -- they will be \"ubiquitous,\" he predicted. \"Everything will be an AI PC.\"\n\nThe computer industry is looking for a jolt. Consumers have been upgrading their own computers less frequently, as the music and photos they once stored on their machines now often live online, on Spotify, Netflix or iCloud. Computer purchases by companies, schools and other institutions have finally stabilized after booming -- and then crashing -- during the pandemic.\n\nSome high-end smartphones have been integrating AI chips, but the sales have fallen short because the features \"are still not sophisticated enough to catalyze a faster upgrade cycle,\" Mehdi Hosseini, an analyst at Susquehanna International Group, wrote in a research note. It will be at least another year, he said, before enough meaningful breakthroughs will lead consumers to take note.\n\nAt the event, Microsoft showed new laptops with what it likened to having a photographic memory. Users can ask Copilot, Microsoft's chatbot, to use a feature called Recall to look up a file by typing a question using natural language, such as, \"Can you find me a video call I had with Joe recently where he was holding an 'I Love New York' coffee mug?\" The computer will then immediately be able to retrieve the file containing those details because the AI systems are constantly scanning what the user does on the laptop.\n\n\"It remembers things that I forget,\" said Matt Barlow, Microsoft's head of marketing for Surface computers, in an interview.\n\nMicrosoft said the information used for this Recall function was stored directly on the laptop for privacy, and would not be sent back to the company's servers or be used in training future AI systems. Pavan Davuluri, a Microsoft executive overseeing Windows, said that with the Recall system users would also be able to opt out of sharing certain types of information, such as visits to a specific website, but that some sensitive data, such as financial information and private browsing sessions, would not be monitored by default.\n\nMicrosoft also demonstrated live transcripts that translate in real time, which it said would be available on any video that streams across a laptop's screen.\n\nMicrosoft last month released AI models small enough to run on a phone that it said performed almost as well as GPT-3.5, the much larger system that initially underpinned OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot when it debuted in late 2022.\n\n(The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in December for copyright infringement of news content related to AI systems.)\n\nChipmakers have also made advances, like adjusting a laptop's battery life to allow for the enormous number of calculations that AI demands. The new computers have dedicated chips built by Qualcomm, the largest chip provider for smartphones.\n\nThough the type of chip inside the new AI computers, known as a neural processing unit, specializes in handling complex AI tasks, such as generating images and summarizing documents, the benefits may still be unnoticeable to consumers, said Subbarao Kambhampati, a professor and researcher of artificial intelligence at Arizona State University.\n\nMost of the data processing for AI still has to be done on a company's servers instead of directly on the devices, so it's still important that people have a fast internet connection, he added.\n\nBut the neural processing chips also speed up other tasks, such as video editing or the ability to use a virtual background inside a video call, said Brad Linder, editor of Liliputing, a blog that has covered computers for nearly two decades. So, even if people don't buy into the hype surrounding artificial intelligence, they may end up getting an AI computer for other reasons.", "source": {"uri": "wral.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Intel and AMD are still catching up.\n\nTo deliver the high demand for HPC, Microsoft announced its intention to provide its cloud computing clients with AI chips developed by AMD.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft will unveil a preview of its new Cobalt 100 custom processors at the upcoming conference. These chips, first announced in November, reportedly deliver a 40% performance improvement over other ARM-designed competitors. Companies such as Adobe and Snowflake are already utilising these processors.\n\nDuring a keynote speech, Microsoft introduced the Copilot+ PC, their brand of AI PCs. This sets specific hardware requirements for systems to qualify as 'AI-first' PCs. These PCs will have the capability to manage certain AI-accelerated tasks, such as chatbots and image generation locally, rather than depending on cloud services.\n\nHowever, new hardware will be necessary to execute these tasks swiftly and efficiently. For this, Microsoft has announced a partnership with Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm to build neural processing units (NPUs), allowing these AI models to run locally on PCs.\n\nAt a minimum, systems will need 16GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD to meet the memory and on-disk storage requirements for LLMs such as Microsoft's Phi-3. Microsoft has announced that all PCs powered by the Snapdragon X Plus and X Elite chips will have Copilot+ features pre-installed. According to Microsoft, they will start shipping on June 18th.\n\nDuring the keynote speech, Microsoft said that the Copilot+ PC runs 58% faster than the MacBook Air M3 in sustained multi-threaded performance on Snapdragon X Elite.\n\nAll this sounds fine for now for Intel and AMD.\n\nHowever, the most significant new requirement, which will pose a challenge for almost all existing Windows PCs, is the need for an integrated NPU. Microsoft mandates an NPU with a performance rating of 40 trillion operations per second (TOPS), a benchmark used by Microsoft, Qualcomm, Apple, and others in comparing NPU capabilities.\n\nThe challenge for Intel and AMD is that none of their current-generation chips meet this requirement, even those equipped with NPUs. Intel's Meteor Lake-based Core Ultra NPUs peak at 10 TOPS, while some of AMD's Ryzen 7000 and Ryzen 8000 desktop and laptop processors with NPUs range between 12 and 16 TOPS.\n\nCurrently, this requirement is met by only one chip in the Windows PC ecosystem: Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus. These chips, set to launch in the new Surface PCs and offerings from Dell, Lenovo, HP, Asus, Acer, and other major OEMs in the coming months, feature NPUs capable of 45 TOPS, slightly exceeding Microsoft's minimum requirement.\n\nIn comparison, Apple's latest M4 processor is capable of 38 TOPS of NPU performance.\n\nWhile both Intel and AMD have future products in their roadmap aimed at enhancing NPU performance to meet Microsoft's Copilot+ PC requirements, none of the existing hundreds of millions of x86-based Windows PCs, including current models available for purchase, will qualify for the Copilot+ label.\n\nIntel and AMD's CPUs and GPUs can add to the total TOPS a system can achieve. However, NPUs are specialised hardware designed to execute AI workloads more efficiently and with lower power consumption.\n\nAs mentioned before, both Intel and AMD have plans in the pipeline to meet these requirements. Intel has revealed that starting from the third quarter of 2024, its highly anticipated client processors, codenamed Lunar Lake, are slated to power over 80 fresh laptop designs across more than 20 OEMs.\n\nLunar Lake is boasting over three times the AI performance of its predecessors. With an impressive 40+ NPU TOPS, Intel's next-gen processors are poised to deliver the capabilities required for the upcoming Copilot+ experiences. Moreover, Lunar Lake will feature over 60 GPU TOPS, amounting to more than 100 platform TOPS in total.\n\nSimilarly, AMD is also coming up with its new APU, the Ryzen 8050, featuring a Zen 5 CPU and an XDNA 2 NPU architecture for AI PC workloads. This will boast a performance of around 50 TOPS, more than ideal for running Microsoft's AI PC goals. These have been dubbed the Strix Point APUs. AMD is expected to launch these by the second half of 2024.\n\nOnce released, the two will try to outcompete each other as to who can offer better AI PC goals. Meanwhile, Qualcomm, with its Snapdragon X Plus and X Elite chips, will start shipping by the end of next month.\n\nThis is all while NVIDIA criticises Microsoft's AI PC conversations. The company said that its GPUs provide better performance than any NPUs in the market, calling all other NPUs only good enough for 'basic' AI tasks. It also claims that its RTX GPUs can achieve between 100 to 1,300 TOPS of power, depending on the GPU.", "source": {"uri": "analyticsindiamag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Analytics India Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mohit_pandey@analyticsindiamag.com", "name": "Mohit Pandey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhood_planning_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neighborhood planning unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOPS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TOPS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supercomputer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thread (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solid-state drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Original equipment manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_APU", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AMD APU"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://8f430952.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Microsoft-Shows-Love-for-Intel-and-AMD-But-Chooses-Qualcomm-For-AI-PCs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 1524, "textEnd": 1533}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Lenovo, Samsung, Dell, HP, Acer, and Asus will introduce their takes on the Copilot+ PC around a month from now, all featuring either the X Elite or the slightly less powerful X Plus, which supposedly has the same AI performance as its sibling.\n\n\"I won't be fully convinced until I've spent enough time with one of these new Copilot+ PCs, but everything Microsoft showed me around performance and battery life looks lightyears ahead of the Arm-powered Windows laptops that existed before today,\" The Verge's Tom Warren cautiously enthused after a Microsoft briefing. \"If everything Microsoft showed me holds up in real-world testing, this is a monumental moment for Windows laptops -- with just as big an impact as a new release of Windows itself.\"\n\nWarren is not wrong -- this really could be a pivotal point in the PC story.\n\nIf the Copilot+ hardware push works as planned, the most obvious loser would be Apple, whose M-series chips have in recent years provided a huge selling point for MacBooks. Windows PCs being able to catch up on the power-plus-longevity front would be a huge deal for Microsoft. And if they also prove more capable at handling on-device generative AI, that would be yet another way in which Apple is struggling to keep up in the AI field. (Keeping AI on-device has privacy benefits, and is just plain faster than having to access the cloud when it comes to simple tasks like translation and summarization.)\n\nAnother big loser in this scenario is Intel, which increasingly looks like a legacy company entering its twilight years. This isn't the first time that Intel's x86 processor technology has been threatened by Arm's rival technology in the Windows PC space, but Microsoft's support for Windows on Arm has always seemed half-hearted, with developers left unsure of how much they should commit to the concept.\n\nThat doesn't seem to be the case anymore, with Microsoft enthusiastically touting buy-in from developers like Adobe and BlackMagic Design, whose products are wildly popular with the MacBook-toting creative crowd. \"Come on over to Windows; it's finally running on the kind of chip that suits your needs,\" Microsoft seems to be saying.\n\nAs for Qualcomm, the venerable chipmaker has a massive but brief window of opportunity here, as it has an exclusivity deal with Microsoft that makes it the sole provider of Arm-based processors for Windows PC, but only until the end of this year. So while its latest Snapdragon chipsets are ubiquitous in this first wave of Arm-based Copilot+ PCs, that probably won't remain the case in future waves, with the likes of Nvidia and AMD reportedly preparing to enter the fray. Qualcomm will definitely be hoping that the first wave catches the public's imagination, showing that its Snapdragon processors -- which have mostly been deployed in cheaper and less powerful laptops until now -- can shine on high-end devices.\n\nSo in short, there's a lot riding on this moment for a lot of companies. More news below.\n\nASML and TSMC's Taiwan safeguard. Top chipmaker TSMC and top chipmaking equipment maker ASML can reportedly disable their factory machines in Taiwan if China invades the island. According to Bloomberg, ASML and its biggest client \"can remotely force a shut-off which would act as a kill switch,\" thus rendering the chipmaking machines useless to Beijing. Taiwan, which China sees as a renegade province, churns out the majority of the world's advanced semiconductors.\n\nGoogle's public sector pitch. Last month, the U.S. government's Cyber Safety Review Board issued a scathing report on Microsoft's \"significant security failures and systematic weaknesses,\" after a (still ongoing) Russian attack on its corporate email system came to light. Yesterday, Google published a blog post arguing that the government should diversify its IT vendors -- strongly implying that Google should get more government business -- and generally slamming Microsoft's enterprise security approach.\n\nAI price war. China's Alibaba has ignited an AI price war by slashing the cost of using its Tongyi Qwen large language models. As Reuters reports, local rival Baidu immediately responded by saying enterprise users could tap into its Ernie Speed and Ernie Lite models for free. All this could further diminish profit margins for the companies, which have already been engaging in a cloud-computing price war.\n\n\"Dr Wright presents himself as an extremely clever person. However, in my judgment, he is not nearly as clever as he thinks he is. In both his written evidence and in days of oral evidence under cross-examination, I am entirely satisfied that Dr Wright lied to the Court extensively and repeatedly... All his lies and forged documents were in support of his biggest lie: his claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto.\"\n\n-- British High Court Judge James Mellor has released his full judgment in the case of Craig Wright, who is definitely not the inventor of Bitcoin, as he claimed to be. Bitcoin developers had sued Wright for his repeated efforts to claim intellectual property rights over the cryptocurrency.\n\nExclusive: OpenAI promised 20% of its computing power to combat the most dangerous kind of AI -- but never delivered, sources say, by Jeremy Kahn\n\nScarlett Johansson said she was forced to hire legal counsel to deal with Sam Altman and OpenAI, by Amanda Gerut\n\nChinese, Iranian, and Russian gangs are attacking U.S. drinking water and officials are alarmed, by the Associated Press\n\nMicrosoft's new AI-enabled laptops will have a 'photographic memory' of your virtual activity, by the Associated Press\n\nElon Musk, NPR, and a Signal smear campaign, by Jeff John Roberts\n\nTop-ranked analyst declares JPMorgan 'the Nvidia of banking' after it spends $17 billion on tech in a single year, by Amanda Gerut\n\nThreads oversight. Meta's Oversight Board, which makes content-moderation recommendations to the Facebook and Instagram parent, and occasionally overturns its decisions in specific cases, is now doing its thing with Meta's Insta-linked Threads. Its first Threads case involves the moderation of political content, specifically some arguably violent comments made in a post about Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. As TechCrunch notes, the move gives Threads a very different style of moderation oversight to that on rival platforms like X, Mastodon, and Bluesky.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType":

Cherney\n\nSEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft plans to announce several pieces of hardware and software related to consumer devices on Monday at an event at its Redmond, Washington, campus.\n\nThe Windows maker is expected to reveal a new version of its Surface Pro tablet and Surface Laptop that feature Qualcomm chips based on Arm Holdings' architecture.\n\nAfter Intel's processors dominated the personal computer market for decades, Qualcomm and other makers of lower-power Arm components have tried to compete in the Windows-PC market.\n\nThe Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chips include a so-called neural processing unit that is designed to accelerate AI-focused applications, such as Microsoft's Copilot software.\n\nMicrosoft's product event, a day before the start of its annual developer conference, is open to journalists and industry analysts who attend in person. It will not be live-streamed.\n\nMicrosoft aims to extend its early advantage in the race to produce AI tools that consumers are willing to pay for. Its partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI allowed it to jump ahead of Alphabet, as other Big Tech companies race to dominate the emerging field.\n\nLast week, OpenAI and Alphabet's Google showcased dueling AI technologies that can respond via voice in real time and be interrupted, both hallmarks of realistic voice conversations that AI voice assistants have found challenging. Google also announced it was rolling out several generative AI features to its lucrative search engine.\n\nThe PC industry has been under increasing pressure from Apple since the company launched its custom chips based on designs from Arm and ditched Intel's processors. The Apple-designed processors have given Mac computers superior battery life and speedier performance than rivals' chips that use more energy.\n\nMicrosoft tapped Qualcomm to lead the effort to move the Windows operating system to Arm's chip designs in 2016. Qualcomm has exclusivity on Microsoft Windows devices that expires this year. Other chip designers such as Nvidia have efforts under way to make their own Arm-based PC chips, Reuters has previously reported.\n\n(Reporting by Max A.

Microsoft's new \"Copilot+\" computer marketing category that highlights AI features is reminiscent of the \"Ultrabook\" category of thin-form Windows laptops that Intel promoted with PC manufacturers in 2011 to compete against Apple's MacBook Air.", "source": {"uri": "business-standard.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Standard"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@business-standard.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrabook", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ultrabook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet_PCs", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet PCs", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2024-05/03/thumb/fitandfill/600X300/1714703136-858.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

The conference's tagline \"How will AI shape your future?\" suggests a significant focus on AI-related upgrades.\n\nMicrosoft is predicted to unveil new AI facilities for Windows 11 and Office, including a feature named AI Explorer. This tool is designed to analyze all tasks on a user's PC and store that information in memory. There are also rumors of a possible tease of Windows 12, although its release isn't expected before 2025.\n\nMicrosoft's AI-powered assistant, Copilot, is set to receive substantial updates and deeper integration with both Office and Microsoft 365. These enhancements could include a wake-word facility for hands-free interaction, and the introduction of new Copilot flavors. The updates aim to improve user interaction with Microsoft's suite of products.\n\nIn addition to software enhancements, Microsoft is tipped to announce new hardware at the conference. The tech giant is likely to unveil new Surface tablets as well as laptops powered by Qualcomm's Arm-based Snapdragon X Elite chip.

For example, it can be used to open apps or edit photos. Copilot will also be visible in the Windows 11 taskbar.\n\nMicrosoft's latest suite of AI integrations comes as Big Tech companies continue jockeying for position in the generative AI race. Last week at Google I/O, the search giant made a host of announcements centered on integrating its AI chatbot Gemini into all things Google. This included everything from AI summarizations in Google search to the ambitious AI agent Project Astra.\n\nOpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, meanwhile, showed off GPT-4o, an update to its large language model that can handle more data. It demoed a voice-operated AI assistant that conversed in distinctively human ways, with vocal quirks, sarcasm and a flirty disposition. It reminded audiences so much of the movie Her, starring Scarlett Johansson as an AI chatbot, that OpenAI suspended the voice.\n\nThe stock market has been rewarding companies that are making the biggest impacts in the AI race. Nvidia saw its stock soar last year, briefly joining the trillion-dollar club, given that its tech powers many of the AI engines companies use. Meta, Google and Microsoft have also seen record jumps in their stock price as they invest billions of dollars in AI. Apple may or may note be creating its own commercial AI tech, but has been rumored to be shopping between Google and OpenAI to bring their tech to the iPhone. Whichever company wins over Apple will likely ink a multibillion-dollar deal.\n\nAlong with GPT-4o coming to Copilot, Microsoft also announced that the Surface Laptop 6 and Surface Pro will join a new line of Copilot Plus PCs. These PCs will have a new feature called Recall that'll allow you to ask questions about what you did a few days ago.

Can you open you inventory? Just press 'E' on your keyboard.'\n\nThe AI goes on to identify the player's inventory and concludes that they need to get some more wood or stone to craft a sword.\n\nAnother video, shared by the Microsoft Copilot Twitter account, shows the player attacked by zombies. When asked what they are by the player, the AI says:\n\n'Oh, no! It's a zombie. Run, you need to get away from it fast. Either sprint away, or quickly build a tower of blocks straight up to get out of its reach.'\n\nThe announcement doesn't say when the Copilot AI will be added to Minecraft, other than it's 'coming soon', but Microsoft AI CEO, Mustafa Suleyman, adds:\n\n'Microsoft changed computing history by inventing a new category: the Personal Computer or PC. Now we're re-inventing PCs for the AI era, taking us from personal computing to truly personal intelligence.\n\n'Today we're launching a new product category: Copilot+ PCs, the biggest update to Windows in its 40 year history, the fastest and most powerful AI ready PCs anywhere.'\n\nIf the AI works as well as in the demonstrations, when fully added to Minecraft it could make online game guides and YouTube tutorials redundant.\n\nAt the moment only Minecraft support has been added but if it works out it seems inevitable that it will be added to all games, especially given how keen Microsoft is on AI in general at the moment.\n\nEmail gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, follow us on Twitter, and sign-up to our newsletter.\n\nTo submit Inbox letters and Reader's Features more easily, without the need to send an email, just use our Submit Stuff page here.\n\nFor more stories like this, check our Gaming page.\n\nMORE : EA thinks AI can double its audience and make games quicker to develop\n\nMORE : YouTuber teaches AI to play Pok\u00e9mon Red and it's got really good", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kenneth_andersen@metro.co.uk", "name": "Kenneth Andersen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zombie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_guide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strategy guide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer keyboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuff_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stuff (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(British_newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metro (British newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok\u00e9mon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pok\u00e9mon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Puzzle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Puzzle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Word_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Word Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Educational", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SEI_205387956-275a.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C22px%2C463px%2C243px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

That means they do not have to rely on cloud data centers that currently power most AI applications, including OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nSome models can even support the training of AI models, a task that requires significant computing power and is typically performed on servers.\n\nPC makers are hoping such features will help draw in buyers as more people lean on generative AI for everything from sending emails to planning vacations.\n\nResearch firm Canalys estimates AI PC shipments will surpass 100 million in 2025, constituting 40% of all PCs shipped.\n\nWHAT TECHNOLOGY IS USED IN AI PCS?\n\nAI PCs come with specialized processors called neural processing units (NPUs) that handle the majority of on-device AI workloads.\n\nThese NPUs work in tandem with central processing units and graphics processors to manage complex tasks, deliver enhanced processing speeds and power applications such as AI assistants.\n\nWHAT ARE SOME OF THE AI PCS AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET?\n\nBrands including Dell, HP, Samsung Electronics , Lenovo, Asus and Acer have unveiled new computers under Microsoft's Copilot+ branding, which was announced on Monday.\n\nAmong these, Microsoft's refreshed Surface Laptop and Surface Pro tablet are some of the most affordable Copilot+ devices, starting at $999.\n\nLenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6, expected to start at $1,699, stands as the priciest option based on the pricing disclosed by some manufacturers.\n\nARE THERE ANY CONCERNS?\n\nA new flagship feature from Microsoft called \"recall\" has raised some privacy concerns. The Windows maker's Copilot+ PCs \"recall\" capability within the AI assistant allows it to search and retrieve information on any past activity on the computer.\n\nThe recall feature tracks every action performed on the laptop from voice chats to web browsing, and creates a detailed history stored on the device. The user can then search this repository and go through past actions.\n\nSome social media users have expressed fears that the feature could enable spying, while billionaire technologist Elon Musk compared it to \"Black Mirror,\" the Netflix series that explores the harmful effects of advanced technology.\n\nStill, several experts say that managing more AI-related tasks directly on the device offers greater privacy than options involving the transfer of user data through the cloud.\n\nResearch from Forrester showed AI PCs could help avoid the use of personal data to train AI systems, as well as copyright and patent violations, making them preferable for enterprise use.

For example, it could create and assign tasks to specific people and manage the agenda for a group meeting.\n\nThe Seattle-based group said business customers would also be able to create custom \"agents\" that can be configured to operate without waiting for human instructions. The company said the digital assistant can react to an incoming email by automatically suggesting or sending out responses, or instantly processing a customer order.\n\nThe enhanced capabilities form part of a slew of product updates revealed at Microsoft's annual developer conference which starts on Tuesday, with Copilot emerging as a flagship product that the company hopes would drive future profits.\n\nCopilot had been \"a game-changer\" in \"taking the drudgery out of work\", said Rajesh Jha, executive vice-president of experiences and devices at Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft took an early lead in developing generative AI products thanks to its $13bn investment in OpenAI, while vying with the likes of Google and Amazon to roll out competing services.\n\nTuesday's updates come days after Google unveiled a range of AI capabilities that are \"multimodal\", with digital agents that can answer questions across video, audio and text. That followed similar product launches and upgrades from companies including Meta and OpenAI.\n\nThe announcements are part of a push by tech groups including Google, Apple and OpenAI to create AI-powered smart assistants that can take the initiative in completing tasks for people.\n\nHardware companies also hope that consumers drawn by new AI features will be pushed to replace their old devices. Apple this month launched a new line of iPads powered by its next generation of M4 chips.\n\nOn Monday, Microsoft unveiled a new series of AI-enhanced PCs and tablets in a challenge to Apple's prominence. Certain devices made by companies including Dell, HP and Samsung would be equipped with Copilot capabilities that could, for example, be prompted to \"recall\" a user's past actions.\n\nAs part of Tuesday's announcements, Microsoft said customers using its AI services would now be able to use OpenAI's latest model, GPT-4o, as well as its family of small language models called Phi-3, which include a new multimodal model, Phi-3-vision.\n\nThe company also said a new ability to connect Copilot for Microsoft 365 to a broad range of data sources and applications -- such as legal data sets and customer records -- would allow the smart assistant to \"reason\" across a broader range of inputs.\n\nAsked how the more autonomous Copilot agents would be policed, Charles Lamanna, Microsoft's corporate vice-president of business applications and platforms, said users would be able to require that a human approve AI-suggested actions, such as allowing people to check an AI-generated email before it was sent. Users could also review in real time the steps an agent was going through to get to an outcome.\n\n\"We're not saying autopilot; we say co-pilot for a reason,\" said Jha. \"We don't think the co-pilot can be independent of human agency.\"\n\nThe upgraded Copilot tools will be available to business customers in preview later this year.\n\nInvestors are eager for evidence that the hugely expensive technology will drive healthy returns and, while Microsoft has said its new AI tools have helped drive sales, it has not disclosed Copilot user numbers.\n\nCopilot was \"central to [Microsoft's] AI narrative\" but \"the broader adoption curve remains shallower than many (including us) originally anticipated a quarter or two ago, specifically among office workers\", wrote analysts at Deutsche Bank in April.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score":

Today, as part of its Build 2024 conference, Microsoft stated that Copilot Studio will add new functions that will let developers create custom Copilots that can act like automated agents for their business:\n\nThese new capabilities will allow users to delegate authority to Copilot to automate long-running business processes, reason over actions and user inputs, leverage memory and knowledge for context, learn based on user feedback and exception requests and ask for help when it encounters situations that it doesn't know how to handle.\n\nThe agents feature for Copilot Studio is available as an Early Access program, but there's no word on when it will become generally available.\n\nDevelopers will also be able to use Copilot Studio to publish any Copilot extensions they have made to Copilot for Microsoft 365, along with direct publishing access to Microsoft Teams. It stated:\n\nCopilot extensions built with Copilot Studio will allow developers to customize copilots with instructions, knowledge from data sources and actions from plugins, Microsoft Power Automate flows and more. They will be simple to build and will enable extensibility and customization for specific domains or personas, such as expense reporting or employee onboarding, enabling a more relevant and personalized copilot experience.\n\nMicrosoft added that Copilot extensions will be published via the company's Partner Center so that users will be able to get them not only through the store in Copilot but also from other Microsoft 365 app stores that are available for Teams and Outlook apps, among others.\n\nAnother feature in the works for Microsoft's Copilot Studio is Copilot connections:\n\nCopilot connectors in Copilot Studio, in preview, will bring together Microsoft Graph and Power Platform connectors, AI skills in Microsoft Fabric (in private preview) and Microsoft Dataverse to make the process of grounding copilots in first- and third-party line-of-business data a wizard-based experience configured through Copilot Studio. This will enable developers to quickly incorporate their organizational knowledge into copilots, enable new actions and add real-time intelligent Q&A over productivity, operational and analytical data.\n\nCopilot Studios will also include pre-built templates so developers won't have to begin making a new customized Copilot service completely from scratch.

And while new Surface devices will be the company's hardware announcements, it's almost certain that AI will be the focus of Microsoft's keynote this year.\n\nThe event itself runs from May 21 to May 23, but several key announcements are set to happen today, May 20, at Microsoft's headquarters in Seattle. However, truth be told we've already got a very good idea of what to expect hardware-wise due to an earlier event Microsoft held for its enterprise customers. Namely, the Surface Pro 10 and the Surface Laptop 6.\n\nThe expected consumer versions of these devices will marry typical Surface design and build quality with Qualcomm's highly-touted Snapdragon X Elite chips. The processors will play a key role in powering the AI smarts we're sure to hear more about this week. Those smarts will come through Copilot in the form of extra capabilities and further integration with Microsoft products like Excel, Teams, Word and PowerPoint.\n\nSurface Pro 10: We've already seen the business-based version of Microsoft's flagship new Surface device, but we expect a couple of changes for the consumer model, this may include Intel Core \"Meteor Lake\" and Snapdragon X configurations, changes to the display and an improved 1,440p webcam -- so your Teams calls are extra crispy.\n\nSurface Laptop 6: Microsoft has also tipped the wink about the Surface Laptop 6. It'll be sold in two different sizes, just likes its predecessors: a 13.5-inch model and a 15-inch version. Design looks much the same as prior machines but we will get to confirm pricing and configurations for non-business folk today.\n\nWindows 11: Microsoft Build is, of course, a software-focused event so much of the talk will be on new features coming to Windows 11. These will surely be focused around AI but the real money is on whether we'll get our first real tease about what's in store for Windows 12.", "source": {"uri": "tomsguide.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tom's Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_parsons@tomsguide.com", "name": "Jeff Parsons", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Build", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Build"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surface Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surface Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Excel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft PowerPoint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel Core"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Webcam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P4CPwERbJqNuavC2jGvVaY-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "dateEnd": "2024-05-23", "textStart": 352, "textEnd": 368}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 425, "textEnd": 431}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Most of its integrations are provided under the overarching brand name of Copilot. There are Copilots in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, in industry solutions like finance and government, in Microsoft's security offerings, and even as part of Microsoft Visual Studio and GitHub development resources.\n\nFor as long as the concept of artificial intelligence has existed in the minds of forward-looking computer scientists, the idea of intelligent agents has also existed. The premise is that these agents could accomplish tasks that are otherwise tedious or annoying, and do so intelligently, thus freeing up the time of professionals to provide their unique value-added capabilities to their organizations.\n\nAlso: I went hands-on with Microsoft's Surface Pro and Laptop, and I'm ready to ditch my MacBook\n\nMicrosoft may be achieving some of those dreams here at Build 2024. At this event, Microsoft is announcing a variety of intelligent agent and AI-based automation tools to increase productivity on multiple levels. Some of what Microsoft is announcing is very preliminary and may not even enter preview for a while. As such, the details of what Microsoft is announcing are somewhat vague.\n\nThat said, here's what we know.\n\nLet's start off with a clarification. Team Copilot and Microsoft Teams are different entities. Team Copilot works with actual teams (lowercase \"t\") of people. It's used within Microsoft's Teams, Loop, Planner, and Microsoft 365 applications.\n\nMicrosoft says Team Copilot \"goes beyond a personal assistant,\" and can help groups at the team, department, or full company level. The intent is to help team management be more productive and collaborative.\n\nAlso: Every Copilot+ PC Microsoft just announced to take on Apple's M3 MacBooks\n\nTo this end, Team Copilot provides three primary services.\n\nThe first is Meeting Facilitator. This tool takes notes in a meeting and manages meeting agendas. It's not clear whether the note taking is just a form of transcription, or if the tool adds value by summarizing and organizing the meeting notes. At this stage, it's too early to know whether \"manages meeting agendas\" means coordinating meeting times, or acting as a communications intermediary to get agreements on actual meeting topics.\n\nNext up is Group Collaborator, which is designed to help everyone get more out of chats. Since Microsoft Teams has individual channels, it serves as something of a combination of Zoom and Slack. Group Collaborator adds to those capabilities, possibly by monitoring chat channels.\n\nFrom the way Microsoft describes it, it looks like it will spotlight the most important information, identify action items throughout the discussion, and find and help manage unresolved issues. We've so far only been given one sentence to work from, but it looks like the AI will have context awareness of the flow and structure of chat-based meetings.\n\nAlso: Yikes! Microsoft Copilot failed every single one of my coding tests\n\nThe last main component of Team Copilot is Project Manager. Microsoft says Team Copilot \"ensures every project runs smoothly.\" It creates and assigns tasks, tracks, deadlines, and notifies team members when input is needed. Of course, Microsoft has long had high-quality project management software, which also does task and deadline management. Reading between the lines, I'm guessing that the Team Copilot version does this work by processing Teams chats and other documents to provide some form of intelligently helpful guidance.\n\nThese capabilities will be in preview later this year.\n\nOne of the Copilot-related offerings that I find particularly interesting is the company's Copilot Studio. This is a no-code or low-code interface for building custom copilots based on your own business data.\n\nFor example, you might upload a set of PDFs that contain your HR policies into Copilot Studio, and then enable generative AI to answer questions based on those documents. This becomes particularly interesting when you can embed a custom copilot, based on these documents, right onto your company's website.\n\nCopilot Studio has a wide range of generative AI capabilities as well as a great many plugins that facilitate bringing data into and out of a given copilot. This would allow you to set up a copilot to track revenue, cross-index customer data, and deliver on a wide range of business information needs.\n\nAlso: These four new Copilot for Microsoft 365 features make prompt writing like a pro even easier\n\nAgents take the custom copilot idea to the next level. Now, instead of having those interactions driven solely by an individual, agents can do work dynamically. Microsoft says that agents can automate long-running business processes, reason over actions and user inputs, leverage memory to bring in context and learn based on user feedback.\n\nThe company describes one example, of an \"order taker\" copilot that manages end-to-end order fulfillment processes, from order taking, to processing orders, to managing and substituting out-of-stock items.\n\nOne idea that came to me was a copilot that drives the collections process. Accounts receivable operations have long had armies of collections agents making phone calls, and some simple automated processes which send dunning letters. But with an automated copilot, it could be possible to have full conversations with the financed party, listen to issues raised, conduct negotiations, offer compromises, and more. Conversations could be initiated via an outgoing text message, and then conducted entirely over text interaction.\n\nThis could reduce the staffing requirements considerably, which could be a win for lenders. Of course, any time we replace jobs with machines, there are some serious societal concerns. Even so, it's up to each company to balance cost reduction with quality of service. An AI agent might make accessing support easier for borrowers, and allow the company using the AI to allocate its more experienced personnel to problems more worthy of their attention.\n\nThe ability to add agents in Copilot Studio is now in early access. The company expects a public preview to be available later in the year.\n\nMicrosoft is also announcing the ability to add your own extensions to Copilot for your own data and operations. These allow you to build customizations and data access tools to suit your business requirements. Extensions can be built in Copilot Studio or using the Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio.\n\nAdditionally, the company is introducing Copilot connectors, which are ready-to-use components to get you started building extensions.\n\nStay tuned to ZDNET for the latest up-to-the-minute coverage of Build 2024, including even more coverage of the Redmond-based company's announcements.", "source": {"uri": "zdnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ZDNet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_officer_(aviation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First officer (aviation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Teams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Teams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intelligent agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MacBook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Visual Studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_365", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft 365"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surface Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Excel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GitHub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerPoint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft PowerPoint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slack_(software)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slack (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note-taking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Note-taking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Project management software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading,_Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reading, Berkshire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PDF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human resources"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Spreadsheets", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Spreadsheets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/d16601d51655d74d820de6a9268f99e27df00d10/2024/05/21/a80a9ff0-a802-4ac9-bcbd-697c3d380984/img-3179.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Image Credit: AFP\n\nMicrosoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella is setting his sights on a new era of computing, one fueled by specialised artificial intelligence chips and enhanced performance, in a bid to reignite the age-old rivalry between Windows PCs and Apple Inc.'s Mac.\n\nAcknowledging Apple's remarkable achievements, Nadella expressed his intention to introduce robust competition to the Windows versus Mac landscape. Microsoft's latest move involves the introduction of a new category of AI-focused PCs dubbed Copilot+ PC.\n\nThese machines, developed under the Microsoft Surface line and by other manufacturers, boast dedicated AI processing chips, promising significantly enhanced power and speed.\n\nIn fact, Microsoft claims these new devices will outpace Apple's MacBook Air M3 by a staggering 58 per cent. Priced starting at $1,000, these cutting-edge PCs are set to hit the market on June 18.\n\nAlthough Apple has been playing catch-up with its Big Tech counterparts when it comes to AI, the company is gearing up to unveil an ambitious strategy at its upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference. It already gave users a hint of things to come with the launch of M4 SoC at the launch of the 2024 iPad series.\n\nReports suggest that Apple plans to integrate high-end chips, similar to those designed for the Mac, into cloud-computing servers tailored for processing advanced AI tasks. Simultaneously, simpler AI features will be processed directly on iPhones, iPads, and Macs, with a focus on enhancing user experience by offering personalised suggestions and streamlined interactions.\n\nMicrosoft's strategic advantage in the field of generative AI services stems from its partnership with leading AI startup OpenAI.\n\nHowever, this partnership has drawn regulatory scrutiny, with officials in the US, Europe, and the UK closely examining Microsoft's AI investments, along with those of its competitors. Nadella, however, maintains that Microsoft's collaborations are fostering healthy competition in the nascent AI sector, rather than stifling it.\n\nIn Nadella's view, the current landscape is characterised by formidable competition among both industry giants and smaller players alike.\n\nHe emphasises that the focus should not be on individual companies acquiring or dominating the market but rather on fostering an environment of healthy competition that drives innovation and benefits consumers.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Surface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_(computer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mac (computer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "User experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/05/Microsoft-CEO-Satya-Nadella-believes-new-CoPilot-PCs-will-take-down-Apples-Macs-2024-05-f572a2390d3402a0423c0f605249193a-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 994, "textEnd": 1001}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Microsoft signals a new laptop era with CoPilot+ PCs", "body": "Intel, which makes the top-selling chips that power PCs, has been talking about \"AI PCs\" constantly since 2023. And now Microsoft has introduced the term of the CoPilot+ PCs, its own version of the AI PC.\n\nIs it all marketing? Is there really anything new to these AI PCs? And should you be considering an upgrade just because we're apparently in the era of AI laptops and desktops? Here's what you need to know.\n\nWhat is an AI PC?\n\nThe idea of the AI PC is a convenient marketing tool for companies that would love you to upgrade your hardware. But there is also a somewhat firm backing behind the concept.\n\nAI PCs have a processor with something called an NPU, a neural processing unit. This sounds more sci-fi than it actually is. It's a chipset optimised specifically for the kind of jobs AI requires.\n\nThe same work can typically be done by your regular old laptop CPU processor, but it may be slower and consume more power doing so. This is why the tech is so important in laptop PCs, as opposed to desktops. Efficiency matters even more when you're running off a battery.\n\nIf you dig a little deeper into this stuff, you'll see Intel and Qualcomm (who make the chips) and Microsoft (which touts AI software) cite the need for \"40 TOPS\" of NPU power.\n\nTOPS stands for \"trillions of operations per second\". But the only real important bit here is this level of power has been pegged as what a PC needs to run an AI assistant in real time on the laptop/desktop without relying on doing the processing work in the cloud (over the internet).\n\nIs this still a somewhat arbitrary standard? Yes.\n\nAI-boosting NPU hardware has been in phones since 2017. Apple introduced it in its iPhone X with A11 Bionic chipset in 2017. Huawei started the ball rolling among Android phones in 2017, too, with its Kirin 970 and the Huawei P20 Pro.\n\nApple laptops have had NPUs since 2020's M1 MacBooks. This tech isn't as new as you might assume. However, Windows 11 maker Microsoft chose May 2024 as the time to draw a line in the sand and announce its own new era of NPU power in PCs.\n\nWindows 11 Recall is the most alarming of these new AI features. It can monitor everything you do on your PC, remember it, and then use that knowledge to inform answers further down the line when you ask it for help, or to find something on your PC.\n\nIt's like a PA but, well, potentially way more creepy. How much of this AI stuff will you lose without a full \"AI PC\"? We're not sure just yet.\n\nWhich laptops count as AI PCs?\n\nThe latest wave of AI PCs are ones labelled CoPilot+ laptops. Here are some of the models announced so far:\n\nAll of these laptops have either the Qualcomm Snapdragon X or Snapdragon X Elite processor. Qualcomm chips are usually more associated with phones than laptops, even though it has produced the 'brains' of laptops for years.\n\nHowever, according to early testing by XDA Developers, these are even more powerful than recent top-spec laptop processors from Intel in almost all benchmarks.\n\nThinking about buying a new laptop soon? You might want to wait for these CoPilot+ PCs to appear in June, even if the daily encroachment of AI makes you more wary than excited.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_williams@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Andrew Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chipset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_X", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone X"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple M1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei_P20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Huawei P20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XDA_Developers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "XDA Developers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HiSilicon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HiSilicon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MacBook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Huawei"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Systems", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet_PCs", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet PCs", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/f099b62248616d903961c3e68c3d6cf7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

That means they do not have to rely on cloud data centers that currently power most AI applications, including OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nSome models can even support the training of AI models, a task that requires significant computing power and is typically performed on servers.\n\nPC makers are hoping such features will help draw in buyers as more people lean on generative AI for everything from sending emails to planning vacations.\n\nResearch firm Canalys estimates AI PC shipments will surpass 100 million in 2025, constituting 40% of all PCs shipped.\n\nWHAT TECHNOLOGY IS USED IN AI PCS?\n\nAI PCs come with specialized processors called neural processing units (NPUs) that handle the majority of on-device AI workloads.\n\nThese NPUs work in tandem with central processing units and graphics processors to manage complex tasks, deliver enhanced processing speeds and power applications such as AI assistants.\n\nWHAT ARE SOME OF THE AI PCS AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET?\n\nBrands including Dell, HP, Samsung Electronics, Lenovo, Asus and Acer have unveiled new computers under Microsoft's Copilot+ branding, which was announced on Monday.\n\nAmong these, Microsoft's refreshed Surface Laptop and Surface Pro tablet are some of the most affordable Copilot+ devices, starting at $999.\n\nLenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6, expected to start at $1,699, stands as the priciest option based on the pricing disclosed by some manufacturers.\n\nARE THERE ANY CONCERNS?\n\nA new flagship feature from Microsoft called \"recall\" has raised some privacy concerns. The Windows maker's Copilot+ PCs \"recall\" capability within the AI assistant allows it to search and retrieve information on any past activity on the computer.\n\nThe recall feature tracks every action performed on the laptop from voice chats to web browsing, and creates a detailed history stored on the device. The user can then search this repository and go through past actions.\n\nSome social media users have expressed fears that the feature could enable spying, while billionaire technologist Elon Musk compared it to \"Black Mirror,\" the Netflix series that explores the harmful effects of advanced technology.\n\nStill, several experts say that managing more AI-related tasks directly on the device offers greater privacy than options involving the transfer of user data through the cloud.\n\nResearch from Forrester showed AI PCs could help avoid the use of personal data to train AI systems, as well as copyright and patent violations, making them preferable for enterprise use.\n\n(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa and Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru;

For a little more, you can go with the QHD+ touchscreen which also reaches 500 nits and 120Hz. Lastly, there's the OLED 3K touchscreen, which trades off crisper visuals and more vibrant coloring for a lower 400 nits of brightness and only a peak refresh rate of 60Hz.\n\nTo meet your connectivity needs, this new XPS 13 revision uses Qualcomm FastConnect 7800 Wi-Fi as well as Bluetooth 5.4, so you can connect to various accessories and networks with ease. Additionally, there are two 40Gbps w/PD DP 2.1 USB-C ports, which will allow you to charge up with the included USB-C power adapter as well as transmit video information to connected devices. As with all modern XPS laptops, this one does not feature any built-in USB-A ports.\n\nIn order to be considered an AI PC by Microsoft's standards, a laptop must feature a Copilot key, and that's exactly what the new XPS 13 does. As is typical, this key is located to the right of the Alt button, next to the space bar. Pressing it quickly brings up Microsoft's AI assistant so you can ask questions or give prompts and then quickly get generated answers or imagery via DALL-E. Of course, Microsoft also announced Copilot+ today, so if you're interested in that the button will be even more appealing. Just to clarify, this laptop is capable of working with Copilot+ thanks to the Snapdragon X Elite NPU.\n\nWe don't currently know how long the 55Wh battery lasts for, however, the Dell XPS 13 line usually offers a respectable battery life. As always, the length of time the laptop lasts for will depend on certain configuration options, especially your choice of display.\n\nAs with many smaller laptops, the XPS 13 (9345) is relatively compact and lightweight. It only measures in at 11.62 x 7.84 x 0.58+ inches and has a starting weight of 2.6 pounds, but can get a little heavier and thicker depending on the components chosen for it.\n\nWe're going to be seeing a whole lot of Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite AI PC laptops announced this week, thanks to a mixture of embargo lifts and the Microsoft event going on today. Since it does tote a Snapdragon X Elite CPU, that means that this XPS 13 revision features an ARM-based chip for Windows (you can learn more at our Windows on ARM FAQ). ARM SoCs have been around for a long time now as can be found in the Apple MacBook with its \"M\"-Series chips or Microsoft Surface laptops with their SQ-Series chips. However, a new ARM revolution led with the powerful Snapdragon X Elite is making it so many new ARM-based laptops are coming to the market this year.\n\nNow, there was a time when ARM-based laptops were considered limited and couldn't run all programs, but that is no longer the case. In fact, it doesn't matter if your computer runs on ARM, all of your apps will work on Windows 11. So you can confidently purchase one of these new ARM-based AI PCs.\n\nOf the devices announced, the Dell XPS 13 (9345) is a rather impressive option for anyone looking to get a smaller AI PC laptop. While not the most lightweight laptop on the market, the Dell XPS 13 (9345) is a relatively slim shape that is easy to tote around. Thanks to its NPU-toting CPU, this laptop should be more than capable of handling local AI tasks faster (including various Copilot+ features) than non-AI PC laptops.\n\nThere's been a lot of talk about AI PCs and Copilot+ today, but what exactly are these things? How does Copilot+ differ from the original Copilot service?\n\nLet's start with AI PCs. You can read more in our AI PC guide, but the gist is that these types of laptops and computers feature an AI-boosting NPU as part of the CPU. You can learn more at our NPU guide, but the idea is that the NPU takes certain AI-specific tasks off of the CPU load and GPU load in order to free up those processors. This in turn allows the system to run more efficiently so the CPU and GPU can focus on bigger tasks while the NPU takes care of smaller tasks. The typical result for this setup is an extreme increase in performance when running AI tasks locally. Traditionally, a lot of heftier AI applications like text and image generation have been done on the cloud via a distant server, but having an AI PC means you can conduct similar tasks on your own PC. This also means AI tasks are more secure and private.\n\nNow that that's been cleared up, let's discuss Copilot+. According to Microsoft, this is an umbrella term for various next-gen AI features that will be shipped with all Copilot-branded PCs this year. In case you need a refresher, the original Copilot is an AI assistant that can answer questions or respond to text prompts by doing the heavy lifting on a distant server and giving you answers via the cloud.\n\nMeanwhile, Copilot+ stands apart by offering improved functionality and additional experiences, but generated locally on your own device. As such, in order to use Copilot+, your computer needs to have an NPU capable of at least 45 TOPS of power or higher. So what new AI features are we talking about? This includes enhanced image and text generation, advanced Windows Studio Effects, Auto Super Resolution, Live Caption translations, and the ability to bring up (Recall) things you've previously seen. The first Copilot+ PCs start shipping this June.", "source": {"uri": "windowscentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Windows Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_spear@windowscentral.com", "name": "Rebecca Spear", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ARM architecture family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_XPS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dell XPS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "USB-C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchscreen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Hexagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Hexagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adreno", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adreno"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_display_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics display resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solid-state drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "1080p"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qhLsftB55YAPiCzmNhcTm8-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

It's the first Surface Laptop ever to feature an updated design, with thinner display bezels, a haptic touchpad, and other quality of life improvements.\n\nThe new Copilot+ PCs initiative is the next stage of the \"AI PC\" that Microsoft has been pushing for a number of months. Copilot+ PCs are capable of several next-gen AI experiences that are exclusive to these PCs, including a new Windows Recall feature that can remember everything you see and do on your PC, real-time language translations, and advanced Windows Studio Effects. You can learn more about these new AI experiences in our in-depth write-up.\n\nThe new Surface Laptop is the first in its line to ship with Arm chips on the inside. Specifically, it's available with Qualcomm's new Snapdragon X Plus and X Elite system on a chip, which deliver incredible performance and true all day battery life. In fact, this laptop is more powerful than the Surface Laptop 6 for business, which ships with Intel's latest Core Ultra processors.\n\nWe're also finally getting a refreshed design, something the Surface Laptop has been in dire need of for about three generations now. This new generation has thinner bezels with rounded display corners, as well as an updated keyboard deck with a larger haptic touchpad, built by Sensel. The laptop also has a revised selection of ports that includes one USB-A, two USB-C, an audio jack, and Surface Connect.\n\nThe device is still available in two sizes, those being 13- and 15-inch screen sizes. However, the 13-inch model has a slightly larger display compared to the Surface Laptop 5, going from a 13.5-inch panel to 13.8-inches, made possible thanks to that thinning of the bezels. The 15-inch model remains at 15-inches.\n\nMicrosoft says the new Surface Laptop will be available for pre-order today, and is expected to start shipping sometime next month. The device will ship with Windows 11 version 24H2 preloaded, but many of the Copilot+ AI features won't be available until later this year when 24H2 begins rolling out more broadly.", "source": {"uri": "windowscentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Windows Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zac_bowden@windowscentral.com", "name": "Zac Bowden", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surface Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haptic technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchpad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Display device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USB-C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Surface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phone connector (audio)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer keyboard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c2hAyUMq35UjDNqo6QdeZn-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Here's What He Said", "body": "\"Apple's done a fantastic job,\" Nadella stated. \"We now want to bring real competition back to the Windows versus Mac.\" ( Image Source :Getty )\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella has just reignited the age-old Windows vs Mac war, as part of the Redmond giant's announcement of a new generation of computers featuring specialised artificial intelligence (AI) chips and enhanced performance capabilities. During an interview with Bloomberg Television on Monday, Nadella acknowledged Apple's success but emphasised Microsoft's intention to re-establish a strong rivalry. \"Apple's done a fantastic job,\" Nadella stated. \"We now want to bring real competition back to the Windows versus Mac.\"\n\nThe tech giant has introduced a new class of AI-centric PCs, branded as Copilot+PC. According to Microsoft, these devices will incorporate a dedicated AI processing chip, boosting their performance significantly.\n\nMachines from Microsoft's Surface lineup, along with models from other manufacturers, are expected to be 58 per cent faster than Apple's high-end MacBook Air M3. Priced starting at $999, these new computers are slated to be available from June 18.\n\nALSO READ: Elon Musk Said He'd 'Definitely' Turn This Windows PC Feature Off. Here's What Got Him Worried\n\nNadella defended the competitive landscape, asserting that the current environment is vibrant with both large and small players. \"Today there is a formidable amount of competition, right?\" he commented.\n\n\"Whether it is between the big players or the small players. So I don't think that this is about any one company acquiring or not acquiring, but it's about competition.\"\n\nMicrosoft's aggressive push into AI is bolstered by its partnership with OpenAI, a leading AI research organisation. This alliance aims to position Microsoft at the forefront of generative AI services. However, the collaboration has attracted the attention of regulatory bodies in the US, Europe, and the UK, who are scrutinising Microsoft's and its competitors' AI investments to assess their impact on market competition and the potential need for regulatory measures akin to those applied to mergers.\n\nALSO READ: Microsoft AI Copilot's 'Windows Recall' Can Now Track All User Activities On PC.

Despite trailing some of its tech competitors in AI, Apple plans to integrate advanced AI capabilities into its devices. The company is reportedly designing high-performance chips for cloud computing servers to handle sophisticated AI tasks, while simpler AI functions will be managed directly on iPhones, iPads, and Macs.\n\nApple's focus will be on enhancing user convenience through features that provide personalised suggestions and experiences.\n\nAs both Microsoft and Apple advance their AI initiatives, the battle for supremacy in the personal computing market is poised to intensify, promising significant innovations and benefits for consumers.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Television", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Surface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_(computer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mac (computer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/05/21/379711a07028b1100b3c962b57fe72e71716269818424402_original.jpg?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 1136, "textEnd": 1143}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Microsoft's latest Copilot+ PC announcement featured such AI solutions from the start to the end of the presentation, and I got a chance to test them all out.\n\nAlso: Every Copilot+ PC Microsoft just announced to take on Apple's M3 MacBooks\n\nThe new AI features, including Recall, Cocreator in Paint, Live captions with live translation, Restyle in Photos, and Windows Studio Effects, are only available on Copilot+ PCs, which include the new Surface Laptop and Surface Pro, as well as PCs from partners such as Lenovo, HP, and Dell.\n\nMy thoughts on the latest AI tools, their performance and usability, and more below.\n\nHow often have you exited out of a tab, application, or project that you later wanted to access but couldn't find? Microsoft yesterday unveiled a new \"Recall\" feature for Copilot+ PCs that solves that exact issue, while taking things a step further.\n\nWith Recall, users can locate just about anything they've ever interacted with on their PC -- including files, images, text, and more -- simply by typing in what they want to locate and having their PC populate possible matches for them. You can also scroll back through possible timelines to see what and where you were browsing in the past.\n\nAlso: 3 AI features coming to Copilot+ PCs that I wish were on my MacBook\n\nThe feature works by storing a semantic index of your activity locally on your PC. If you are like me, your first thoughts were, \"Do I want everything stored?\" Microsoft addresses that concern by allowing users to personalize their snapshots, delete specified information, pause any tracking, and filter websites and apps that they don't want to be saved.\n\nOne example that a Microsoft member shared with me was when he asked his colleague if they were familiar with another colleague. To help show him what the other colleague looked like, he used the Recall feature to access a Zoom call he had with the individual.\n\nAs someone who grew up in a Spanish-speaking household, I am familiar with language barriers and how much they can hinder everyday communication. Naturally, the AI-supported Live captions with live translation feature stood out to me the most.\n\nAs the lengthy name implies, the feature can generate captions for all audio that passes through your PC in over 40 languages into English subtitles, all in real time. For the demo, I spoke into the Surface Laptop's microphone and was pleasantly surprised with how accurate and speedy the English-to-Spanish translation was.\n\nAlso: Microsoft's Surface Pro and Laptop are the ultimate 'AI PCs', and I'm worried for Apple\n\nWhen I spoke Spanish instead, the captions automatically shifted from one language to the other nearly instantaneously with minimal lag. Most importantly, the translations were still accurate, and better than the standard Google Translate. Not having to switch between languages manually is a game-changer because, in real-world conversations, you don't have the time or foresight to predict when the other person will start speaking.\n\nWhen using it, you can choose whether the computer's microphone or the internal audio from a video, song, or meeting should be used. This makes the feature suitable for various applications, such as translating all-hands meetings, conversations with customer service representatives, and more.\n\nWill Cocreator win awards for being the most useful AI feature ever? Probably not. Was it tons of fun to test? Definitely. With Cocreator, users can use an AI canvas to quickly transform their sketches into more polished art. The Creativity bar lets you choose how much of the original sketch you'd like to keep and how much more you'd like to be AI-generated.\n\nAlso: I went hands-on with Microsoft's Surface Pro and Laptop, and I'm ready to ditch my MacBook\n\nFor example, in the demo, I drew a terrible sketch of a puppy, as seen in the image above. When I turned Creativity up to 100, Cocreator generated a much cuter rendition of the dog, keeping some basic features such as big beady eyes, floppy ears, and even my color scheme.\n\nThis feature appeals to me more than the traditional AI image generators since the mock-up process feels more genuine and personal. Additionally, some creatives, such as marketers or interior designers, can benefit from adding a tool like this to their workflow -- when an idea comes to mind and they just don't have the time to map it all out.\n\nAlmost equally as fun is Restyle in Photos. With this feature, users can modify their photos with generative AI, changing elements such as the background or even the full picture to match a specific style or theme.\n\nAlso: What is Veo? Meet Google's next-gen AI video creator\n\nAs seen in my demo, I was able to completely change the background of a photo of the couple by typing in a descriptive text prompt with what I wanted to see instead. Like Cocreator, users can set a Creativity level to adjust how much of the image is generated with AI.\n\nWhile Restyle in Photos may not be a feature I would necessarily use every day, I can see it being useful for creating lock screens, greeting cards, seasonal messages, and more.\n\nCopilot+ PCs also have Image Creator in Photos, which, like other image generators, transforms a user text prompt into an image. However, the impressive part here is that the tool runs on-device instead of in the cloud like DALL-E. As a result, generated images come out faster, and the whole process happens locally.\n\nAlso: The best AI image generators of 2024: Tested and reviewed\n\nIn my demo, I prompted Image Creator in Photos to generate 50 images, and I was shocked by how quickly it completed the task. As seen in the image above, Image Creator relied entirely on Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite NPU to generate the images, lessening the power required from the laptop's GPU and CPU.\n\nLastly, Windows Studio Effects has been enhanced to deliver improved video calls, with features such as Portrait Light that enhances how you or your background are illuminated, an eye contact teleprompter, which helps you read your screen while keeping contact, and, my favorite, creative filters.\n\nAlso: How to use Image Creator from Microsoft Designer (formerly Bing Image Creator)\n\nWhile creative filters are perhaps the least practical addition to Windows Studio Effects, it was really fun to see myself being transformed into an animated version with impressive detail, as seen in the image above. Work and video calls can be boring, so why not have some fun?\n\nFor more serious conversations, voice focus, a feature that uses AI to detect and cancel noises around you, and portrait blur, which blurs your background in calls, will be of great use.", "source": {"uri": "zdnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ZDNet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MacBook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Surface Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Surface Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semantics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Usability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Translate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google Translate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DALL-E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop_Customization", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop Customization", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/939dc24d3bb670c6964fa5e09433ca267e060f9f/2024/05/21/b1bee5af-b0fe-4e38-9f73-f00feb0e6233/img-3285.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Should You Upgrade Now?", "body": "It's safe to assume that Microsoft's big bet on OpenAI has paid off, with the company integrating Copilot into every possible service. However, until now, the integration of these AI systems has been surface-level, as they require an internet connection to process data. To address this issue, Microsoft has just announced a new branding called \"Copilot Plus PCs,\" which aims to take AI integration to the next level. Here is everything you need to know about it.\n\nSimilar to smartphones, laptops with the \"Copilot Plus PCs\" branding denote devices with built-in artificial intelligence, thanks to specialized AI hardware. Unfortunately, this also means that current laptops will not be able to support this standard as they lack the necessary neural hardware.\n\nAdditionally, since running AI models is a resource-intensive task, Microsoft has set specific requirements to ensure a smooth experience. These requirements include a minimum of 256GB of SSD storage and 16GB of RAM. Moreover, ARM laptops must provide at least 15 hours of battery life.\n\nNow that we have the spec requirements out of the way, you might wonder what the advantages of this integration are. Firstly, built-in AI systems will reduce reliance on cloud-based processing, enhancing privacy for documents and significantly reducing processing time. Moreover, the AI will enable users to ask questions about the PC in natural language and receive answers, thus helping the less tech-savvy users.\n\nPerhaps the biggest advantage of this integration is the \"Recall\" feature. According to Microsoft, this feature will allow the AI to analyze your usage patterns and create a \"photographic memory\" of all the tasks you perform daily. The AI would then optimize the system to make these everyday tasks more fluid and less time-consuming. Additionally, if you're learning a new skill, such as video editing, the feature will provide helpful insights based on the menus and content being displayed.\n\nAlthough we currently cannot test the performance gains, Microsoft claims that these laptops would be more than 50% faster than the latest M3 MacBook Air while maintaining solid all-day battery life. However, it is important to note that company hasn't specified if all laptops with the \"Copilot Plus PCs\" branding would have this performance benefit or only ARM laptops.\n\nFurthermore, the company will use 40 AI models to power these features, along with Copilot. Additionally, this integration will first debut with ARM chips as part of Microsoft's push toward greater adoption. However, Intel and AMD chips will receive these features in the future as well.\n\nConsidering the first ARM laptops with the branding will start shipping on June 18th, you might be tempted to consider them. However, keep in mind that ARM support on Windows is still lackluster, meaning many software applications will require a translation layer to work, which can significantly impact performance. Therefore, if you urgently need to upgrade your laptop, we advise against considering the ARM alternatives, as you will pay the \"early adopters tax.\"", "source": {"uri": "fossbytes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fossbytes"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hisan_kidwai@fossbytes.com", "name": "Hisan Kidwai", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ARM architecture family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solid-state drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Application software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Systems", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://fossbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/copilot-plus-pc-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 2699, "textEnd": 2708}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

The machines from Microsoft's Surface line and manufacturing partners will offer more power and will be 58% faster than Apple's top-of-the-line Macbook Air M3, the company said.\n\nMicrosoft also said OpenAI's GPT-4o, an updated version of its GPT-4 that's better at handling text, audio and images in real-time, will soon come to the company's Copilot AI assistant. Microsoft demonstrated a feature called Recall that's designed to help users find a buried browser tab, file, email or chat, based on conversational language prompts.

This mode would enable users to leverage upscaling in a range of games, specifically selected by Microsoft, to look and run great however, it looks like the feature is currently only limited to Copilot+ PCs such as the ones based on Snapdragon X CPUs.\n\nIn its Copilot+ PC features FAQ, Microsoft explains that Automatic Super Resolution, or Auto SR in short will enable higher frame rates in existing games in real-time while also enhancing the visual detail displayed on your screen. The company states that the feature will offer a balance that will exceed what your PC hardware can achieve on ts own. In simple terms, it's an upscaling tech that we have seen from the likes of NVIDIA (DLSS), AMD (FSR), and Intel (XeSS) already though it remains to be seen if the quality will be able to match those technologies.\n\nAuto super resolution (Auto SR) seamlessly integrates with Windows to automatically enhance the frame rates of existing games in real-time while also providing detailed visuals on screen, offering a balance that exceeds what your PC hardware can achieve on its own. At initial launch, this feature will be exclusive to Copilot+ PCs equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon\u00ae X Elite processor and a curated set of games.\n\nvia Microsoft\n\nBased on previous information, we have learned that Microsoft Automatic Super Resolution tech is going to leverage AI processing to achieve higher frames and better fidelity. The AI prowess will be coming directly from the NPU & GPU, which when combined, offer over 45+ TOPS on these AI PCs.\n\nCurrently, the only Copilot+ certified PCs are based on Qualcomm's Snapdragon X hardware and will be available by next month on retail shelves. Intel and AMD are also working on their next-gen Copilot+ platforms starting with Lunar Lake and Strix which are expected to offer over 100 TOPS of AI processing power. Microsoft also confirmed yesterday that Copilot+ will be expanded with these new PCs with new features and support for NVIDIA GeForce RTX and AMD Radeon RX GPUs is also confirmed.\n\nSo based on that, we can expect PCs that meet the 40-45+ AI TOPS requirement will be labeled as Copilot+ compliant and will also be able to use the Automatic Super Resolution (Auto SR) feature. Microsoft also states that not all games will be able to leverage Auto SR and that a curated set of games will be able to use it. Microsoft Studios and Microsoft partnered games are likely to be the first to use the tech along with a list of older titles as World of Warcraft was mentioned in the last demo.\n\nThe Microsoft Automatic Super Resolution (Auto SR) technology should not be confused with DirectSR which is meant to ease the process of integration of super-resolution tech for devs & supports NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS. There are also several handy mods and tools, allow gamers to utilize super-resolution upscaling in a range of existing titles through direct or indirect injection.", "source": {"uri": "wccftech.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wccftech"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hassan_mujtaba@wccftech.com", "name": "Hassan Mujtaba", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scaling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Image scaling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning_super_sampling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deep learning super sampling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPUOpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GPUOpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Game_Studios", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Game Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_RTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia RTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GeForce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World of Warcraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radeon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radeon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet_PCs", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet PCs", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Microsoft-Automatic-Super-Resolution-Copilot-PCs.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

Deep within the documentation accompanying the build release, the company says:\n\nOver the last few months, we've been trying out different experiences for Copilot in Windows (Preview) with Windows Insiders across the Canary, Dev, and Beta Channels. Some of these experiences include the ability for Copilot in Windows to act like a normal application window and the taskbar icon animating to indicate that Copilot can help when you copy text or images. We have decided to pause the rollouts of these experiences to further refine them based on user feedback. Copilot in Windows will continue to work as expected while we continue to evolve new ideas with Windows Insiders.\n\nThe precise reasoning behind this decision is not clear. It could be that Microsoft has noticed a bit of a backlash against it focusing so much time and attention on Copilot and has decided to slow things down a bit.

But as a platform maker, Microsoft also creates copilots for developers, like GitHub Copilot, and it provides tools so that these developers can create their own copilots and extend the capabilities of existing copilots.\n\nAnd Microsoft made several announcements today that address those latter needs. Plus, some related Power Platform updates.\n\nThe biggest news in this space is that Microsoft is unifying all its Microsoft Copilot extensibility methods, including plugins and connectors, into a single, unified construct called Copilot extensions. Developers can create Copilot extensions using Copilot Studio or the Microsoft Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code. And Microsoft will use these extensions to enhance Microsoft Copilot across its many endpoints -- the web, Windows, Microsoft 365, and so on -- by enabling new actions and custom GPTs with grounded knowledge bases.\n\nAs for Copilot Studio, Microsoft's graphical copilot creation tool is gaining a new set of capabilities, now in early access, that help developers create copilots that act like agents, orchestrate business processes, integrate line of business (LOB) data, and publish Copilot extensions. Copilot extensions will be published through Partner Center to app stores in Microsoft Copilot, Microsoft Teams, and Microsoft Outlook.\n\nTo better align Copilot Studio and the Power Platform, Microsoft is bringing Copilot connectors to Copilot Studio in preview that can ground copilots using Microsoft Graph and Power Platform connectors, AI skills in Microsoft Fabric (in private preview), and Microsoft Dataverse.\n\nMicrosoft is also updating Power Automate with new capabilities, including an AI flows feature that uses generative AI to autonomously build flows. The user just describes what they wish to achieve using natural language, and the AI determines which steps and actions are required to achieve that outcome. Power Automate is also getting a generative AI-based AI recorder that lets users describe the actions rather than going through the exact keyboard and mouse actions. A similar tool will help Power Automate users on the desktop create rules-based flows more easily using natural language.\n\nRelated to this, Microsoft Power Apps is getting native Git integration so that developers can sync their Power Apps environment and Git repositories.\n\n\"By connecting the two, development teams will be able to see and track all changes, quickly and seamlessly integrate their development processes, quality tools and best practices directly into their Power Apps environment and reduce the time it takes to build an app,\" Microsoft explains. \"Unlike previous application lifecycle management (ALM) tools that were complex to set up and required makers to jump between toolsets, Git integration and pipelines in Power Platform will be available for all makers, will be on by default, and will drive consistency of ALM processes and governance across projects.\"\n\nFinally, GitHub Copilot is gaining Azure Migrate skills to help developers get answers and recommendations for Azure Migrate.", "source": {"uri": "thurrott.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Thurrott.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_thurrott@thurrott.com", "name": "Paul Thurrott", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Teams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Teams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensibility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extensibility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_user", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "End user"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plug-in (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Power_Automate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Power Automate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub_Copilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GitHub Copilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Power_Platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Power Platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_365", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft 365"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Visual Studio Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "App store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knowledge base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Outlook", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Outlook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Git"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_lifecycle_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Application lifecycle management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_controller", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Game controller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Software", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://thurrott-assets.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/web/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/copilot-studio.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

The tech giant is expected to reveal updated versions of its Surface Pro tablet and Surface Laptop, featuring Qualcomm chips based on Arm Holdings' architecture. This marks a significant shift as Qualcomm (QCOM) and other manufacturers of lower-power Arm components strive to compete in the Windows-PC market, historically dominated by Intel (INTC) processors.\n\nThe new Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chips are designed with a neural processing unit to accelerate AI-focused applications, such as Microsoft's Copilot software. These announcements come a day before Microsoft's annual developer conference, highlighting the company's strategy to strengthen its position in the AI tools market. Microsoft's collaboration with ChatGPT maker OpenAI has given it a competitive edge over Alphabet, as tech giants race to lead the emerging AI field.\n\nMarket Overview:\n\nThe unveiling of these AI-enhanced devices is part of Microsoft's broader plan to attract consumers willing to invest in advanced AI tools. Last week, both OpenAI and Google (GOOG) showcased competing AI technologies capable of real-time voice interactions, emphasizing the increasing importance of AI in consumer technology. Google (GOOGL) also introduced several generative AI features to its search engine, intensifying the competition among tech giants.\n\nMicrosoft's move to Arm-based chips follows the PC industry's pressure from Apple, which has seen success with its custom Arm-based processors that offer superior battery life and performance. Since 2016, Qualcomm has been leading the effort to transition Windows to Arm's chip designs, though this exclusivity is set to expire this year.

Microsoft is adding the ability to extend Copilot. Developers using Microsoft Copilot Studio or Microsoft Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code can create their own custom extensions.\n\nMicrosoft clearly thinks this is an idea with legs for independent developers because the company is offering a breakout session entitled \"Grow your business with Copilot extensions and marketplace.\" The main pitch is, \"Learn how your extensions can be monetized and how to get certified through the M365 Compliance program.\"\n\nAlso: 3 AI features coming to Copilot+ PCs that I wish were on my MacBook\n\nLet us know in the comments below if you think there's gold in them thar Copilot extension hills.\n\nIn addition to general Copilot extensions, Microsoft is announcing GitHub Copilot extensions. The press release contains barely a paragraph of information, but the one extension spotlighted is GitHub Copilot for Azure, which enables coders to develop, build, troubleshoot, and deploy apps on Azure. This feature showcases, \"How building in natural language with a broader range of capabilities can propel development velocity.\"\n\nThere is a Build breakout session on Extending GitHub Copilot. That's probably worth a look to get more details on where this all fits. Microsoft says the session will provide a \"sneak peak\" into the internals of GitHub Copilot.\n\nWe first discussed Azure AI Studio, Microsoft's all-in-one AI toolkit, at Ignite last November. Now, six months later, Azure AI Studio is generally available and allows users to build custom copilots that support custom applications like \"enterprise chat, content generation, data analysis, project management, automation of routine tasks and more,\" according to Microsoft.\n\nAlso: 7 ways to supercharge your Google searches with AI\n\nDevelopers can choose to build using what Microsoft calls a \"friendly user interface\" as well as through code. Developers will have access to all of Azure AI Studio's resources, including coding tools, the latest foundation models, a comprehensive AI toolchain, prompt flow orchestration, tracing and debugging, and monitoring of generative AI apps.\n\nBy the way, \"copilot\" written with a lower-case \"c\" is used to refer to any custom copilots users build. \"Copilot\" written with an upper-case \"C\" is used to refer to Microsoft's various branded Copilot offerings. And now you know.\n\nLast year at Build 2023, we discussed Microsoft's upcoming release of Dev Box, its coding-machine-as-a-service offering. Dev Box helps improve developer productivity by providing an on-demand coding environment along with enterprise management capabilities. This can substantially improve development workflows.\n\nAlso: 6 ways AI can help launch your next business venture\n\nThis year, Dev Box is generally available and Microsoft is adding new capabilities to its \"ready-to-code\" pre-configured programming environments. The company is adding team customizations and images, project-based catalogs, and an improved connection experience inside the Windows App.\n\nOn the enterprise management side, Dev Box connection telemetry will be available through the Azure Monitor, to help track performance data and system events. Developers can now automatically set their boxes to hibernate on disconnect, which could substantially reduce costs if developers regularly forget to hibernate their metered boxes before closing a connection.\n\nMicrosoft has extended Visual Studio Code with AI tool integration, giving developers a more seamless approach to developing and deploying intelligent applications.\n\nFrom within Visual Studio Code, developers will be able to acquire and run language models, choose local and cloud compute capabilities to optimize and finetune models, and then deploy models into Azure AI Studio using container images.\n\nWe spoke about Azure AI Search last fall, when Microsoft announced the capability at Inspire 2023. The idea of AI search is that the very customizable search service uses a wide variety of AI technologies to deliver a better search experience.\n\nAlso: What is Gemini? Everything you should know about Google's new AI model\n\nThese include vector and hybrid search (which uses advanced algorithms to provide more accurate and relevant search results), retrieval-augmented generation (which combines search results with generated content to improve accuracy and relevance), seamless data integrations (which allows unified search across various data sources for comprehensive results), enhanced search relevance (which improves the accuracy and relevance of search results based on user interactions), integrated vectorization (which understands the context and meaning of data for better search outcomes), and AI-powered insights and analytics (which provides insights and analytics to optimize and improve search performance).\n\nAzure Functions is a serverless compute service that allows developers to write code without the need to manage or provision infrastructure. It's useful for building microservices, automating workflows, and managing data streams. Developers can build small, reusable code chunks that can be combined into more complex applications, all without worrying about server infrastructure.\n\nKey features introduced at Build 2024 include a Flex Consumption Plan designed to give users more flexibility and customization, an extension that will allow developers to incorporate AI services in their projects, and a browser-based developer experience powered by Visual Studio Code for Web.\n\nAlso: The best AI search engines: Google, Perplexity, and more\n\nFor those looking for more of a deep dive, there's a lab session at Build entitled, Build and deploy serverless apps with Azure Functions and Azure AI at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday, May 21. The session will be repeated on May 22 at 2:15 p.m. and May 23 at 11:00 a.m. Unfortunately, these sessions are only in Seattle and will not be available online or recorded.\n\nMicrosoft also moved Azure Functions on Azure Container Apps and the Dapr extension for Azure Functions out of preview and into general availability.\n\nAzure App Service has been around for a long time, since 2015 or so. Like Azure Functions, Azure App Service is an Azure compute service, but while Azure Functions run, well, functions, Azure App Service runs entire web apps. With Azure Functions, you pay per execution. With Azure App Service, you pay based on the number and size of the instances you use.\n\nThe news here at Build 2024 is that Microsoft is showing three interesting new capabilities for Azure App Service that are in preview. Sidecar Patterns adds extra features alongside the main app. WebJobs Integration runs background tasks with web apps. GitHub Copilot Skills for Azure Migrate provides AI-assisted migration recommendations and support.\n\nAlso: Microsoft Azure gets 'Models as a Service,' enhanced RAG offerings for enterprise generative AI\n\nMicrosoft also announced that automatic scaling, availability zones, and TLS 1.3 encryption features are now in general availability.\n\nAzure Container Apps is another Azure compute service that lets customers run containerized applications and microservices with automatic scaling and integrated event-driven capabilities, without managing the underlying infrastructure. This service differs from Azure App Service in that it provides a flexible environment for any containerized workload rather than being specifically tailored for web applications.\n\nMicrosoft announced that it's now previewing the addition of dynamic sessions. This capability enables scalable, personalized, and efficient resource management, enhancing user experiences through real time updates and secure session handling. It also helps optimize costs by aligning resource usage with actual demand.\n\nMicrosoft also announced support for Java monitoring, and a dashboard for Microsoft .NET Aspire. These are also entering preview.\n\nAn API (application programming interface) is a set of defined programming calls that allows one program to use the features of another program or service. One of the ways programmers can save a lot of time is to choose powerful APIs that do a lot of the heavy lifting. For example, a programmer who wants to add some AI capabilities doesn't need to start from scratch inventing AI technology. Instead, they simply use an API, which accesses an AI service (like those we've talked about in this article) and the called service does all the heavy work.\n\nAlso: Microsoft Copilot vs. Copilot Pro: Is the subscription fee worth it?\n\nThe problem is that there are a tremendous number of APIs. Each API used adds complexity, security risks, billing and cost challenges, and vendor-v.s.-vendor incompatibility difficulties.\n\nLast year at Build 2023, Microsoft previewed Azure API Center, a tool designed to help companies manage their APIs by providing a centralized governance, discovery, and monitoring platform.\n\nNow, at Build 2024, Microsoft is announcing the general availability of the Azure API Center, along with additional capabilities to manage generative AI deployments. These include token limit policy for managing resource allocation, import of the Azure OpenAI Service endpoints as APIs, and a load balancer.\n\nWe hope you've enjoyed this lightning round of developer updates from Build.

Like you; we were also surprised to hear that Microsoft is reserving the most interesting AI feature to a selective lineup of processors by Snapdragon.\n\nThe hardware requirements to run Recall AI are equally high. To use this feature, your PC must have:\n\nDid you notice something weird in the requirements list? It's an ARM64 processor! Windows on ARM has a small user base compared to Intel and AMD's x64 processors. But there's more.\n\nYou need an ARM64 processor, and you need a specific version of it. According to the hardware requirements, the PC must have the Snapdragon X E with NPU to support the Recall AI feature.\n\nMicrosoft's stern hardware requirements for Recall AI will upset many users. Until now, Windows 11 users have only had access to Copilot, a glorified web result with summarization capabilities, at best.\n\nEnforcing such strict processor requirements excludes almost every Windows user, even those with AI processors from Intel and AMD. If you want to use Recall AI, upgrade to the upcoming lineup of Snapdragon X Elite PCs. But what is Recall AI?\n\nRecall AI makes your every past action searchable. That's the simplest explanation. The feature records your screen and uses that data to help you remember things.\n\nFor example, you want to refer to a conversation and extract some details. You can ask Recall AI to look into all the conversations with that specific person and then find the information on a report, a schedule, etc.\n\nWith Recall AI, finding files in a large download pileup or revisiting your browser history is easy. You can give commands to Recall AI in natural language, eliminating the need to type precise commands. You can converse with it like you do with another person in real life.\n\nThe feature runs natively and doesn't store data in the cloud (it would be a privacy nightmare). Windows Latest understands that all this real-time processing requires a powerful NPU, which is the current strength of Snapdragon X Elite.\n\nWith 45 TOPS NPU power, Snapdragon X Elite dominates Intel and AMD's current AI processors. However, upgrading to a new Windows PC for Recall AI isn't a big selling point, and Microsoft should rethink this.\n\nMicrosoft added a dedicated update history section for Recall AI in the Settings app and a new toggle for Privacy and Security settings. These updates do not appear under definition updates or other updates. However, you won't get to try Recall AI until the September/October 2024 update.", "source": {"uri": "windowslatest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Windows Latest"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abhishek_mishra@windowslatest.com", "name": "Abhishek Mishra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AArch64"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ARM architecture family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "X86-64"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.windowslatest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Dell-details-Windows-11-AI-requirements-but-its-not-enough-for-all-features.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Can artificial intelligence make the PC cool again? Microsoft, HP, Dell and others unveiled a new kind of laptop tailored to work with artificial intelligence. Analysts expect Apple to do something similar. (Grant Hindsley/The New York Times)\n\nThe race to put artificial intelligence everywhere is taking a detour through the good old laptop computer.\n\nMicrosoft on Monday introduced a new kind of computer designed for artificial intelligence. The machines, Microsoft says, will run AI systems on chips and other gear inside the computers so they are faster, more personal and more private.\n\nThe new computers, called Copilot+ PC, will allow people to use AI to make it easier to find documents and files they have worked on, emails they have read or websites they have browsed. Their AI systems will also automate tasks such as photo editing and language translation.\n\nThe new design will be included in Microsoft's Surface laptops and high-end products that run on the Windows operating system offered by Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung, some of the largest PC makers in the world.\n\nThe AI PC, industry analysts believe, could reverse a longtime decline in the importance of the personal computer. For the past two decades, the demand for the fastest laptops has diminished because so much software was moved into cloud computing centers. A strong internet connection and web browser was all most people needed.\n\nBut AI stretches that long-distance relationship to its limits. ChatGPT and other generative AI tools are run in data centers stuffed with expensive and sophisticated chips that can process the largest, most advanced systems. Even the most cutting-edge chatbots take time to receive a query, process it and send back a response. It is also extremely expensive to manage.\n\nMicrosoft wants to run AI systems directly on a personal computer to eliminate that lag time and cut the price. Microsoft has been shrinking the size of AI systems, called models, to make them easier to run outside of data centers. It said more than 40 will run directly on the laptops. The smaller models are generally not as powerful or accurate as the most cutting-edge AI systems, but they are improving enough to be useful to the average consumer.\n\nAnalysts expect Apple to follow suit next month at its conference for software developers, where the company will announce an overhaul for Siri, its virtual assistant, and an overall strategy for integrating more AI capabilities into its laptops and iPhones.", "source": {"uri": "telegraphindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop",

This combination presages what could be big performance and battery life improvements, along with some intriguing new ways of working.\n\nIntroducing the concept at a pre-Build press event, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella noted, \"If you go all the way back to the start of modern computing 70 years ago, the pursuit has always been about how to make computers that understand us instead of us having to understand computers. I feel like we really are close to that real great view.\"\n\nHe went on to describe \"the new user interface,\" which he argues is multimodal and can support text, images, and video for input and output. It has memory that maintains important context and recalls our personal knowledge, data across all of the applications and devices, and new reasoning capabilities that help us complete complex tasks.\n\n\"We're entering this new era where computers not only understand us but can actually anticipate what we want and our intents,\" he said.\n\nWhile the vision sounds great, it always takes a while for the products to catch up. Indeed, I've seen multiple introductions of Qualcomm-based PCs, and they've often fallen short of expectations. After the first \"AI PCs\" were announced a few months ago, I tested a bunch of them and was disappointed.\n\nNadella did recognize that some AI promises have yet to be realized, but said that AI capabilities are growing rapidly. \"Just like saying Moore's Law helped drive the Information Revolution, the scaling laws of deep neural networks are going to drive the Intelligence Revolution. [But] it's pretty early still on this platform shift.\"\n\nThe specifics here matter. Copilot+ PCs will require at least 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, an integrated NPU with 40 TOPs (trillions of operations per second) or more, Microsoft's Pluton security chip, and of course, a dedicated CoPilot key. The NPU performance number is important because it means the AI PCs that AMD and Intel have introduced to date do NOT qualify; presumably future machines based on AMD's \"Strix Point\" and Intel's \"Lunar Lake\" will.\n\nMicrosoft and partners put a great deal of stock into performance and battery life numbers, saying the new machines will allow for up to 15 hours of web browsing and up to 22 hours of video playback. (Some OEMs were even more aggressive). In particular, many of the demos were based on comparison with the MacBook Air with Apple's M3 processors.\n\nI was more interested in the new software. Microsoft Consumer Chief Marketing Officer Yusuf Mehdi said Windows itself was \"rearchitected\" to be faster and offer better battery life -- up to 53% faster than the M3-based Macbook Air, he said -- with the Copilot app redesigned so you can now resize, snap, or maximize it, and drag and drop things (like photos) into it.\n\nOther demos showed new photo features (including simple AI-based editing from within Explorer and notifications and summarizations). One of the more interesting applications was using it while running Minecraft and conversing with it via voice as it understood what was happening on screen and gave you hints. If it works that well in the real world, I'll be very impressed.\n\nPerhaps the biggest new feature is Recall, which lets you more easily find anything you've seen or done on your computer, including closed browser tabs, even if there is no text that exactly matches your prompt. The demos included finding a dress from a series of previous browser searches or finding a specific slide with a comment in purple writing. These looked quite useful, more so than the Windows Timeline feature introduced a few years back.\n\nMicrosoft says the Recall index is completely private, local, and secure, with safety features that allow you to edit or delete anything that has been captured. I'm sure many people will be looking at it with a focus on privacy.\n\nLive Captions, meanwhile, can automatically provide on-device captions to streamed videos or video conferencing. I particularly liked the demo of a video call with speakers in four different languages with real-time translation.\n\nReal-time translation and Recall were probably the two biggest standout demos for business users, although I'm sure the other features of Microsoft 365 Copilot will work as well.\n\nOther demos seemed more aimed at creators. Within Windows Paint and Image Creator, you can now sketch and enter text descriptions to get it to create new images for you. The Windows Photos app will include more AI features and upscaling. Third-party applications looked good as well, including Adobe Photoshop running its Firefly AI applications faster than on a MacBook and DaVinci Resolve doing quick color changes in one part of a video. They looked quite good.\n\nIn addition to Microsoft, which introduced new versions of its Surface Laptop and Surface Pro, Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung all introduced new Snapdragon-based machines. I'm particularly interested to note that this includes not only consumer laptops but also business-focused machines with the three major players.\n\nDell introduced five new laptops, including the Latitude 7455, which it said is the thinnest Latitude ever, and the slightly lower-end Latitude 5455. The test units on display included Arm-specific versions of Dell's enterprise suite, including Dell Command Center and Dell Optimizer.\n\nHP showed off the Elitebook Ultra G1g (Ultra will be HP's new name for what used to be its high-end Dragonfly line), with features like its Poly camera app and SureSense (although other parts of the Wolf security line are slated for later this year).\n\nLenovo showed its ThinkPad T14s Gen 6, with features like the TrackPoint QuickMenu and its Commercial Vantage software working.\n\nThis is a big step up from previous Qualcomm-based machines, which really didn't have the features enterprises are looking for. I was told that most enterprise management apps are available, but things for out-of-band management are not quite ready.\n\nStill, the consensus among the vendors I talked to at Monday's event was that the early business customers for Qualcomm-based machines will be enterprises that have fully migrated to Windows 11, use modern management, and probably have Arm-based Macs in their fleet.\n\nNote that Microsoft Office 365 and Edge apps and many third-party apps (including Google Chrome, WhatsApp, Zoom, Adobe, Photoshop, Disney+, and Spotify) now have Arm-based native applications for the new Qualcomm-based machines; and Windows now has a new \"Prism\" emulator for running x86 software. Again, the proof will be in the final machines due next month, but it sounds good.\n\nAll in all, it was a very impressive launch. It sure looks like Qualcomm may become a third CPU provider for Windows machines in a real way. But more importantly, it could mean a real change to the way we interact with software. I'm excited to test some of this out.", "source": {"uri": "me.pcmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PC Mag Middle East"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moore's law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deep learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "User interface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azure_Sphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Azure Sphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Videotelephony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_and_drop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drag and drop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_365", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft 365"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_me/news/c/copilot-pc/copilot-pcs-have-great-potential-but-will-businesses-care_vb3k.1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

BILL gives you automated expense reports, customizable spend control, and as many virtual cards as you need. Get Started.\n\nWhile Marc Andreessen and I disagree on what happened when Netscape went under, my perception was that Netscape blew its considerable lead on Microsoft in browsers by not adequately protecting it and not realizing the power of Microsoft marketing back then.\n\nMicrosoft's marketing capabilities have declined sharply since then. While it blindsided Google with Copilot on search, Microsoft failed to market the advantage successfully or advance it significantly enough to avoid a huge pushback from Google. That pushback happened last week at Google I/O, and it was an impressive showing.\n\nAnother weakness for Microsoft is that Google has focused on smartphones as the vehicle for its AI efforts, while Microsoft has focused on PCs. Google's path is probably the better one. As we move from text to voice interface and include ever more capabilities for the AI to see, it makes more sense to have it in a tool that is always with you rather than just on your desk or in your laptop bag.\n\nMuch like Microsoft's was with Netscape, I think Google's approach hits harder where people want AI to be.

Today, most people access AI either through an application like Grammarly or from the cloud through a browser interface. That's a problem if you want to use the same AI interface while away from your desk. The vendors believe, and I agree, that you'll prefer AI to be with you wherever you go, not just wait for you back at the office.\n\nIn addition, much like we changed the desktop hardware significantly when we went from mainframes and command line interfaces to graphical user interfaces, mice, and PCs, so, too, do I expect we'll change our endpoints when we move from the PC interfaces and accessories to an AI interface that is more like another human than like how we've worked with PCs in the past.\n\nThis change suggests that even smartphones may be at risk, but they are closer to where we'll end up than the PC is at this point. The Humane Ai Pin is an attempt, for instance, to find what that future device would look like -- and, like early smartphones, it isn't very close to what people want yet, but it is evolving much like smartphones did. So, I wouldn't write Humane out just yet.\n\nThis positioning puts Qualcomm in a really interesting spot because not only is it the leading provider of smartphone AI technology, but its Snapdragon X also currently leads the market in PC AI technology. It's rumored that Qualcomm will be taking center stage at Microsoft Build this week.\n\nSo, of all the high-end chip vendors, Qualcomm is the best positioned on both platforms to drive the client side of AI development. At the same time, Nvidia remains the most powerful technology provider in the server, high-performance computing, supercomputer, and workstation segments.\n\nQualcomm and Nvidia have never gotten along very well, but if they ever hooked up, they could own the entire AI wave. This speculation might add another interesting dynamic to the mix, given AMD and Intel are ramping up AI efforts impressively.\n\nRight now, both Google and Qualcomm have a significant advantage in the AI race. However, the race is very early, and I expect leadership to shift a lot. It might eventually go to some vendor like OpenAI, even though Microsoft just announced an impressive internal AI effort similar to what it did with Spyglass in the browser wars. So, it could flip the script this week at Build. That show will be worth attending.\n\nWith Qualcomm and Nvidia pushing the boundaries in AI hardware, it's crucial to keep an eye on how software developments complement these advancements. This brings us to the recent announcements from Google I/O, where several exciting new projects were unveiled.\n\nProject Astra has to be one of the coolest things I've seen so far. Your smartphone becomes another set of eyes that connect you to the power of AI to answer questions. These questions could be:\n\nProject Astra is a genuine assistant, and its capabilities will expand as it learns about more and more things. Since I'm a guy, and guys tend to toss out instructions, it will be a godsend for me for those times I've tossed the instructions and really shouldn't have.\n\nGemini Nano is Google's client-side implementation of Gemini and is in line with what Microsoft will be showcasing at Build. This feature will allow your Android smartphone to recognize images, sounds, and spoken languages you don't speak in real time. You can do voice searches for videos and pictures on your device, and you can film a problem you are having, and it will, assuming it knows, provide suggestions on how to fix it.\n\nRemember Google Glass and that it sucked a lot? Well, Google showcased a new pair of AR glasses in prototype form, suggesting it will make another run at this. They are wireless and can give you answers for what you are looking at when tied to Project Astra.\n\nThis capability supports the idea of a vastly different computing device than a smartphone, given that those who wear the glasses interact with the microphone and speakers in those glasses, not in the smartphone. They looked a ton better than Google Glass, but that is a pretty low bar.\n\nWhile I'm a little nervous about having anything listen to my calls, the increase in telephone fraud has me worried, particularly as bad actors spin up AI models to do that fraud. This Gemini-based tool listens in on your calls, warns you if it looks like you are being scammed, and recommends you disconnect from the call immediately.\n\nThis feature would have helped the older woman in the movie \"BeeKeeper\" significantly, but then the movie would have been far shorter. Thousands of people are scammed like she was every year, and this technology, while not the remedy the BeeKeeper used (which I'd prefer), it should significantly increase security around folks in every age group.\n\nInterestingly, Google's use of AI on Android reminds me a lot of Windows 95 in terms of how the interface is integrated, and Microsoft's use of AI, so far, reminds me more of Windows + DOS in that it is more of an overlay.\n\nI think this will force Microsoft to release Windows 12 earlier and, I hope, to fix its marketing problem because the numbers I've recently seen suggest a lot of people are going back to Windows 10 from Windows 11, putting Microsoft in a pickle in terms of driving the next upgrade, which reminds me again of some of the execution issues Netscape had with Navigator.\n\nWe've already had the release of Devin, the first AI software engineer from Cognition, but what Google announced was far more generic and likely a ton cheaper to buy.\n\nAI Teammate is an artificial intelligence co-worker that is like an executive secretary. It does what Microsoft promised some time ago but never really delivered with Cortana. Built on Workspace, Google called its AI \"Chip\" (I liked Cortana better), and it should be a massive help in meetings. I'm just hoping they'll do what Microsoft didn't and create a device like this Holographic Cortana Appliance.\n\nGoogle I/O was amazing this year, and we'll see how Microsoft responds this week. But this really points to the problem Microsoft has by not sticking with the Windows phone. I think this also showcases that Microsoft -- even though it hit first like Netscape did -- is a day late and a dollar short. The pivot will be more powerful on smartphones than it will be on PCs, which will be massively disruptive to those firms that don't have both platforms.\n\nIn the end, this year's event went down as the most important, informative, and interesting Google I/O so far, but we are still at the very start of the AI wave. I'm still a bit worried we are focusing on speed over quality. By the end of 2025, we should know whether Google is the new Microsoft and if Microsoft becomes the new Netscape.\n\nThe Lenovo ThinkBook 13X G4 is an outstanding notebook, and it's certainly one of the best-looking laptops I've tested so far. Sleek and 2.2 lbs., it is ready for AI and has impressive speakers for a 13-inch laptop. You can configure the notebook with either an Intel Core Ultra 5 for around $1,400 or an Intel Core Ultra 9 for around $2,000.\n\nBattery life is up to 21 hours of video, 11.4 hours of web browsing, and 8.4 hours of video conferencing, and Office gives this notebook decent battery life. It has one of the largest batteries in its class (according to Lenovo, it is the largest in its class), so you should be able to leave your charger on your desk or in your hotel room. I'm a big fan of 20+ hours of battery life.\n\nIt does not have USB Type-A ports, but it does have three USB Type-C (Thunderbolt 4) ports, which is better.\n\nConnectivity is Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2, which is about as current as you can get now (I have yet to see a Wi-Fi 7 notebook). This Lenovo ThinkBook is one of the first products with Intel's Meteor Lake processor, which gives it good AI support.\n\nThe ThinkBook 13x G4 laptop has pogo pins to attach Lenovo's Magic Bay Studio with its 4K camera for videoconferencing. (Image Credit: Lenovo)\n\nThe display has 500 nits, which should make it viewable outdoors (I haven't tried that yet). It also has Dolby Vision support for brilliant colors, particularly when watching movies.\n\nIf you want to configure the product fully, you can get up to 32 GB of memory and up to 1 TB of Gen 4 SSD storage. It uses the new Intel ARC Integrated Graphics.\n\nThe Lenovo ThinkBook 13x G4 AI PC is an impressive piece of kit, my new favorite notebook, and my Product of the Week!", "source": {"uri": "technewsworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechNewsWorld"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netscape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer mouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Redundancy (engineering)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mainframe computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marc Andreessen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supercomputer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Command-line interface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphical user interface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortana_(virtual_assistant)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cortana (virtual assistant)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google Glass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lenovo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Computer", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Computer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/tech-race.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

Why trust us?\n\nCopilot+ PCs represent a new era for Windows. Microsoft's implementation of AI is key to these new devices, of course, but so is the transition to ARM. Although Copilot+ isn't limited to Qualcomm's ARM chips, right now they have exclusivity because of the required 40 TOPS performance of the NPU in these devices.\n\nContents Microsoft Surface LaptopSamsung Galaxy Book4 EdgeDell XPS 13 (9345)HP OmniBook X 14Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x\n\nThat means these new laptops are thin, powerful, and have fantastic battery life -- a fantastic antidote to the MacBook Air. Though we haven't reviewed any in-depth yet, here are our favorites from among the ones we've seen in person so far.\n\nRecommended Videos Microsoft Surface Laptop\n\nThe Surface Laptop was always supposed to be a true competitor to the MacBook Air. The design was sleek, and it's always been quite thin. However, it always struggled with two particular problems: performance and battery life. As a Copilot+ PC with the Snapdragon X chips under the hood, though, the latest Surface Laptop easily jumps these hurdles. All of a sudden, it looks like it finally has the chance to live up to its potential.\n\nMicrosoft took the opportunity to introduce some tweaks to the aesthetic too -- for the first time in many years. It has thinner bezels, a larger haptic feedback trackpad, and some new color options. All that to say, the new Surface Laptop is the Copilot+ PC I'm most eager to spend more time with. The Copilot+ program belongs to Microsoft, so I anticipate it to be the flagship option. Add in a starting price of $999, and you have a really solid value.\n\nThough this list is focused on laptops, I should mention the new Surface Pro too. The 2-in-1 remains a unique device, but will hopefully inspire a new generation of Windows tablets and detachable 2-in-1s, benefitted by the vast improvement in performance and battery life. I'm particularly excited for that gorgeous OLED screen, which looks fantastic.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Book4 Edge\n\nSamsung is known for making ultra-thin laptops, and the two they're bringing to the Copilot+ take things even further. At 0.43 inches thick, they're thinner even than a MacBook Air. Key to this, of course, is the ARM chip inside, which allows for such extreme efficiency without sacrificing performance. The size alone makes it one of the devices I'm most excited to test out on this list.\n\nSamsung is bringing two size options to the table: 14-inch and 16-inch. Both are exceedingly thin and come with an AMOLED screen, though the 16-inch model has a couple of extra features, such as an HDMI port, an even larger touchpad, and some larger storage configurations.\n\nSamsung is also introducing a new feature that connects its products together. Copilot on your PC will be able to connect directly to Phone Link and run tasks on your Samsung phone or tablet.\n\nThere are some Samsung-isms here that I don't prefer, whether that's the large bottom bezel or number pad (in the 16-inch model), but the Galaxy Book4 Edge represents just how thin these devices can get.\n\nThe 14-inch model starts at $1,350, while the 16-inch model starts at $1,450.\n\nDell XPS 13 (9345)\n\nThe Copilot+ version of the XPS 13 looks identical to the current Intel model that's available, model number 9340. As much as a new design would have been appreciated, Dell already has something fairly cutting edge with the current version of the XPS 13. The new design isn't beloved by all -- in fact, it's rather controversial. The seamless glass trackpad invisibly blends into the palm rests, making for an incredibly modern, minimalist aesthetic. The capacitive touch buttons that replace the function row of keys are perhaps the most derided aspect of the design, as is the lack of a headphone jack.\n\nBut if you can get past those quirks, the XPS 13 should really come alive with the Snapdragon X Elite on deck. There's no laptop as premium and forward-thinking as the XPS 13, and this new, powerful ARM chip inside ensures that its performance and battery life are up to par against the M3 MacBook Air. So, what's exciting about the XPS 13 9345 is that we're finally getting the most premium Windows laptops on ARM. That really says something about the confidence in these new chips and Microsoft's ability to support them. It's currently selling for just $50 more than the Intel version. Based on the performance and battery life claims, I can't imagine why you'd still opt for Intel's.\n\nThe Dell XPS 13 will start at $1,300, coming with a Snapdragon X Elite, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage.\n\nHP OmniBook X 14\n\nHP took the exact opposite approach as Dell, taking the chance to rebrand its entire line of laptops. Gone are the familiar Spectre and Envy brands -- now replaced by Omni. The top-of-the-line device so far is the OmniBook X 14, a Copilot+ PC with a pretty stark new look. There's no question that HP is gunning for the MacBook aesthetic here, but the OmniBook X 14 definitely has its own vibe, especially with the all-white model.\n\nThe chassis looks incredibly thin, and the soft, rounded edges are appealing. The design language of the keyboard, and colored accents along the function row keys make this one stand out -- both from HP's previous laptops and the other Copilot+ options.\n\nThe OmniBook X 14 will start at $1,150 for a Snapdragon X Elite configuration with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage.\n\nLenovo Yoga Slim 7x\n\nOne of the promises of improved CPU efficiency is the ability to have thinner laptops. The Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x is one of the thinnest laptops of the bunch, coming in at 0.5 inches thick and weighing less than 3 pounds. It also features a 14.5-inch OLED screen, a quad-speaker sound system (with upward-firing tweeters), and a large touchpad.\n\nIt otherwise bares a lot of resemblance to other Lenovo Yoga laptops, only smaller, more powerful, and much longer lasting. Setting aside the AI features, that's the biggest strength of the Copilot+ platform. All in all, these are just much better all-around laptops than what has come before in this class of Windows laptop.\n\nThe best part? This is only the beginning. If this all ends up being a successful operation, hopefully we'll see more inventive designs that push the limits of what's possible when built around these efficient chips.\n\nEditors' Recommendations The MacBook monopoly just got overturned This was the most momentous PC announcement in decades Microsoft just kicked off a new era of PCs with Copilot+ The 5 best things you can do with Copilot Pro right now Whatever you do, don't buy a Windows laptop right now", "source": {"uri": "digitaltrends.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Trends"}, "authors": [{"uri": "luke_larsen@digitaltrends.com", "name": "Luke Larsen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ARM architecture family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_XPS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dell XPS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Surface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Galaxy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surface Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchpad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haptic technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Trends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital Trends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edge (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Display device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surface Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop_Customization", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop Customization", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/samsung-edge-1.jpg?resize=800%2C418&p=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

So, the incorporation of several powerful AI-powered systems is also expected.\n\nAs a note quoted by The Verge read: \"It's clear Microsoft has grown tired of Intel's failed attempts at a comeback, so it's going all-in on these latest Qualcomm chips -- and bringing its closest PC partners along for the ride.\"", "source": {"uri": "thenews.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News International"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Windows 10"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chipset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surface Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MacBook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2024-05-19/l_1190887_080847_updates.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 136, "textEnd": 142}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

The leak included multiple photographs of the laptop from a variety of angles, as well as the new wallpaper, which joins the series of Windows 11 signature Bloom wallpapers (Neowin has a collection of others you can view and download). Neowin speculates that the new AI-focused PCs will ship with the new background.\n\nAccompanying the leak, X user @cadenzza_ shared a high-resolution version of the brand new Bloom wallpaper variation (apparently shared in a private Windows Insider Telegram group originally) that you can download by saving the image below or from @cadenzza_'s post, and set on your device.\n\nIt's interesting how closely Microsoft's been guarding what it's about to share, with this static wallpaper being one of the things that we can confirm at all. Neowin has proposed that Microsoft might be crafting new desktop background effects for Windows 11, perhaps making use of the next-generation devices' AI capabilities, and creating effects simulating depth, and possibly making the background reactive to how you move your cursor.\n\nWe'll have to see if this is the case at some point in the next few days as Microsoft Build goes on. We expect the announcement of consumer versions of the Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 laptops with Qualcomm Snapdragon X processors, and whatever AI innovations Microsoft wants to bring to our attention. Another new hardware introduction we expect is a Copilot keyboard button, which has been discussed for a while now.

This combination presages what could be big performance and battery life improvements, along with some intriguing new ways of working.\n\nIntroducing the concept at a pre-Build press event, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella noted, \"If you go all the way back to the start of modern computing 70 years ago, the pursuit has always been about how to make computers that understand us instead of us having to understand computers. I feel like we really are close to that real great view.\"\n\nHe went on to describe \"the new user interface,\" which he argues is multimodal and can support text, images, and video for input and output. It has memory that maintains important context and recalls our personal knowledge, data across all of the applications and devices, and new reasoning capabilities that help us complete complex tasks.\n\n\"We're entering this new era where computers not only understand us but can actually anticipate what we want and our intents,\" he said.\n\nWhile the vision sounds great, it always takes a while for the products to catch up. Indeed, I've seen multiple introductions of Qualcomm-based PCs, and they've often fallen short of expectations. After the first \"AI PCs\" were announced a few months ago, I tested a bunch of them and was disappointed.\n\nNadella did recognize that some AI promises have yet to be realized, but said that AI capabilities are growing rapidly. \"Just like saying Moore's Law helped drive the Information Revolution, the scaling laws of deep neural networks are going to drive the Intelligence Revolution. [But] it's pretty early still on this platform shift.\"\n\nThe specifics here matter. Copilot+ PCs will require at least 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, an integrated NPU with 40 TOPs (trillions of operations per second) or more, Microsoft's Pluton security chip, and of course, a dedicated CoPilot key. The NPU performance number is important because it means the AI PCs that AMD and Intel have introduced to date do NOT qualify; presumably future machines based on AMD's \"Strix Point\" and Intel's \"Lunar Lake\" will.\n\nMicrosoft and partners put a great deal of stock into performance and battery life numbers, saying the new machines will allow for up to 15 hours of web browsing and up to 22 hours of video playback. (Some OEMs were even more aggressive). In particular, many of the demos were based on comparison with the MacBook Air with Apple's M3 processors.\n\nRecall, Live Captions, and New Creator Tools\n\nI was more interested in the new software. Microsoft Consumer Chief Marketing Officer Yusuf Mehdi said Windows itself was \"rearchitected\" to be faster and offer better battery life -- up to 53% faster than the M3-based Macbook Air, he said -- with the Copilot app redesigned so you can now resize, snap, or maximize it, and drag and drop things (like photos) into it.\n\nOther demos showed new photo features (including simple AI-based editing from within Explorer and notifications and summarizations). One of the more interesting applications was using it while running Minecraft and conversing with it via voice as it understood what was happening on screen and gave you hints. If it works that well in the real world, I'll be very impressed.\n\nPerhaps the biggest new feature is Recall, which lets you more easily find anything you've seen or done on your computer, including closed browser tabs, even if there is no text that exactly matches your prompt. The demos included finding a dress from a series of previous browser searches or finding a specific slide with a comment in purple writing. These looked quite useful, more so than the Windows Timeline feature introduced a few years back.\n\nMicrosoft says the Recall index is completely private, local, and secure, with safety features that allow you to edit or delete anything that has been captured. I'm sure many people will be looking at it with a focus on privacy.\n\nLive Captions, meanwhile, can automatically provide on-device captions to streamed videos or video conferencing. I particularly liked the demo of a video call with speakers in four different languages with real-time translation.\n\nReal-time translation and Recall were probably the two biggest standout demos for business users, although I'm sure the other features of Microsoft 365 Copilot will work as well.\n\nOther demos seemed more aimed at creators. Within Windows Paint and Image Creator, you can now sketch and enter text descriptions to get it to create new images for you. The Windows Photos app will include more AI features and upscaling. Third-party applications looked good as well, including Adobe Photoshop running its Firefly AI applications faster than on a MacBook and DaVinci Resolve doing quick color changes in one part of a video. They looked quite good.\n\nPC Makers Embrace Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite\n\nIn addition to Microsoft, which introduced new versions of its Surface Laptop and Surface Pro, Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung all introduced new Snapdragon-based machines. I'm particularly interested to note that this includes not only consumer laptops but also business-focused machines with the three major players.\n\nDell introduced five new laptops, including the Latitude 7455, which it said is the thinnest Latitude ever, and the slightly lower-end Latitude 5455. The test units on display included Arm-specific versions of Dell's enterprise suite, including Dell Command Center and Dell Optimizer.\n\nHP showed off the Elitebook Ultra G1g (Ultra will be HP's new name for what used to be its high-end Dragonfly line), with features like its Poly camera app and SureSense (although other parts of the Wolf security line are slated for later this year).\n\nLenovo showed its ThinkPad T14s Gen 6, with features like the TrackPoint QuickMenu and its Commercial Vantage software working.\n\nThis is a big step up from previous Qualcomm-based machines, which really didn't have the features enterprises are looking for. I was told that most enterprise management apps are available, but things for out-of-band management are not quite ready.\n\nStill, the consensus among the vendors I talked to at Monday's event was that the early business customers for Qualcomm-based machines will be enterprises that have fully migrated to Windows 11, use modern management, and probably have Arm-based Macs in their fleet.\n\nNote that Microsoft Office 365 and Edge apps and many third-party apps (including Google Chrome, WhatsApp, Zoom, Adobe, Photoshop, Disney+, and Spotify) now have Arm-based native applications for the new Qualcomm-based machines; and Windows now has a new \"Prism\" emulator for running x86 software. Again, the proof will be in the final machines due next month, but it sounds good.\n\nAll in all, it was a very impressive launch.

(Image credit: Daniel Rubino)\n\nI've covered Windows PCs for 12 years since Microsoft introduced the first Surface laptops in 2012. That Windows device and the controversial Windows 8 operating system started a new era of convertible laptops (and the first Windows on Arm attempt with Windows RT).\n\nAmidst the ebb and flow of convertible laptops and other industry initiatives, the emergence of new 'Copilot+ PCs' stands out as a transformative force, surpassing the impact of convertibles in every way.\n\nToday's announcement from Microsoft and its partners signals a major shift in the PC industry. Termed the 'Great PC Reset' by myself, it signifies the convergence of cutting-edge ARM64 processors from Qualcomm, powerful neural processing units (NPUs), generative AI, and PC manufacturers, all rallying around the concept of the AI PC.\n\nFurthermore, it signifies a resurgence of fundamental computing principles and simplicity.\n\nHere's why and how this technology merger is poised to redefine our perception of Windows laptops, marking a tectonic shift comparable to the impact nearly 30 years ago by Microsoft's Windows 95 and the emergence of the Internet.\n\nLet's face it: Qualcomm's journey with Windows on ARM over the past seven years has been challenging. Initially introduced as an initiative in 2016, Microsoft rightly viewed its foray into ARM32 (and later ARM64) and support for Intel and AMD (x86-64) as a long-term commitment. While the benefits of Windows on ARM (WoA) were evident, such as significantly improved battery life, the journey turned into a slog after 5 years, with modest but slow advances in chip performance. However, Qualcomm's strategic acquisition of Nuvia will change the game.\n\nIt's important to acknowledge the considerable challenges that Qualcomm has faced. Technically, it didn't design its own processors but relied on existing designs by Arm Ltd., which it then licensed and modified. This dependency on Arm Ltd. meant that if they didn't design a CPU that could outperform Intel's latest Core processor, neither could Qualcomm. It's a complex landscape, and understanding these challenges is key to appreciating the industry's dynamics.\n\nAnother significant hurdle was the 'chicken and egg problem' with ARM64 compatibility. The lack of widespread adoption of Qualcomm-based Snapdragon laptops meant that software developers saw little incentive to recompile apps for ARM64. Conversely, without ARM64-compiled apps, consumers and enterprises saw little reason to tolerate the significantly slower app emulation. This led to sluggish market growth for WoA despite the gradual adoption of ARM64 compatibility by Windows 11 and apps.\n\nLuckily, Qualcomm stumbled upon a solution. In Mach 2021, Qualcomm acquired for $1.4 billion a tiny startup named Nuvia, founded in 2019 by three former Apple engineers (Gerard Williams III, Manu Gulati, and John Bruno). While Nuvia originally planned to build ARM-based chips for data centers, Qualcomm saw a different opportunity with its newly acquired talent.\n\nAnd Gerard Williams III, Manu Gulati, and John Bruno weren't just Apple engineers. They led development on Apple's A-series chips (used in iPhones and iPads, which scaled up to the current M-series) and were experts in System-on-Chip (SoC) design and architecture. Indeed, before Gerard Williams III worked at Apple, he spent 12 years designing chips at Arm Limited (previously ARM Holdings) and Texas Instruments. His pedigree in ARM chip design is legendary.\n\nThese people led Apple's 10-year run up to the famed Apple M processors used in its MacBook laptops. The fact that they now work for and are designing in-house ARM64 processors for Qualcomm is likely one reason Apple filed a lawsuit against Williams (and Arm Ltd. filed one against Qualcomm), who was accused of poaching Apple employees (Apple later dropped the lawsuit in early 2023 after it was believed to have settled).\n\nIf anyone doubts that Qualcomm could give Apple a run for its money in silicon, they're probably not paying attention to who is now working for Qualcomm.\n\nWhile it took three years to get to this point, in summer 2024, we'll finally see the results of Qualcomm's Nuvia acquisition, and they're nothing short of staggering. Qualcomm's new Snapdragon processors are going from least performant in the market to the most in one fell swoop, bypassing Intel and AMD for power and efficiency and besting Apple's bestselling M3 processor found in the popular MacBook Pro laptops.\n\nBut this was all planned since 2021 and that Nuvia acquisition. What wasn't planned was the meteoric rise of generative AI and the need for AI accelerators (NPUs). Luckily, Qualcomm also had an ace up its sleeve for that. When partnered with Microsoft's massive AI pivot, it will create the perfect storm of new, powerful, and long-lasting \"AI PCs.\"\n\nOn November 30, 2022, OpenAI, a company few had ever heard of, released ChatGPT to the public. It had reached one million users just five days later, which was unprecedented.\n\nWhile 'bots' have been around forever and the industry's use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been tossed around (primarily as shorthand for machine learning, a subset of AI), ChatGPT changed the world as the first practical and fascinating conversational AI. Soon, people were using ChatGPT to write papers, cheat on homework, create books to flood Amazon with books, make investments, and more.\n\nIt was only two and half months later that Microsoft, who had partnered with OpenAI back in 2019 with a $1 billion investment (later, it invested $10 billion in January 2023 to enhance that partnership), got on stage in a hastily assembled media briefing to show off how ChatGPT can power Bing Search and Bing Chat (later rebranded to Microsoft Copilot). Even the new experimental Bing garnered over one million signups in 48 hours.\n\nMicrosoft's move was genius. It famously usurped Google's Gemini announcement weeks later, making Google look behind and wholly caught off guard, especially since everyone expected Google to be the AI leader, not Microsoft.\n\nSince February 2023, it has been a whirlwind for OpenAI and Microsoft. The latter has deployed Copilot across everything from GitHub to the web, its Edge browser, standalone applications for iOS and Android, and built it into Outlook, Office, and Windows 11 itself.\n\nREAD MORE: Best AI PC in 2024: Intel and AMD laptops with CPU, GPU, and NPU for tasks powered by artificial intelligence\n\nHowever, one of the current problems with generative AI is processing. Until now, the large-language models (LLMs) had to be housed on massive servers with just as massive GPUs to make the queries timely enough to be acceptable. But data still had to be uploaded and then downloaded from the user, adding latency, not to mention queuing for your query due to high user demand.\n\nAnother problem is that general LLMs are good at inference for public data but don't do much for personalized data, whether for the individual or the corporation (not to mention privacy and security concerns).\n\nThat's where localized and private 7-billion-parameter LLMs come into relevance. Companies can now invest in so-called \"AI Factories\" (see Dell's announcement today), which provide companies with everything from powerful servers to the laptops needed to create, train, run inference, and deploy LLMs that are based on internal company data.\n\nWhen combined with cloud-based search data, this so-called hybrid AI approach takes generative AI to a new level. This is why enterprises are so enamored with AI. Private LLMs can act like an \"AI genie\" for a company, like a universal secretary, knowledgable in company-specific data, documents, training guides, and resources, making them potentially invaluable assistants to employees instead of glorified web search engines.\n\nHowever, having an AI accelerator or a neural processing unit (NPU) to run these systems on a laptop is critical. Think of an NPU like a CPU and GPU; instead, it is optimized to run AI data efficiently and speedily. Sure, you can game on a laptop without a discrete GPU, but having one is better. The same applies to running AI.\n\nIntel's latest Core Ultra processors (Meteor Lake) run 11 trillion operations per second (TOPS), which helps with things like Windows Studio Effects (background blurring, gaze correction, etc.), but will choke on 7-billion-parameter LLMs, which are the threshold for generating high-quality outputs, rivaling human-generated content.\n\nAMD and Apple also have NPUs on their chips. Apple's new M4, currently only in the new iPad Pro, hit 38 TOPS (up from just 18 TOPS in M3), while AMD's latest Ryzen chips still fall below 20.\n\nBut Qualcomm's new Snapdragon X Elite/Plus chips hit 45 TOPS, making them the most potent NPUs in any laptop. Intel will reach this second-generation NPU level later this year with its 'Lunar Lake' chips, but Qualcomm is now king, and laptop makers, Microsoft, and software developers have noticed.\n\nToss in Microsoft's advancements announced today, like Windows 11 Recall and AI Explorer, which for now is exclusive to Snapdragon X laptops, and you have the first genuine \"AI PC,\" or as the industry calls them, \"Copilot+ PC.\" Here's what Windows Central exclusively reported back in December 2023 about Microsoft's plan for Windows 11:\n\nMicrosoft's blockbuster new feature will be the introduction of an AI-powered Windows Shell, enhanced with an \"advanced Copilot,\" that's able to constantly work in the background to enhance search, jumpstart projects or workflows, understand context, and much more. Sources say these AI features will be \"groundbreaking.\"\n\nMicrosoft is releasing the first \"true\" AI operating system, putting itself ahead of Google and Apple, which are trying to catch up. However, Microsoft can only do this because Qualcomm has a chip that can process AI to make it happen. Without that 45 TOPS NPU, this whole thing falls apart, which is why (for now) Intel and AMD laptops aren't getting these features.\n\nNone of this hyperbole, either. HP announced today that it is rebranding its entire PC lineup. From the consumer side, Pavilion, Envy, and Spectre are gone; we now have Omni and demarcations to reflect processing power and pricing levels, e.g., HP OmniBook 3, 5, 7, X, and Ultra. For categories, there is the HP OmniBook for laptops, OmniStudio for all-in-one desktops, and OmniDesk for traditional desktops. (Gaming still falls under the OMEN branding, however).\n\nFor HP's commercial portfolio, everything is unified under Elite, such as HP EliteBook, EliteStudio, and EliteDesk.\n\nWhy is HP doing this? Its old naming scheme wasn't simple (and Spectre was spelled oddly for those in the U.S.), but I didn't see complaints. HP sees today's announcement for Qualcomm's chip and Microsoft's AI push as a chance to reset. (It should be noted that Elite and Omni PCs are not Qualcomm-exclusive devices but apply to forthcoming Intel and AMD ones.)\n\nEven Microsoft's Surface ambitions have been scaled back in an apparent reboot with the departure of its originator, Panos Panay, and head designer, Ralf Groene. The days of radical Surface experiments are over as the company pulls back to core products (and the ones that sell) like Surface Pro, Surface Laptop, and its 'Go' counterparts.\n\nWhether Dell, Lenovo, and others will follow HP and Microsoft is unclear, but it is evident that many of these companies are taking today's announcements seriously. We expect just under 20 new Snapdragon-based laptops in the coming weeks, matching what Qualcomm referred to last year as a \"significant number of design wins,\" leading to what it referred to as an \"inflection point\" for Windows on Arm in mid-2024.\n\nTo put that number of laptops in perspective, on average, we would see one, maybe two new Windows on Arm laptops per year. And this is just the beginning.\n\nCounterpoint Research and other industry analysts have pegged 2024 as the first year of growth in the PC market after many years of decline thanks to these AI PCs. I suspect 2025 will be an even more considerable boost as businesses enter their refresh cycle for computers bought during the pandemic era. Riding that wave will be these new AI PCs.\n\nOf course, while impactful, I can hear people talking about convertible laptops didn't radically change things for PC users. I think that is somewhat true, although Microsoft's Surface Pro, I'd argue, is now iconic, and Lenovo has seen success with its Yoga series for years.\n\nHowever, most shifts in the PC landscape in the last decade have revolved around form factors (or modified OS UIs), including recent attempts at dual-screen laptops, something we claimed way back in 2018 was in the works and PCs with foldable displays.\n\nThis PC Reset is not about form factors. Indeed, it's the opposite.\n\nMost laptops announced today are vanilla old-school clamshell Windows laptops with killer displays and fast RAM and storage. Even 5G and so-called \"always-connected\" functions are taking a backseat as Qualcomm is not mandating its adoption when using Snapdragon X. As a result, most laptop makers are keeping designs simple (and more affordable) by not incorporating costly and complicated 5G antennas and hardware.\n\nNo, today's Copilot+ laptops are about three things:\n\nThe Copilot+ laptops' lightweight, standard clamshell design caters to consumers and businesses. They resemble MacBook Pros but are lighter, offer more design choices, and, crucially, offer a range of options such as touchscreens, 5G, or even tablet PC configurations like the Surface Pro. Moreover, they boast the capability to run Windows 11, which carries a legacy of over 30 years of software support.\n\nIn the future, we can expect to see an array of convertible laptops, an increase in tablet options, dual-screen/foldable devices, and perhaps even handheld gaming PCs.\n\nFor the moment, however, the Windows PC industry is pausing to refocus, returning to its origins, and resetting to introduce some of the most powerful laptops ever created. This shift is set to herald a new era of authentic and reliable AI computing.\n\nToday's announcements change the landscape entirely. The introduction of Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon X processors or the emergence of an AI OS alone would be significant. But their powerful (and serendipitous) combination marks a watershed moment for a mobile computing revolution that has been unparalleled in the past 30 years since PCs were first connected to the Internet.\n\nAnd if you think that's all garbage, just be happy you can now get a Windows laptop that's as fast and battery-efficient as Apple's.", "source": {"uri": "windowscentral.com", "dataType":

Those bits of paper held the keys to your kingdom -- in other words, it's where we scribbled down cheats for GTA III, San Andreas or Vice City. Microsoft is rendering the modern equivalent of paper cheats or guides (the internet) almost irrelevant by shoving Copilot into some of its games, Minecraft first.\n\nThe AI integration into games was announced during the search giant's Surface event yesterday, where the headline of the show was the shiny new Copilot+ PCs and, unsurprisingly, a couple of upgraded Surface laptops. That's all to be expected from Microsoft, but the company's plans to infect its games with AI got a raised eyebrow out of us.\n\nTo give Copilot the necessary social skills to pull something like this off, Microsoft has kitted it out with OpenAI's new GPT-4o model. The big kicker is GPT-4o's ability to see, hear and talk in a more natural human-like way -- with OpenAI cutting down response time to an average of 320ms.\n\nMicrosoft showed off a demo of a player interacting with the new GPT-4o-fied Copilot helping out a new Minecraft player and teaching him the ropes, like how to craft a stone sword. The AI can comprehend general questions, and even give you help depending on where a player is standing, or the materials in their inventory.\n\nMicrosoft confirmed that this is all happening locally on your device, and won't get back to its servers or be used to train its other language models.

Of course, we have had one of them on the Mac for a few years.\n\nRecall is the most interesting feature we have seen in Copilot+. With the, we will be able to remember anything we have done on our PC with the ease of asking. That document that we accidentally deleted, a web page that you visited and now cannot be found in the history... The functionalities are many.\n\nFor Mac there is an application that allows you to do something similar, it is called Rewind and we have talked about it in Applesfera. While Let's see if it is integrated natively into macOS 15it is a good option if you found Windows 11 Recall interesting.\n\nWindows 11 with Copilot+ will be able to translate more than 40 languages in local, without having to use the cloud. We have something similar with the Apple translator, although it is not yet integrated into the subtitles. This It will be really easy to view on Mac taking into account the power of its processors.\n\nThis functionality helps improve the quality of an image and increase its size. We have something similar on the Mac with third-party applications, so perhaps we will see this integration with the Photos App in the new version of macOS 15.\n\nIs about lighting effects to use in video calls. We have already had this on the Mac and the iPhone for years, so this time you can use them now on your Apple devices.\n\nWith all the new Microsoft news presented, All eyes are on June 10. Date on which Apple's WWDC will be held and we will finally know everything that Apple has planned for us. There are many rumors of artificial intelligence focused on Siri and iPhone Apps, but macOS 15 is sure to also have a handful of surprising features.", "source": {"uri": "gearrice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gearrice"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_frawley@gearrice.com", "name": "James Frawley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Siri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Emulation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Emulation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://i.blogs.es/fa6dc5/apple-microsoft/840_560.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 2414, "textEnd": 2421}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

As the first \"AI PC\" Surface devices, the Pro 10 for Business tablet and its more traditional sibling, the Laptop 6, seemed disappointing. And the fact that you could only buy it on Microsoft's website, or through enterprise resellers, made it seem as if the company was trying to hide its shame.\n\nBut after testing the Surface Pro 10 tablet (I'll omit the \"For Business\" part of its name for the rest of the review, you get it), I realized Microsoft just wanted to make a PC upgrade to appease IT workers. It's boring; there aren't any major new features to learn, and your company's existing Windows software will all work just fine. No alarms, no surprises.\n\nI can accept this Surface Pro 10 for what it is because we know Microsoft has some intriguing consumer-focused Surface hardware on the horizon. The company has invited media to an event in Seattle on May 20th (a day before its Build conference begins), where we expect to see some consumer-focused Surface devices powered by Qualcomm's new Snapdragon X Elite chips. It makes sense for Microsoft to take a bigger risk with its consumer hardware, instead of the machines IT workers need to manage.\n\nBoth the Surface Pro 10 and Laptop 6 for Business are powered by Intel's new Core Ultra chips. These are the company's first processors to include an NPU for handling AI tasks. Admittedly, there aren't many AI-driven features in Windows 11 yet, but we're expecting to see Microsoft sell some new AI capabilities at Build.\n\nFor now, having an NPU means you can use Windows Studio Effects, which can glam up your video chats with blurred backgrounds and other features. By tapping into your NPU, instead of your CPU or GPU, Windows 11 can also handle those tasks more efficiently, and without slowing down the rest of your system. Who wouldn't want that?\n\nDesign-wise, the Surface Pro 10 is almost exactly the same as the Pro 9 -- the 13-inch 120Hz PixelSense screen returns, and Microsoft is still relying on its clunky kickstand to prop up the tablet. But at least the company shoved in a new 1440p webcam with a wider field of view, which should lead to clearer video chats.\n\nIn spite of its lack of updates, the Surface Pro 10 is still a reliable and capable hybrid tablet. It delivered fast performance, a great display and excellent battery life. Here are my favorite things about it:\n\nFor a machine that starts at $1,200 though, the Surface Pro 10 is lacking in a few key ways:\n\nAt this point, you're better off waiting to see how Microsoft's new consumer-focused Surface hardware performs before investing in either the Pro 10 or Laptop 6. But, as I said at the start, these systems aren't really meant for consumers anyway.

Thanks in part to a chip dedicated to AI processing, the company said, the machines from Microsoft's Surface line and other manufacturers will be more powerful and 58% faster than Apple's top-of-the-line MacBook Air M3. The new hardware will start at $1,000 and ship on June 18.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with Big Tech rivals in AI but is poised to lay out an ambitious strategy at its Worldwide Developers Conference next month. The company is placing high-end chips -- similar to ones it designed for the Mac -- in cloud-computing servers created to process the most advanced AI tasks coming to Apple devices, Bloomberg reported previously. Simpler AI-related features will be processed directly on iPhones, iPads and Macs.\n\nApple will focus on features that make life easier for users as they go about their day -- say, by making suggestions and offering a customized experience.\n\nMicrosoft is leveraging its relationship with leading AI startup OpenAI to forge an early lead in the burgeoning field of generative AI services. But the partnership has come under regulatory scrutiny. Officials in the US, Europe and the UK are examining Microsoft's AI investments, as well as those of its rivals, to determine whether they impinge on competition or should be regulated more similarly to mergers.\n\nNadella said his company's partnerships are increasing competition in the nascent field rather than constraining it.\n\n\"Today there is formidable amount of competition, right?\" he said. \"Whether it is between the big players or the small players.

That Windows device and the controversial Windows 8 operating system started a new era of convertible laptops (and the first Windows on Arm attempt with Windows RT).\n\nAmidst the ebb and flow of convertible laptops and other industry initiatives, the emergence of new 'Copilot+ PCs' stands out as a transformative force, surpassing the impact of convertibles in every way.\n\nToday's announcement from Microsoft and its partners signals a major shift in the PC industry. Lenovo, HP, Dell, Acer, ASUS, Samsung, and Microsoft announced new laptops for this category, and they hit store shelves next month.\n\nI have termed this the 'Great PC Reset,' which signifies the convergence of cutting-edge ARM64 processors from Qualcomm, powerful neural processing units (NPUs), generative AI, and PC manufacturers rallying around the concept of the AI PC.\n\nFurthermore, it signifies a resurgence of fundamental computing principles and simplicity.\n\nHere's why and how this technology merger is poised to redefine our perception of Windows laptops, marking a tectonic shift comparable to the impact nearly 30 years ago by Microsoft's Windows 95 and the emergence of the Internet.\n\nLet's face it: Qualcomm's journey with Windows on ARM over the past seven years has been challenging. Initially introduced as an initiative in 2016, Microsoft rightly viewed its foray into ARM32 (and later ARM64) and support for Intel and AMD (x86-64) as a long-term commitment. While the benefits of Windows on ARM (WoA) were evident, such as significantly improved battery life, the journey turned into a slog after 5 years, with modest but slow advances in chip performance. However, Qualcomm's strategic acquisition of Nuvia will change the game.\n\nIt's important to acknowledge the considerable challenges that Qualcomm has faced. Technically, it didn't design its own processors but relied on existing designs by Arm Ltd., which it then licensed and modified. This dependency on Arm Ltd. meant that if they didn't design a CPU that could outperform Intel's latest Core processor, neither could Qualcomm. It's a complex landscape, and understanding these challenges is key to appreciating the industry's dynamics.\n\nAnother significant hurdle was the 'chicken and egg problem' with ARM64 compatibility. The lack of widespread adoption of Qualcomm-based Snapdragon laptops meant that software developers saw little incentive to recompile apps for ARM64. Conversely, without ARM64-compiled apps, consumers and enterprises saw little reason to tolerate the significantly slower app emulation. This led to sluggish market growth for WoA despite the gradual adoption of ARM64 compatibility by Windows 11 and apps.\n\nLuckily, Qualcomm stumbled upon a solution. In Mach 2021, Qualcomm acquired for $1.4 billion a tiny startup named Nuvia, founded in 2019 by three former Apple engineers (Gerard Williams III, Manu Gulati, and John Bruno). While Nuvia originally planned to build ARM-based chips for data centers, Qualcomm saw a different opportunity with its newly acquired talent.\n\nAnd Gerard Williams III, Manu Gulati, and John Bruno weren't just Apple engineers. They led development on Apple's A-series chips (used in iPhones and iPads, which scaled up to the current M-series) and were experts in System-on-Chip (SoC) design and architecture. Indeed, before Gerard Williams III worked at Apple, he spent 12 years designing chips at Arm Limited (previously ARM Holdings) and Texas Instruments. His pedigree in ARM chip design is legendary.\n\nThese people led Apple's 10-year run up to the famed Apple M processors used in its MacBook laptops. The fact that they now work for and are designing in-house ARM64 processors for Qualcomm is likely one reason Apple filed a lawsuit against Williams (and Arm Ltd. filed one against Qualcomm), who was accused of poaching Apple employees (Apple later dropped the lawsuit in early 2023 after it was believed to have settled).\n\nIf anyone doubts that Qualcomm could give Apple a run for its money in silicon, they're probably not paying attention to who is now working for Qualcomm.\n\nWhile it took three years to get to this point, in summer 2024, we'll finally see the results of Qualcomm's Nuvia acquisition, and they're nothing short of staggering. Qualcomm's new Snapdragon processors are going from least performant in the market to the most in one fell swoop, bypassing Intel and AMD for power and efficiency and besting Apple's bestselling M3 processor found in the popular MacBook Pro laptops.\n\nBut this was all planned since 2021 and that Nuvia acquisition. What wasn't planned was the meteoric rise of generative AI and the need for AI accelerators (NPUs). Luckily, Qualcomm also had an ace up its sleeve for that. When partnered with Microsoft's massive AI pivot, it will create the perfect storm of new, powerful, and long-lasting \"AI PCs.\"\n\nOn November 30, 2022, OpenAI, a company few had ever heard of, released ChatGPT to the public. It had reached one million users just five days later, which was unprecedented.\n\nWhile 'bots' have been around forever and the industry's use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been tossed around (primarily as shorthand for machine learning, a subset of AI), ChatGPT changed the world as the first practical and fascinating conversational AI. Soon, people were using ChatGPT to write papers, cheat on homework, create books to flood Amazon with books, make investments, and more.\n\nIt was only two and half months later that Microsoft, who had partnered with OpenAI back in 2019 with a $1 billion investment (later, it invested $10 billion in January 2023 to enhance that partnership), got on stage in a hastily assembled media briefing to show off how ChatGPT can power Bing Search and Bing Chat (later rebranded to Microsoft Copilot). Even the new experimental Bing garnered over one million signups in 48 hours.\n\nMicrosoft's move was genius. It famously usurped Google's Gemini announcement weeks later, making Google look behind and wholly caught off guard, especially since everyone expected Google to be the AI leader, not Microsoft.\n\nSince February 2023, it has been a whirlwind for OpenAI and Microsoft. The latter has deployed Copilot across everything from GitHub to the web, its Edge browser, standalone applications for iOS and Android, and built it into Outlook, Office, and Windows 11 itself.\n\nREAD MORE: Best AI PC in 2024: Intel and AMD laptops with CPU, GPU, and NPU for tasks powered by artificial intelligence\n\nHowever, one of the current problems with generative AI is processing. Until now, the large-language models (LLMs) had to be housed on massive servers with just as massive GPUs to make the queries timely enough to be acceptable. But data still had to be uploaded and then downloaded from the user, adding latency, not to mention queuing for your query due to high user demand.\n\nAnother problem is that general LLMs are good at inference for public data but don't do much for personalized data, whether for the individual or the corporation (not to mention privacy and security concerns).\n\nThat's where localized and private 7-billion-parameter LLMs come into relevance. Companies can now invest in so-called \"AI Factories\" (see Dell's announcement today), which provide companies with everything from powerful servers to the laptops needed to create, train, run inference, and deploy LLMs that are based on internal company data.\n\nWhen combined with cloud-based search data, this so-called hybrid AI approach takes generative AI to a new level. This is why enterprises are so enamored with AI. Private LLMs can act like an \"AI genie\" for a company, like a universal secretary, knowledgable in company-specific data, documents, training guides, and resources, making them potentially invaluable assistants to employees instead of glorified web search engines.\n\nHowever, having an AI accelerator or a neural processing unit (NPU) to run these systems on a laptop is critical. Think of an NPU like a CPU and GPU; instead, it is optimized to run AI data efficiently and speedily. Sure, you can game on a laptop without a discrete GPU, but having one is better. The same applies to running AI.\n\nIntel's latest Core Ultra processors (Meteor Lake) run 11 trillion operations per second (TOPS), which helps with things like Windows Studio Effects (background blurring, gaze correction, etc.), but will choke on 7-billion-parameter LLMs, which are the threshold for generating high-quality outputs, rivaling human-generated content.\n\nAMD and Apple also have NPUs on their chips. Apple's new M4, currently only in the new iPad Pro, hit 38 TOPS (up from just 18 TOPS in M3), while AMD's latest Ryzen chips still fall below 20.\n\nBut Qualcomm's new Snapdragon X Elite/Plus chips hit 45 TOPS, making them the most potent NPUs in any laptop. Intel will reach this second-generation NPU level later this year with its 'Lunar Lake' chips, but Qualcomm is now king, and laptop makers, Microsoft, and software developers have noticed.\n\nToss in Microsoft's advancements announced today, like Windows 11 Recall and AI Explorer, which for now is exclusive to Snapdragon X laptops, and you have the first genuine \"AI PC,\" or as the industry calls them, \"Copilot+ PC.\" Here's what Windows Central exclusively reported back in December 2023 about Microsoft's plan for Windows 11:\n\nMicrosoft's blockbuster new feature will be the introduction of an AI-powered Windows Shell, enhanced with an \"advanced Copilot,\" that's able to constantly work in the background to enhance search, jumpstart projects or workflows, understand context, and much more. Sources say these AI features will be \"groundbreaking.\"\n\nMicrosoft is releasing the first \"true\" AI operating system, putting itself ahead of Google and Apple, which are trying to catch up. However, Microsoft can only do this because Qualcomm has a chip that can process AI to make it happen. Without that 45 TOPS NPU, this whole thing falls apart, which is why (for now) Intel and AMD laptops aren't getting these features.\n\nNone of this hyperbole, either. HP announced today that it is rebranding its entire PC lineup. From the consumer side, Pavilion, Envy, and Spectre are gone; we now have Omni and demarcations to reflect processing power and pricing levels, e.g., HP OmniBook 3, 5, 7, X, and Ultra. For categories, there is the HP OmniBook for laptops, OmniStudio for all-in-one desktops, and OmniDesk for traditional desktops. (Gaming still falls under the OMEN branding, however).\n\nFor HP's commercial portfolio, everything is unified under Elite, such as HP EliteBook, EliteStudio, and EliteDesk.\n\nWhy is HP doing this? Its old naming scheme wasn't simple (and Spectre was spelled oddly for those in the U.S.), but I didn't see complaints. HP sees today's announcement for Qualcomm's chip and Microsoft's AI push as a chance to reset. (It should be noted that Elite and Omni PCs are not Qualcomm-exclusive devices but apply to forthcoming Intel and AMD ones.)\n\nEven Microsoft's Surface ambitions have been scaled back in an apparent reboot with the departure of its originator, Panos Panay, and head designer, Ralf Groene. The days of radical Surface experiments are over as the company pulls back to core products (and the ones that sell) like Surface Pro, Surface Laptop, and its 'Go' counterparts.\n\nWhether Dell, Lenovo, and others will follow HP and Microsoft is unclear, but it is evident that many of these companies are taking today's announcements seriously. We expect just under 20 new Snapdragon-based laptops in the coming weeks, matching what Qualcomm referred to last year as a \"significant number of design wins,\" leading to what it referred to as an \"inflection point\" for Windows on Arm in mid-2024.\n\nTo put that number of laptops in perspective, on average, we would see one, maybe two new Windows on Arm laptops per year. And this is just the beginning.\n\nCounterpoint Research and other industry analysts have pegged 2024 as the first year of growth in the PC market after many years of decline thanks to these AI PCs. I suspect 2025 will be an even more considerable boost as businesses enter their refresh cycle for computers bought during the pandemic era. Riding that wave will be these new AI PCs.\n\nOf course, while impactful, I can hear people talking about convertible laptops didn't radically change things for PC users. I think that is somewhat true, although Microsoft's Surface Pro, I'd argue, is now iconic, and Lenovo has seen success with its Yoga series for years.\n\nHowever, most shifts in the PC landscape in the last decade have revolved around form factors (or modified OS UIs), including recent attempts at dual-screen laptops, something we claimed way back in 2018 was in the works and PCs with foldable displays.\n\nThis PC Reset is not about form factors. Indeed, it's the opposite.\n\nMost laptops announced today are vanilla old-school clamshell Windows laptops with killer displays and fast RAM and storage. Even 5G and so-called \"always-connected\" functions are taking a backseat as Qualcomm is not mandating its adoption when using Snapdragon X. As a result, most laptop makers are keeping designs simple (and more affordable) by not incorporating costly and complicated 5G antennas and hardware.\n\nNo, today's Copilot+ laptops are about three things:\n\nThe Copilot+ laptops' lightweight, standard clamshell design caters to consumers and businesses. They resemble MacBook Pros but are lighter, offer more design choices, and, crucially, offer a range of options such as touchscreens, 5G, or even tablet PC configurations like the Surface Pro. Moreover, they boast the capability to run Windows 11, which carries a legacy of over 30 years of software support.\n\nIn the future, we can expect to see an array of convertible laptops, an increase in tablet options, dual-screen/foldable devices, and perhaps even handheld gaming PCs.\n\nFor the moment, however, the Windows PC industry is pausing to refocus, returning to its origins, and resetting to introduce some of the most powerful laptops ever created. This shift is set to herald a new era of authentic and reliable AI computing.\n\nToday's announcements change the landscape entirely. The introduction of Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon X processors or the emergence of an AI OS alone would be significant. But their powerful (and serendipitous) combination marks a watershed moment for a mobile computing revolution that has been unparalleled in the past 30 years since PCs were first connected to the Internet.\n\nAnd if you think that's all garbage, just be happy you can now get a Windows laptop that's as fast and battery-efficient as Apple's.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Why trust us?\n\nMicrosoft might be able to put out the Nvidia Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) killer that companies like AMD and Intel have been gunning for. A new feature included with Copilot+ PCs is Auto SR, which is an AI-assisted upscaling tool similar to DLSS. It's exclusive to Copilot+ PCs for now, but Microsoft is leaving the door open for other platforms.\n\nAlthough Microsoft hasn't confirmed that Auto SR will run on the Neural Processing Unit (NPU) inside Copilot+ PCs, the fact that it's an exclusive feature for now provides a pretty strong hint. On the Copilot+ page, Microsoft also says that Auto SR is only available in \"a curated set of games\" at release, suggesting that the feature requires per-game integration.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nBefore you fret that this feature is exclusive to Copilot+ PCs, this doesn't sound like the DirectSR feature we heard about in March. That utility brings together upscalers like DLSS, FSR, and XeSS under a unified framework so that all of the tools are available in games. Auto SR is actually an upscaling feature. I've reached out to Microsoft to clarify the differences, and I'll update this article when I hear back.\n\nDespite the exclusivity for now, it sounds like Microsoft is planning on bringing Auto SR to more devices. The description reads: \"At initial launch, this feature will be exclusive to Copilot+ PCs equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite processor,\" suggesting that broader support will be available eventually.\n\nGet your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox! Privacy Policy\n\nThat would make sense. Although NPUs are widely available in laptops, they're starting to show up in desktops, too. AMD's Ryzen 8000 desktop processors already feature an NPU, and Intel says its upcoming Arrow Lake CPUs launching this year will feature one as well. If Auto SR is running on the NPU, there's a good chance Microsoft will roll out the feature more widely down the line.\n\nWe first heard about Auto SR earlier this year, where it accidentally showed up in some preview builds of Windows 11. At the time, PCWorld was able to get its hands on the feature, noting that it didn't provide any boost in performance. That, once again, suggests that the feature is running on the NPU and wasn't functioning properly at the time.\n\nThere's no timeline for when we might see Auto SR more broadly. Other Copilot+ features, such as Recall, will eventually be available through a Windows update, and Auto SR shouldn't be any different.\n\nEditors' Recommendations Sorry, Microsoft -- I don't want Copilot+ reading my DMs yet The new Surface Laptop and Surface Pro are finally living up to their potential Microsoft finally kills this legacy Windows app -- for good this time In 2024, there's no contest between DLSS and FSR New Nvidia update suggests DLSS 4.0 is closer than we thought", "source": {"uri": "digitaltrends.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Trends"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_roach@digitaltrends.com", "name": "Jacob Roach", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning_super_sampling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deep learning super sampling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhood_planning_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Neighborhood planning unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Trends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital Trends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PC game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_World", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PC World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Store", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/surface-laptop-studio-2-review-05.jpg?resize=800%2C418&p=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

The new PCs are being seen as an attempt by Microsoft to leverage the power of generative AI in reigniting the long-standing rivalry with the Apple MacBooks. Notably, Apple had gotten a leg up on its Windows counterparts with the switch from Intel to its own ARM based M series chipsets. Now, Microsoft is trying to bring on the competition with the addition of Snapdragon's ARM-based chipset, which are touted to be around 58% faster and 20% longer battery life than the MacBook Air with M3 chipset.\n\nThe Redmond based company is also introducing a new AI feature, which in the words of CEO Satya Nadella, will provide 'photographic memory' to the new laptops. The feature called 'Recall' will allow users to remember things that they have previously seen on their PCs by navigating across different apps, websites or documents.\n\nThe feature essentially takes screenshots of everything that's on a user's screen and then uses the power of generative AI to help navigate the thing that the user may be looking for.\n\nWhile talking about the new feature in an interaction with the Wall Street Journal, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said, \"One of the dreams we've always had is how do we introduce photographic memory into what you do on the PC and now we have it. So it's called recall, not keyword search, right? It's semantic search over all your history. And it's not just about any document, we can recreate moments from the past.\n\nMicrosoft explained that the new feature works on the user's personal semantic index and leverages the small language model inside the laptop to complete the tasks on-device. Moreover, the company also states that all the screenshots are saved on device and processed through the on-device model in order to enhance user's privacy. The company also stated that users will have the ability to stop a particular app or website from being tracked by the AI or turn off the feature altogether.\n\nUnlock a world of Benefits!

My Best Buy Plus or My Best Buy Total members can summon a free 50-inch TV just by buying a select Copilot+ device.\n\nThe brand of TV you get depends on the brand of Copilot PC+ device you get: Buying a Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge unlocks a free 50-inch Samsung DU7200 Series 4K TV (a $379.99 value) while buying something like a Surface Pro, HP OmniBook, Lenovo Yoga Slim, or Dell XPS unlocks a free 50-inch Insignia F30 Series 4K TV (a $299.99 value, or $219.99 when on sale). Copilot+ models participating in the deal are still in the preorder zone, with shipping beginning next month. Prices range between $999.99 and $2,099.99.\n\nMy Best Buy Plus and My Best Buy Total are the two paid tiers of the store's rewards program, costing $49.99/year and $179.99/year, respectively. Joining grants perks like free two-day shipping, exclusive prices and access to sales, extended return windows, and more.\n\nHaving a device armed with the latest version of Copilot comes with a lot of sweet capabilities: You can edit a photo without opening an app, use \"Recall\" to access anything you've ever seen on your PC, enact live translation, and more. As if Apple wasn't already shaking enough, the new Surface Laptops also feature new Qualcomm Snapdragon X chips -- a true M3 chip competition.\n\nThe two TVs, on the other hand, aren't the most colorful or contrasted 50-inch TVs you could find.

Apart from introducing novel capabilities natively to Windows, Microsoft has also partnered with third-party software developers. Here is a look at what is new.\n\nRecall is a timeline view that allows users to easily review their past activity on a machine. Users can also search through natural language or images to scroll back through time and get specific text or visual matches. The entire timeline is stored locally, with built-in privacy controls. This feature solves the frustrating problem of going back to something that we know we have seen on our PCs. This feature is especially helpful for remembering particular folders or web pages, or even emails.\n\nThe capabilities are similar to identifying a song by humming a tune, but here the tune is anything you recall, and the song is all your past activity. Users can also scroll through the content to revisit applications, websites and documents. Each of the snapshots have a screenplay based on object recognition. A personal semantic index is built and stored locally on your device, and remain there. Users can delete individual snapshots, as well as pause the timeline recording at any point of time. Users also have the option of preventing certain apps and websites from ever being saved.\n\nCreating on the cloud has its own share of issues, including having to wait, limits to the number of images that can be created, and potential privacy concerns. Microsoft is leveraging NPUs and powerful local small language models to integrate cocreation capabilities with Paint and Photos.\n\nUsers can provide rough sketches or strokes, and then combine them with text prompts to generate new images natively on the device. These images can be iterated on, refined, edited and evolved, all using AI. Microsoft has also introduced the Restyle app that allows users to reimagine their photos with image generation and photo editing, right through the native Photos app. Pre-set styles are available to change the background or the foreground.\n\nThe Copilot+ PCs have a number of AI-integrated capabilities for improving video calls. We are already seeing devices on the market with Windows Studio Effects that allows for Automatic framing, Eye contact maintenance using AI and realtime Background effects. Microsoft's Live Captions can translate more than 40 languages into English for speakers in real-time videocalls, recordings as well as streamed content.\n\nWindows has expanded Studio Effects with flattering portrait lighting and enhanced noise cancellation. These features are easily accessible in Quick Settings. There are also a number of 'Creative Filters', which seem to be realtime style transfer for video calls.\n\nThe flagship Adobe Apps including Photoshop, Lightroom and Express are available on Copilot+ PCs. Later in the year, Microsoft plans to introduce Adobe Premiere Pro along with other software. These applications are being optimised for NPUs. Users can now effortlessly apply visual effects to objects and people using Magic Mask in DaVinci Resolve Studio.\n\nWith CapCut, users can easily remove the background from any video. We just wish this particular capability would have been available in ClipChamp. Cephable offers more responsive input controls for gaming, powered by the NPU, that allows users to use voice controls, head movement and facia expressions to control the PC and even play games. LiquidText allows for making quicker and smarter annotations to documents, while ensuring security. Algoriddim's djay Pro software also allows users to break down and remix any track, using the NPU.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aditya_madanapalle@news9live.com", "name": "Aditya Madanapalle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web page"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Original equipment manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Videotelephony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semantics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DaVinci_Resolve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DaVinci Resolve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Lightroom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Lightroom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djay_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Djay (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Premiere_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Premiere Pro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop_Customization", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop Customization", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office_Suites", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office Suites", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Recall-Feature.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

Microsoft's new Surfaces are, we're told, just two of 20 \"Copilot+ PCs\" Qualcomm says it will launch with X Elite and Plus chips starting June 18.\n\nFirst teased last autumn, the 4nm TSMC-made X processor pair are among Qualcomm's first to use a Nuvia-derived Arm-compatible CPU core design. If you don't recall, Qualcomm acquired Nuvia back in 2021 for $1.4 billion, kicking off a still-ongoing lawsuit with Arm along the way.\n\nWe're told the X Plus has ten CPU cores, and the X Elite will sport 12. The Elite can clock up to 4 to 4.2 GHz for two cores, or up to 3.4 to 3.8 GHz for all cores; the Plus can go up to 3.4 GHz for all cores. If Microsoft is to be believed, Qualy's chips are more than ready to give Apple's homegrown silicon a run for its money.\n\nCiting Geekbench 2024, Redmond says its X Elite-equipped Surface Laptop delivers higher multi-threaded performance than Apple's M3 MacBook Air. It doesn't appear Microsoft has published those results just yet, but similar submissions from Acer and others would seem to back those claims up.\n\nHaving said that, single core performance does appear to be higher on the M3. So that would mean Apple's eight-core M3 in the MacBook Air is faster per CPU core, though Qualcomm wins out by throwing more CPU cores and potentially more power at the benchmark.\n\nIt isn't clear how much power the X Elite needs to hit that mark. When Qualcomm unveiled the X Elite last year, we were told the chip could be configured up to 50 watts. For reference, the M3 is widely believed to have a TDP of around 20 watts.\n\nWe've reached out to Microsoft for comment on how hot it's letting Qualcomm's chips run, and the IT giant declined to say anything on the subject. As usual and as such, we recommend taking any and all vendor benchmark claims with a decent pinch of salt.\n\nIn any case, it appears that, equipped with a 12-core X Elite, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of flash storage, Microsoft's Surface Laptop will at least be cheaper than Apple's latest MacBook Air. So, in terms of performance per dollar, Microsoft may have an edge.\n\nAlongside Qualcomm's new Snapdragon duo, Microsoft is also rolling out an emulation layer called Prism, presumably for running legacy x86 apps on the laptop's Arm cores. The software giant claims that, using this emulation layer, its latest-gen Surfaces are as much as two times faster than the older Arm-based Surface Pro 9.\n\nThe good news is you may not need emulation much longer. Microsoft says there are already native versions of Office, Chrome, Spotify, Zoom, WhatsApp, Blender, the Affinity suite, and Davinci Resolve ready to run on the machines. Meanwhile, Adobe has committed to bringing its apps to Windows on Arm.\n\nIt probably doesn't hurt that Apple started its transition to Arm four years ago, and many of these apps already have Arm64 compatible binaries.\n\nHowever, building a performance-competitive Arm notebook SoC is arguably secondary to the NPU found at the heart of the X pair. Capable of pushing 45 TOPS of ML performance at INT8, the X Elite and Plus are claimed to be the only part available today that meets Microsoft's 40 TOPS target -- something, we'll note, Qualcomm was keen to highlight in its own launch announcement.\n\nAs it stands, Intel and AMD's rival parts - the Intel 14th-gen (Meteor Lake) and AMD Ryzen 8040-series - top out at 10 and 16 TOPS respectively. Qualcomm's lead won't last forever. While Intel had previously teased that its upcoming Lunar Lake Core processors would deliver 45 NPU TOPS, it revealed on Monday that the chip's integrated GPU was capable of pushing another 60 TOPS, bringing the chip's total output to more than 100 TOPS when it hits the market in Q3.\n\nWe expect similar gains from AMD when its next-gen Ryzen processors arrive later this year. Until those chips hit the market it seems that Qualcomm has the AI PC market cornered.\n\nCompared to Apple's M3, Qualcomm boasts its silicon has up to 2.6x higher NPU performance. However, while the Neural Engine in the M3 maxes out at 18 TOPS, Apple's newly announced M4 SoCs are capable of pushing this to 38 or maybe higher. Unfortunately, that chip is only available in the iGiant's pricey iPad Pros.\n\nAs for what you'll do with all those NPU TOPS, Microsoft says they'll enable a variety of new AI features coming to Windows. This includes Cocreator for on-device art-generation in Paint; and live captions in things like video calls. And then there's Recall...\n\nMicrosoft also touted several apps which have added support for NPU acceleration, including Davinci Resolve, Cephable, and CapCut.\n\nQualcomm's X Plus and X Elite promise impressive performance and the NPU grunt Microsoft needs to advance its AI PC agenda, but the chips are also at odds with Arm's trajectory.\n\nAs we mentioned before, Arm is none too happy that Qualcomm acquired Nuvia and is now designing its own Arm-compatible CPU cores; both Qualcomm and Nuvia are Arm licensees, and Arm isn't thrilled at the way Qualcomm acquired and ingested Nuvia's Arm-compatible technology. So unhappy, in fact, that Arm sued Qualcomm over the whole debacle, arguing the Snapdragon maker was in breach of its architectural license with Arm and needed to negotiate a new one to use Nuvia's designs, no doubt a much higher price.\n\nNuvia's cores are also a step backward as far as some in the Arm world are concerned. As we understand it, the Nuvia-derived CPU cores at the heart of Qualcomm's X-series SoCs are based on the older Armv8 architecture and rely on a combination of GPU and NPU acceleration for speeding up AI workloads along with Arm's usual NEON CPU-level instructions.\n\nBy contrast, Arm has spent the past few years baking AI-accelerating features - such as Scalable Matrix Extensions 2, or SME2 - into its newer Armv9 CPU architecture. These are already being employed by Apple in its M4 Armv9 SoCs.\n\nQualcomm's decision to move away from Armv9 -- the tech giant has previously employed the architecture in its smartphone SoCs -- and its CPU-level improvements in favor of offloading AI work to NPUs means the Arm world is facing a potential divide: On one side, you've got Microsoft and Qualcomm today pushing Armv8 processors with custom units to specifically handle ML code; and on the other, you've got Arm trying to get people onto Armv9 where AI-accelerating instructions are baked into the CPU architecture as standard.\n\nConsidering Microsoft has thrown its weight behind Qualcomm's Armv8 chips in its quest to drive AI features out of the datacenter and out to the client; Apple being Apple; Google in love with its own on-device ML accelerators; and Samsung and MediaTek floating in the middle, we feel for developers - from OS and framework makers to app builders - trying to achieve maximum portability and maximum performance on Arm. \u00ae", "source": {"uri": "theregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "theregister.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOPS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TOPS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emulator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Multi-core processor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Surface Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thread (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silicon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acer Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AArch64"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DaVinci_Resolve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DaVinci Resolve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blender (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "X86"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Emulators", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://regmedia.co.uk/2024/05/20/microsoft_npu_concept.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 642, "textEnd": 649}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

A new feature included with Copilot+ PCs is Auto SR, which is an AI-assisted upscaling tool similar to DLSS. It's exclusive to Copilot+ PCs for now, but Microsoft is leaving the door open for other platforms.\n\nAlthough Microsoft hasn't confirmed that Auto SR will run on the Neural Processing Unit (NPU) inside Copilot+ PCs, the fact that it's an exclusive feature for now provides a pretty strong hint. On the Copilot+ page, Microsoft also says that Auto SR is only available in \"a curated set of games\" at release, suggesting that the feature requires per-game integration.\n\nBefore you fret that this feature is exclusive to Copilot+ PCs, this doesn't sound like the DirectSR feature we heard about in March. That utility brings together upscalers like DLSS, FSR, and XeSS under a unified framework so that all of the tools are available in games. Auto SR is actually an upscaling feature. I've reached out to Microsoft to clarify the differences, and I'll update this article when I hear back.\n\nDespite the exclusivity for now, it sounds like Microsoft is planning on bringing Auto SR to more devices. The description reads: \"At initial launch, this feature will be exclusive to Copilot+ PCs equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite processor,\" suggesting that broader support will be available eventually.\n\nThat would make sense. Although NPUs are widely available in laptops, they're starting to show up in desktops, too. AMD's Ryzen 8000 desktop processors already feature an NPU, and Intel says its upcoming Arrow Lake CPUs launching this year will feature one as well. If Auto SR is running on the NPU, there's a good chance Microsoft will roll out the feature more widely down the line.\n\nWe first heard about Auto SR earlier this year, where it accidentally showed up in some preview builds of Windows 11. At the time, PCWorld was able to get its hands on the feature, noting that it didn't provide any boost in performance. That, once again, suggests that the feature is running on the NPU and wasn't functioning properly at the time.\n\nThere's no timeline for when we might see Auto SR more broadly. Other Copilot+ features, such as Recall, will eventually be available through a Windows update, and Auto SR shouldn't be any different.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning_super_sampling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deep learning super sampling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhood_planning_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neighborhood planning unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_World", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PC World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Emulation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Emulation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/tu6akAf3rFEHcGMbCtckpQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/digital_trends_973/1716080d7bbb0041dd12ebd41b126a13", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

Listen! New Minecraft AI guide offers tips while watching you play", "body": "Microsoft demo is like chatting with GameFAQs when you don't have a friend to hang with.\n\nLongtime gamers (and/or Game Grumps fans) likely know that even single-player games can be a lot more fun with a friend hanging out nearby to offer advice, shoot the breeze, or just offer earnest reactions to whatever's happening on screen. Now, Microsoft is promising that its GhatGPT-4o-powered Copilot system will soon offer an imitation of that pro-social experience even for Minecraft players who don't have any human friends available to watch them play.\n\nIn a pair of social media posts Monday, Microsoft highlighted how \"real-time conversations with your AI companion copilot\" can enhance an otherwise solitary Minecraft experience. In the first demo, the disembodied copilot voice tells the player how to craft a sword, walking him through the process of gathering some wood or stone to go with the sticks sitting in his inventory. In another, the AI identifies a zombie in front of the player and gives the (seemingly obvious) advice to run away from the threat and \"make sure it can't reach you\" by digging underground or building a tower of blocks.\n\nThese kinds of in-game pointers aren't the most revolutionary use of conversational AI -- even a basic in-game tutorial/reference system or online walkthrough could deliver the same basic information, after all. Still, the demonstration stands out for just how that information is delivered to the player through a natural language conversation that doesn't require pausing the gameplay even briefly.\n\nThe key moment highlighting this difference is near the end of one of the video demos, when the Copilot AI offers a bit of encouragement to the player: \"Whew, that was a close one. Great job finding shelter!\" That's the point when the system transitions from a fancy voice-controlled strategy guide to an ersatz version of the kind of spectator that might be sitting on your couch or watching your Twitch stream. It creates the real possibility of developing a parasocial relationship with the Copilot guide that is not really a risk when consulting a text file on GameFAQs, for instance (though I think the Copilot reactions will have to get a bit less inane to really feel like a valued partner-in-gaming).\n\nJust hanging out with my AI buddy\n\nFurther ReadingIt's unclear from the video clips whether Copilot is reading data directly from the Minecraft instance or simply reacting to the same information the player is seeing. But the social media posts came the same day as Microsoft's announcement of \"Recall,\" a coming feature that \"take[s] images of your active screen every few seconds\" to provide a persistent \"memory\" of everything you do on the computer. That feature will be exclusive to Copilot+ PCs, which use an integrated Neural Processing Unit for on-device processing of many common generative AI tasks.\n\nFurther ReadingMicrosoft's Minecraft copilot demo brings to mind some of the similar conversations that OpenAI showed off during last week's live demo of ChatGPT-4o. But the artificial game-adjacent conversation here sounds significantly more robotic and direct than the lifelike, emotional responses in ChatGPT's presentation. Then again, ChatGPT has come under fire from actress Scarlett Johansson for using a voice that sounds too much like her performance in a 2013 movie about a conversational AI. Microsoft might be on safer ground sticking with a voice that is more obviously artificial here.\n\nSpeaking of Her, we can't help but think of one particular scene in that movie where Joaquin Phoenix's Theodore asks for gaming advice both from the titular AI and a hilariously potty-mouthed NPC. Maybe Microsoft can add a casual cursing module to its Copilot gaming companion to really capture the feeling of hanging out with a dorm room buddy over a late-night gaming session.", "source": {"uri": "arstechnica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ars Technica"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_orland@arstechnica.com", "name": "Kyle Orland", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_demo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Game demo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameFAQs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "GameFAQs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-player_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-player video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zombie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sword"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_guide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strategy guide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitch (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Text file"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_Johansson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scarlett Johansson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Puzzle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Puzzle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Word_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Word Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Educational", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/zombie-760x380.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

For digitally mature Singapore enterprises, this collaboration will enable them to strengthen their capabilities in GenAI and to develop and deploy customized GenAI solutions, with more than 200 digitally mature Singapore SMEs to benefit over the next two years as a start. Microsoft and IMDA will also uplift tech providers in enabling their solutions with AI capabilities that would help scale AI adoption amongst SMEs.\n\nBoth the MOU and MOI were signed with the partners in the presence of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry, Mr. Gan Kim Yong.\n\nMicrosoft and LinkedIn's 2024 Work Trend Index revealed that knowledge workers in Singapore are ahead of their global peers when it comes to the use of AI, with close to nine in 10 (88%) in Singapore already using AI at work, compared to 75% globally. While 83% of Singaporean leaders believe their company needs to adopt AI to stay competitive, 68% of leaders worry their organization's leadership lacks a plan and vision to implement it.\n\n\"Against this backdrop, Microsoft is committed to supporting organizations of all sizes to drive transformation with AI through the AI Pinnacle Program. We are excited to be collaborating with Enterprise Singapore, AI Singapore, and IMDA, to expand the program's focus on enabling SMEs of varying levels of digital maturity to adopt and embrace AI technology to achieve productivity gains and tangible business impact,\" said Ms. Lee Hui Li, Managing Director, Microsoft Singapore. \"In doing so, we want to create an ecosystem where leaders are empowered to develop an AI strategy and roadmap for their organization, and employees are equipped with the skills, tools, and technology to thrive in the era of AI.\"\n\nAccelerating AI transformation for SMEs with EnterpriseSG and AISG\n\nJointly administered by Microsoft, EnterpriseSG and AISG, the Microsoft Copilot for SMEs program will support SMEs to deepen their AI capabilities by accelerating the adoption of Microsoft Copilot across key business functions such as HR, finance, sales, and marketing. As an everyday AI companion for work, Microsoft Copilot helps to streamline processes, enhances productivity, and enables employees to focus on higher-value tasks - ultimately driving greater efficiency and better business outcomes for SMEs, which are often faced with limited IT and corporate resources.\n\nThrough the program, EnterpriseSG will defray 50% of the Microsoft Copilot license costs for eligible businesses for a 12-month usage period to support their adoption of the solution. Beyond catalyzing the adoption of this AI-powered productivity tool, the program will also leverage Microsoft's partner ecosystem to provide additional training support and resources for SMEs to implement Copilot across different business processes effectively. In addition, Microsoft and EnterpriseSG will work with AISG to support capability building and educate SMEs on responsible AI use beyond Microsoft Copilot. More information can be found at: https://go.gov.sg/microsoft-copilot\n\n\"AI technologies can help many resource-strapped SMEs to do more with less. This is why Enterprise Singapore continues to expand our range of resources, including the rollout of the latest Microsoft Copilot for SMEs program, to help more local firms acquire new AI capabilities to enhance productivity and boost business outcomes. We will continue partnering with partners like Microsoft, to spur AI adoption and development among SMEs so that they can uplift competitiveness and better scale up their businesses,\" said Mr. Soh Leng Wan, Assistant Managing Director (Manufacturing), Enterprise Singapore.\n\nEmpowering both enterprises and tech providers leverage generative AI\n\nMicrosoft's collaboration with IMDA will uplift the AI capabilities of digitally mature local enterprises in Singapore. As part of IMDA's GenAI x Digital Leaders initiative, Microsoft will conduct technology discovery workshops and provide tech advisory that will cater to specific business needs of enterprises. IMDA will provide funding support to eligible enterprises to develop and deploy their GenAI solutions. Companies can also access Microsoft's network of tech partners and tools such as Azure OpenAI and Copilot, as well as get tech advice during the project implementation phase.\n\nTo accelerate the adoption of AI among local SMEs, Microsoft and IMDA will support the tech vendors under IMDA's SMEs Go Digital programme to integrate their solutions with AI capabilities. This will enable SMEs access to more AI solutions to boost productivity across business functions, foster product and service innovation, and deliver superior customer experiences.\n\n\"Aligned with Singapore's National AI Strategy 2.0, IMDA is excited to continue working with technology giants such as Microsoft to enable our local enterprises and ICT sector level up with AI. This partnership with Microsoft will look to enhance the pre-approved solutions under the SMEs Go Digital programme with GenAI to help scale the adoption of GenAI among SMEs. For our more digitally mature Singapore enterprises, this partnership will help them to navigate the complexities of GenAI and deepen their in-house digital capabilities, so as to develop new and exciting products and services, and be more competitive in the global market,\" said Mr Leong Der Yao, Assistant Chief Executive, Sectoral Transformation Group, IMDA.\n\nThe latest announcement builds on MOUs that Microsoft recently signed with SkillsFuture Singapore and NTUC LearningHub to equip SMEs with the skills and expertise needed to harness AI solutions, enabling them to transform and seize new opportunities. Microsoft's collaboration with SkillsFuture Singapore will benefit 2,000 SMEs over three years, while the collaboration with NTUC LearningHub will train up to 100,000 of its members in AI skills to enhance their AI literacy.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft has partnered IMDA to equip tech professionals with AI skills through the Information & Communications (I&C) Jobs Transformation Map (JTM) Training Partners to build the tech workforce's capabilities to develop and deploy AI-enabled digital solutions. Under the collaboration, IMDA's Training Partner NTUC LearningHub offers Microsoft certification courses in Azure AI.

Copilot in Microsoft 365 provides suggested prompts for better productivity. Outlook updates include managing document permissions on iPhone, Copilot generating themes, and a new split view for calendars.\n\nThere will be many exciting announcements regarding Windows on Arm this week, including the unveiling of Snapdragon X Elite-powered Surface Laptop 6 and Surface Pro 10. However, it was business as usual last week for Microsoft, with the release of new Windows Insider builds, and telling users well in advance what new features it's working on for Microsoft 365 through the roadmap website. And like every week, we'll explain all of that in detail, so that you get a comprehensive idea about what they are and how they'll boost your productivity, without even getting your hands on them.\n\n4 Microsoft Teams: new 'Shared' tab and closed captioning support for Teams Walkie Talkie\n\nClose\n\nMicrosoft announced only two new Teams features on the roadmap page last week: renaming the Files tab to \"Shared\" in chats (Feature ID: 396169), and closed captioning support in Teams Walkie Talkie (Feature ID: 396558).\n\nThe upcoming Shared tab will serve the same purpose as the Files tab, which acts as a place where users can find all the files and links shared in chats. However, this won't impact Teams Channels.\n\nMoreover, for those who use their iPhone as a walkie talkie using Teams, Microsoft plans to bring close captioning support to the Teams Walkie Talkie home screen. When available next month, you'll get a real-time translation of all the spoken words during the broadcast session on your iPhone.\n\n3 Copilot for Microsoft 365: suggested prompts and recommendations on where to share forms\n\nSource: Microsoft\n\nSuggested prompts for mobile users\n\nCopilot in Microsoft 365 can boost your productivity manifold only if you know how to use the right prompt to be able to generate quality answers from the chatbot. For those who struggle with writing the right prompts, Copilot suggests some relevant ones that you can use to get the perfect response. By the end of this month, suggested prompts will also be available on Microsoft 365 Android and iOS clients (Feature ID: 396557).\n\nRelated 5 Copilot features to up your Microsoft 365 game Copilot's advantage over other AI chatbots is integration with Microsoft 365 apps, and these five tips and tricks are must-know tools.\n\nCopilot shows the way to collect more responses to surveys and quizzes\n\nCopilot in Forms will become a lot more useful in the coming months. We already know that the AI assistant will be able to generate quizzes from documents, notes, and textbooks next month. In addition to that, it'll also recommend where you can share those forms to collect more responses to your surveys or quizzes (Feature ID: 392844). The recommendations will come in the form of suggesting emails, social media, and QR codes with links to your forms. This will be available before the end of this month.\n\n2 Microsoft Outlook: view multiple calendars at the same time, new way to create themes, and more\n\nAllowing iPhone users to manage document permissions\n\nOutlook will get a bunch of new features in the next couple of months. One of the noteworthy changes coming to Outlook users on iOS is the ability to manage document permissions. When available next month, iPhone users will get a notification from Outlook, asking them to update the permissions for recipients to be able to access the document files they're trying to send over email (Feature ID: 108887).\n\nCopilot will generate your Outlook themes\n\nCopilot in Outlook can help you be more productive in many ways. But from July this year, Copilot will also be able to generate new themes for Outlook on your Android and iPhone devices (Feature ID: 394682). If you're using Outlook on an Android or iPhone, you'll find those themes in Outlook Settings.\n\nRelated These 5 programs are way better than Microsoft Outlook Ditch the new cumbersome Outlook app for one of these alternatives\n\nView multiple calendars at the same time\n\nThe new Outlook for Windows will replace the classic Outlook in the coming years. But before that happens, Microsoft is in the process of adding all the useful classic Outlook to the new web-based Outlook experience. Calendar Split view is one such capability that's coming to the new Outlook for Windows this June (Feature ID: 396727).\n\nThe \"Split View\" will be a new option in Outlook for Windows and the web to display multiple calendars at the same time side-by-side. This is already available in the classic Outlook and Outlook for Mac.\n\nRevamped Profile Cards in Outlook\n\nProfile cards in Outlook are useful, as they give you certain information about your colleagues, including working hours, upcoming events you both have in common, notifications, and many more. However, the caveat is that users can only see one insight or notification on the profile cards in Outlook for Windows. Luckily, though, this limitation will go away by the end of this month.\n\nMicrosoft will introduce a \"Show All\" button on profile cards in the new Outlook and Outlook for the web. Clicking the button will display multiple insights and notifications on profile cards (Feature ID: 395789).\n\n1 OneNote: Copilot chat for iPads\n\nOneNote is part of Microsoft 365 suit and is available across platforms, including iOS and iPadOS. However, OneNote for iPads is currently missing one important AI feature: Copilot. This is going to change in December when Microsoft brings Copilot chat in OneNote for iPad devices, allowing users to use simple commands to understand, summarize, and rewrite notes, and more (Feature ID: 395787).\n\nTake release timelines with a grain of salt\n\nMicrosoft is more committed to announcing new capabilities for Microsoft 365 on the roadmap website as compared to launching them in the month it's originally planned. Simply put, instead of making all of them available in the next couple of months, Microsoft might delay some of them to a later month.", "source": {"uri": "xda-developers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "XDA-Developers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rahul_naskar@xda-developers.com", "name": "Rahul Naskar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_365", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft 365"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_captioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Closed captioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Outlook", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Outlook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Calendar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windows Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Teams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Teams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accessibility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Groupware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Groupware", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office_Suites", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office Suites", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/09/cancel-microsoft-365.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

The label mandates a set of minimum hardware specifications for running in-built AI features.\n\nOther major laptop makers like Dell, Acer, Asus and Lenovo have also announced their own 'Copilot + PC' devices this week, all of them running on the new Snapdragon X chip.\n\nWe'll need to thoroughly test the new devices before we can speak to Microsoft's bold performance claims.

Nasuni will use a co-pilot in its AIOps facilities.\n\nI talked with three Nasuni execs at a London, UK, Nasuni user group meeting. They were chief evangelist Russ Kennedy, chief innovation officer for data intelligence and AI, Jim Liddle, and Asim Zaheer, the chief marketing officer. The background is that Nasuni's File Data Platform provides file access to distributed users from a central synchronized object storage-based cloud repository with added services including ransomware detection and recovery.\n\nNasuni wants to use AI to help with automatically analyzing, indexing, and tagging file data. In April it announced that customers could integrate their data stores and workflows with customized Microsoft Copilot assistants.\n\nBut would it go further? I suggested that, with large customer file data estates held in the Nasuni cloud, it could build its own Copilot chatbot facility to analyse them for responses to customer user inquiries and requests. It could also vectorize this stored data, and use its tagging facility to keep track of data which had been vectorized and data which had not.\n\nA NetApp exec has suggested that such vectorization and indexing could be carried out at the storage layer in the IT stack.\n\nLiddle disagreed with these ideas. In his view, developing a smart chatbot, like GPT-4, costs millions of dollars. It would be hugely expensive and, even if Nasuni were to develop its own chatbot, customers may well prefer not to use it. He said, and Kennedy and Zaheer agreed, that Nasuni customers getting aboard the Gen AI train were using Microsoft's Copilot because it's already working across Microsoft 365 components, Windows 10 and 11, and Outlook.\n\n\"Customers will only want to use one Copilot,\" Liddle said, and not have to change to a separate one for different system software environments. They'll want a single Gen AI chatbot lens through which to look into their data.\n\nCopilot uses Microsoft's Semantic Index, This, Microsoft says, \"sits on top of the Microsoft Graph, which interprets user queries to produce contextually relevant responses that help you to be more productive. It allows organizations to search through billions of vectors (mathematical representations of features or attributes) and return related results.\"\n\nThese Nasuni execs believe customers want a single Gen AI co-pilot facility, and that in Windows-land Microsoft's Copilot and Semantic Index are already effectively in-place and incumbent.\n\nMy thinking is that several things follow from this. First, Nasuni will not build its own Copilot-like chatbot. That game, for its Windows users, has already been won by Microsoft.\n\nSecond, Nasuni will not build its own vectorization facility and vector data store into its File Data Platform. Microsoft's Copilot uses vectors in the Semantic Index and wouldn't understand vectors provided by Nasuni from its own vector database. Kennedy observed that there is there is no industry-standard vector format.\n\nAgain, the vectorization and indexing game for Windows users has already been won - by Microsoft Copilot and its Semantic Index.\n\nNasuni's - and its customers' - best interests are served by making Nasuni-held data available to Copilot and Semantic Index.\n\nA third thought occurred from this as well. Nasuni has customers who use Nutanix HCI and Not Microsoft's Hyper-V server virtualization. It is most unlikely Nutanix will build its own chatbot, nor its own vectorizing and vector storage facilities - for the same reasons as Nasuni. That means Nutanix will have to support external chatbots - and that's what it's doing with its GPT-in-a-box offering.\n\nLiddle said Nasuni will use Gen AI large language models to refine and optimize its own infrastructure for its customers. It tracks every I/O, not the I/O content, and this provides the base data for an LLM to optimize, for example, data placement across a customer's File Data Platform deployment sites, and further optimize the overall efficiency and cost of that multi-site deployment.\n\nAll of the above leads me to think that running vectorization and vector indexing in an external storage filer or SAN - or object system - is a misplaced idea in Windows environments, and will not happen.", "source": {"uri": "blocksandfiles.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Blocks and Files"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_mellor@blocksandfiles.com", "name": "Chris Mellor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasuni", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nasuni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vector graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ransomware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GPT-4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_365", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft 365"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Windows 10"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NetApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stack (abstract data type)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "System software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Outlook", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Outlook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mathematics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutanix", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nutanix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-V", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyper-V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual private server"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://blocksandfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NASUNI-COPILOT-TEASEr.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9580715", "eventUri": "eng-9580715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 103, "relevance": 1}

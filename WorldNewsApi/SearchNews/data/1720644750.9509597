Meanwhile, Pakistan will be looking to rebound from their defeat to co-hosts and World Cup debutants USA by triumphing over their biggest rival in the sport.Speaking on Star Sports, Kaif remarked that while Virat is a threat to every team, he will need to moderate his aggression against Pakistan. Notably, in the last match against Ireland, Kohli stepped out of his crease to play a big shot but was dismissed for just one run off five balls.T20 World Cup 2024: Points Table | Schedule\"Forget Pakistan, Virat Kohli is a danger for every team. Any team that plays against him would not find it that easy to get him out. However, I feel he will have to tone down his aggression a little. He could score only one run off five balls in the last match, stepped down the wicket, got a top edge, and got out,\" he responded.Kaif noted that Kohli is in excellent form, entering the tournament after a remarkable IPL season with the bat for Royal Challengers Bengaluru, where he scored 741 runs in 15 innings at an average of 61.75 and a strike rate of 154.69, including a century and five fifties. Kohli registered his highest-ever strike rate in his IPL career and was exceptional against spinners, adopting a more aggressive approach against them.Kaif urged Kohli to aim for a strike rate of around 130, instead of 140-150, and to be patient, waiting for bad balls to capitalize on.\"Virat Kohli has form and is coming after playing exceptionally well in the IPL. He scored close to 700 runs. We saw the domination where he was attacking in the powerplay and hitting boundaries, playing slog sweeps, and hitting sixes against spin,\" Kaif said.\"He is able to play every shot but I feel he needs to tone down his strike rate slightly. Go at a strike rate of around 130 and do not run close to 140-150. His role will be to bat 15 to 20 overs and score 60-70 runs. 70 runs from Virat Kohli's bat will be a very good knock. Take a little time at the start, wait for the bad balls, and then play your shots,\" he added.Kaif also suggested that Virat Kohli could bat at number three, as it is his ideal position on a tricky surface.\"I feel he can probably play at No. 3 as well. He opened and I can understand that he will open tomorrow as well, but I feel No. 3 is Virat Kohli's right position on such a pitch where the ball is moving. He can play till the end, run in the middle overs, and punish the bad balls,\" he said.At number three in T20Is, Virat has scored 3,076 runs at an average of 53.96 and a strike rate of 135.26, with 32 half-centuries. His best score is 94*.(With ANI inputs)", "summary": "Former Indian cricketer Mohammed Kaif said that star batter Virat Kohli will have to tone down his strike rate during the high-octane ICC T20 World Cup clash against Pakistan taking place in New York on Sunday.", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/kohli-will-have-to-kaifs-strike-rate-advice-for-virat-ahead-of-pakistan-clash/articleshow/110822444.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-110822486/110822486.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:04:43", "author": "Toi Sports Desk", "authors": ["Toi Sports Desk"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "IN", "sentiment": -0.079}

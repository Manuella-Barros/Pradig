This includes an outlay of Rs 6,853 crore for the installation and commissioning of 1 GW of offshore wind energy projects (500 MW each off the coast of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu), and a grant of Rs 600 crore for the upgradation of two ports to meet logistics requirements for offshore wind energy projects.\n\nAn official release said that the VGF scheme is a major step towards implementation of the National Offshore Wind Energy Policy notified in 2015 with an aim to exploit the vast offshore wind energy potential that exists within the exclusive economic zone of India. The VGF support from the Government will reduce the cost of power from offshore wind projects and make them viable for purchase by DISCOMs.\n\nWhile the projects will be established by private developers selected though a transparent bidding process, the power excavation infrastructure, including the offshore substations, will be constructed by Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd (PGCIL). Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, as the nodal ministry, will coordinate with various ministries and departments to ensure the successful implementation of the scheme.\n\nBriefing reporters on the decisions of the union cabinet, Information and Broadcasting Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said renewable energy is a big opportunity for India. \"Union Cabinet has taken a landmark decision by approving India's first offshore wind energy project. These will be 1GW offshore wind projects, 500 MW each (off the coast of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu). This is a big opportunity for India.\"\n\nThe release said the construction of offshore wind energy projects and its operations also require specific port infrastructure, which can handle storage and movement of heavy and large dimension equipment. Under the scheme, two ports in the country will be supported by Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways to meet the requirements of offshore wind development.\n\nOffshore wind is a source of renewable energy which offers several advantages over onshore wind and solar projects, such as higher adequacy and reliability, lower storage requirement and higher employment potential, the release said. Development of the offshore wind sector will lead to economy-wide benefits by attracting investments, development of indigenous manufacturing capabilities, creation of employment opportunities across the value chain and technology development for offshore wind in the country.\n\nThis will also contribute towards achieving India's energy transition targets. The release said successful commissioning of 1 GW offshore wind projects will produce renewable electricity of about 3.72 billion units annually, which will result in annual reduction of 2.98 million ton of CO2 equivalent emission for a period of 25 years.\n\n\"This scheme will not only kickstart the offshore wind energy development in India but also lead to the creation of a required ecosystem in the country to supplement its ocean-based economic activities. This ecosystem will support the development of an initial 37 GW of offshore wind energy at an investment of about Rs.4,50,000 crore,\" the release said.

To meet the 500GW target, India requires an annual capacity addition of around 44GW.\n\nMoody's estimates that the total investment needed to add the necessary 310GW of additional renewable energy capacity over the next seven years will be $190 billion to $215 billion, or $32 billion to $36 billion annually.", "source": {"uri": "fortuneindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FortuneIndia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Offshore wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Grid_Corporation_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Power Grid Corporation of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Council_of_Ministers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union Council of Ministers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public\u2013private_partnership", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public\u2013private partnership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_economic_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exclusive economic zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_New_and_Renewable_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of New and Renewable Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_substation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrical substation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_potential", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Global warming potential"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples of the Americas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Offshore_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Offshore Services", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/fortuneindia/2024-06/4b531db7-aec0-48cf-9987-014cdfc3956a/wind_energy.jpg?w=700", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663318", "eventUri": "eng-9663318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 231, "relevance": 1}

This initiative involves a total outlay of Rs. 7453 crore, earmarked for the development of 1 GW of offshore wind energy capacity and the enhancement of port infrastructure to support these projects.\n\nThe approved VGF scheme allocates Rs. 6853 crore for the installation and commissioning of two offshore wind energy projects, each with a capacity of 500 MW, off the coasts of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. Additionally, Rs. 600 crore has been set aside for upgrading two ports to facilitate the logistics necessary for these projects.\n\nThis initiative aligns with the National Offshore Wind Energy Policy, introduced in 2015, aimed at harnessing the extensive offshore wind energy potential within India's exclusive economic zone. By providing VGF support, the government aims to lower the cost of power generated from offshore wind projects, making it more viable for distribution companies (DISCOMs) to purchase.\n\nThe development of these projects will be undertaken by private developers selected through a transparent bidding process. The Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd (PGCIL) will be responsible for constructing the power evacuation infrastructure, including offshore substations. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, designated as the nodal ministry, will coordinate with various government departments to ensure the smooth implementation of the scheme.\n\nTo support the construction and operational needs of offshore wind energy projects, specific port infrastructure capable of handling large and heavy equipment is essential. The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways will upgrade two ports to meet these requirements, thereby facilitating the development of offshore wind energy.\n\nOffshore wind energy offers several advantages over onshore wind and solar projects, including higher reliability, lower storage needs, and greater employment potential. The growth of this sector is expected to attract significant investments, foster the development of indigenous manufacturing capabilities, and create numerous job opportunities across the value chain. Furthermore, it will contribute to technology development in the offshore wind sector, aiding India in achieving its energy transition targets.\n\nThe commissioning of 1 GW of offshore wind projects is projected to generate approximately 3.72 billion units of renewable electricity annually.

Under the VGF scheme, the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways (MoPS&W) will support the development of two ports to meet these requirements.\n\nMany Advantages\n\nOffshore wind energy harnesses the power of winds over the open seas, providing a clean and renewable energy source.\n\nThe benefits of offshore wind energy are numerous. It eliminates the limitations posed by land availability, boasting a higher capacity utilisation factor nearing 50 per cent. Additionally, offshore wind turbines are more efficient than their onshore counterparts.\n\nIndia, with its 7,600 km coastline and favorable geographical conditions, has significant potential for offshore wind energy development. However, despite these advantages and a strong policy framework, the sector has yet to achieve its potential, with no offshore wind projects currently established in the country.\n\nIndia has positioned itself as a champion for renewable energy -- its 2030 targets as articulated in its formal, nationally-determined contributions speak of tripling renewable energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030.\n\nThe recent Cabinet approval marks a strategic move to boost India's offshore wind energy sector, setting the stage for a major advance in the country's green energy goals.\n\nThe successful commissioning of 1 GW of offshore wind projects is expected to generate approximately 3.72 billion units of renewable electricity annually, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 2.98 million tons annually for 25 years.\n\nMoreover, this initiative will not only kick-start offshore wind energy development in India but also create a supportive ecosystem for ocean-based economic activities.

This comprehensive funding package earmarks Rs 6,853 crore specifically for installing and commissioning 1 gigawatt (GW) of offshore wind energy capacity. These installations, strategically located off the coasts of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, are set to maximise the potential of these regions for renewable energy production.\n\nThis allocation includes a crucial Rs 600 crore grant for upgrading two ports. These enhancements are essential to meet the logistical demands associated with offshore wind energy ventures. Earlier reports indicated that the bidding process for this 1 GW capacity could commence within the first 100 days of the new government's term.\n\nThe VGF scheme aligns with the National Offshore Wind Energy Policy introduced in 2015, aiming to fully harness the vast potential within India's exclusive economic zone.\n\nOnce operational, these offshore projects are expected to generate approximately 3.72 billion units of renewable electricity annually.\n\nMoreover, they will establish a supportive ecosystem conducive to expanding ocean-based economic activities across the region.\n\nThe government envisions this initiative as a catalyst for further development, with plans to scale up to 37 GW of offshore wind energy. Such an ambitious expansion will require an estimated investment of Rs 4,50,000 crore.\n\nThis scale of investment underscores the strategic importance and long-term economic viability anticipated from offshore wind energy projects.\n\nFinancial support from the VGF scheme is anticipated to significantly reduce the cost of offshore wind power, rendering it financially viable for procurement by power distribution companies. To execute the projects, private developers will be selected through a competitive bidding process. At the same time, the critical transmission infrastructure, including offshore substations, will be overseen by the state-owned Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd.\n\nCoordination efforts led by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy will ensure seamless implementation of the scheme, involving collaboration with various ministries and departments. The construction and operation of offshore wind projects necessitate specialised port infrastructure to handle heavy equipment efficiently. Accordingly, the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways will support the development of these capabilities at two designated ports under the scheme.\n\nAdvantages highlighted by the government include the superior reliability and adequacy of offshore wind energy compared to onshore wind and solar projects. Additionally, offshore wind energy projects are not only expected to significantly contribute to India's renewable energy goals, but also to create a substantial number of local employment opportunities, fostering economic growth and sustainability.", "source": {"uri": "electronicsb2b.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ElectronicsB2B"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shahana_mukherjee@electronicsb2b.com", "name": "Shahana Mukherjee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Council_of_Ministers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union Council of Ministers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Offshore wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public\u2013private_partnership", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public\u2013private partnership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_economic_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exclusive economic zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procurement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Procurement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State-owned enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Grid_Corporation_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Power Grid Corporation of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_New_and_Renewable_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of New and Renewable Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_distribution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric power distribution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric power transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_substation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electrical substation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Offshore_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Offshore Services", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.electronicsb2b.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cznmcy1wcml2yxrll3jhd3bpegvsx2ltywdlcy93zwjzaxrlx2nvbnrlbnqvbhivcgqxos0zltm5odyyys5qcgc.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663318", "eventUri": "eng-9663318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

While the projects will be established by private developers selected through a transparent bidding process, the power excavation infrastructure, including offshore substations, will be constructed by Power Grid Corporation of India (PGCIL).\n\nThe Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, as the nodal ministry, will coordinate with various Ministries/ Departments to ensure successful implementation of the scheme.\n\nConstruction of offshore wind energy projects and its operations also require specific port infrastructure, which can handle storage and movement of heavy and large dimension equipment. Under the scheme, two ports in the country will be supported by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways to meet the requirements of offshore wind development.\n\nOffshore wind is a source of renewable energy which offers several advantages over onshore wind and solar projects, such as higher adequacy & reliability, lower storage requirement and higher employment potential.\n\nDevelopment of offshore wind sector will lead to economy-wide benefits by attracting investments, development of indigenous manufacturing capabilities, creation of employment opportunities across the value chain and technology development for offshore wind in the country. This will also contribute towards achieving India's energy transition targets.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on June 19, 2024", "source": {"uri": "thehindubusinessline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "@businessline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Offshore wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_potential", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Global warming potential"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public\u2013private_partnership", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public\u2013private partnership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Grid_Corporation_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Power Grid Corporation of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_economic_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exclusive economic zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_New_and_Renewable_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of New and Renewable Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_substation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electrical substation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples of the Americas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Offshore_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Offshore Services", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/58c7fk/article68308930.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_FILE_PHOTO__A_survey_2_1_ETCUK272.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663318", "eventUri": "eng-9663318", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 2964, "textEnd": 2971}], "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

There is no doubt our sector has had a bumpy couple of years. The jarring effect of inflation on supply chains around the world has disrupted market prices, risk profiles and attitudes to the sector unlike anything we have seen before in the industry's development. Yet the market is turning the corner. According to our new EnergyPulse report, the sector added 21% to its global installed capacity in the last year alone.\n\n\"In the UK, we can look ahead to a positive auction for new offshore wind projects in 2024, with nearly 11 gigawatts of capacity eligible to bid in, including a healthy mix of established fixed-bottom projects as well as innovative floating wind projects.\n\n\"We have spent much of the last year developing our offshore wind Industrial Growth Plan. Economic growth has been put at the heart of this election and many others around the world. After the UK election, the Secretary of State will arrive at a very early decision about how much offshore wind to procure this year. With the right backing, nearly \u00a330 billion of private investment into renewables, across all technologies, can be secured this autumn, with an industrial plan to stimulate the jobs and careers across Britain, kickstarting economic growth and industrial reinvention\".\n\nThe Offshore Wind Industry Council (OWIC)'s latest report, produced by Aeos and Deloitte, looks at the challenges of the consenting process for offshore wind projects in the UK.\n\nIt found that recent planning system reforms had only reduced the time it takes to consent an offshore wind farm \"by a matter of months\", and that new legislation might not significantly reduce those times. Instead, it suggests a programme of initiatives would have to be co-ordinated and driven by the Cabinet Office and Number 10 Policy Unit to be successful, across government departments and devolved administrations.\n\nThe report, \"Policy and Legislative Barriers to Consenting Offshore Wind\", recommends four key measures:\n\nDeveloping and setting out an optimal long-term future energy mix for the UK.\n\nDeveloping a spatial plan for National Grid to deliver a long-term energy mix aligning with estimates of future electricity generation.\n\nDelivering well-resourced marine spatial planning to underpin and support seabed leasing.\n\nAligning the financial support mechanisms with the pipeline of future projects, to provide greater certainty to all parties in the process.\n\nRenewableUK's Kat Route-Stephens, who leads the Environment and Consents programme for OWIC, said: \"Implementing the four key measures set out in this report is vital to speed up the delivery of the UK's world-class pipeline of offshore wind projects. By cutting through longstanding barriers we can stay on track to decarbonise our electricity system and maintain our position as a global leader in offshore wind\".\n\nRenewableUK's executive director of policy Ana Musat said: \"There is a strong cross-party consensus on the need to ramp up offshore wind development, so whoever wins the next election is going to have to focus on improving the planning system around it.\n\n\"That direction must come from the Cabinet Office and the Number 10 Policy Unit, bringing together all the relevant departments, stakeholders and devolved governments with industry.

Announcing what is being called the Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called it a major step toward implementing the vision for offshore and renewable energy.\n\nModi has ambitious plans to industrialize India and expand its role in global trade. Economic growth was the cornerstone of his recent reelection campaign. By 2030 he predicts India will nearly double its economy to more than $6.6 trillion. His goal is to be a developed economy by 2047 but to achieve that requires massive infrastructure investments such as an expanded power supply.\n\nThe cabinet agreed to invest a total of approximately $891 million to start the development of the offshore wind energy sector. It is a key step to implement the National Offshore Wind Energy Policy first put forth in 2015. The VGF that was approved calls for support from the government to reduce the cost of power from offshore wind projects. This will make the electricity generated viable for purchase by the country's Distribution Companies (DISCOMs).\n\n\"This scheme will not only kick start the offshore wind energy development in India but also lead to the creation of a required ecosystem in the country to supplement its ocean-based economic activities,\" the government said announcing the agreement to proceed with offshore wind energy.\n\nThe plan calls for two wind farms each with a capacity of approximately 500 MW to be developed. One will be located in the Gujarat state on India's west coast in the Arabian Sea. It will provide power in the region in the north of Mumbai, the country's largest city as well as its financial hub as well as the locus for the tech and movie industries. The second wind farm will be in the Bay of Bengal near the southeastern tip of the peninsular. It will be in the Tamil Nadu state which spans from the city of Chennai in the north to the channel separating India and Sri Lanka. Development of these wind farms they said would reduce CO2 emissions by 2.98 million tons over a period of 25 years.\n\nThe government will provide approximately $819 million for the development of these two wind farms. Details were not announced on how they plan to structure a subsidy program for the offshore wind sector. Also, no target date was released for the wind farms to be built and operational.\n\nThe Ministry of New and Renewable Energy will be charged with overseeing the development of the offshore wind sector and coordinating the efforts of the different ministries. They plan to run a bidding process to select private developers responsible for building the offshore wind farms. The Power Grid Corporation of India, however, will be responsible for the offshore substations and the interconnects to the country's power grid.\n\nThe cabinet also recognized the need to upgrade ports to handle the staging and assembly required for offshore wind farms. They allocated approximately $71 million for the upgrade of ports in the first two states selected for wind farms. The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways will be responsible for managing the port projects.\n\nThe master plan for India's offshore wind industry sets a target of 37 GW of offshore wind energy capacity. A total investment of more than $53 billion in targets for the development of the offshore wind energy sector.", "source": {"uri": "maritime-executive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Maritime

He said he would put a strong focus on strategic investment, robust supply chains and developing skills to ensure that Wales is excellently placed to lead the charge towards a green energy future.\n\nThis work will start by developing and enhancing offshore capability at the strategically placed ports of Holyhead, Mostyn, Pembrokeshire, and Port Talbot, which have each had a pivotal role to play in Wales's offshore wind successes to date.\n\nJeremy Miles said:\n\n\"Wales was at the forefront of one industrial revolution, and now we have the tools, the expertise and the ambition to be at the forefront of the next.\n\n\"Offshore wind is not just an energy solution; our ports are gateways to economic growth and environmental sustainability. I'm proud of the part Wales has played in leading on offshore wind energy production so far, and I'm committed to maximising the benefits to Wales by driving high-value investment in manufacturing, infrastructure and skills as we look to develop and support further projects at key sites.\n\n\"As a Government, work will soon begin with our ports to develop a clear offshore strategy, ensuring the industry has the certainty it needs, and businesses in the supply chain can be best positioned to meet demand. We want to move quickly with this, working with the industry, experts and local communities to get the very best from an industry with huge potential, not just for Wales but globally.\"\n\nThe Welsh Government said its Net Zero Skills Plan was crucial to achieving a net-zero Wales.\n\nJeremy Miles added:\n\n\"Skills are critical to improving productivity and delivering on the economic opportunities from our transition to a net-zero Wales. I want to ensure there's an emphasis from Government to work with the industry, trade unions, and education organisations to enhance our skills offer, and develop bespoke educational and training initiatives tailored to an offshore wind industry we know provides so many truly prosperous and sustainable opportunities.\"\n\nIt comes as a report published by Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) says that government decisions following next month's General Election offer the opportunity to focus on a 'homegrown energy transition' which could secure the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of highly skilled people.\n\nPeople currently employed in offshore oil and gas, wind and hydrogen energy production or carbon capture projects have highly transferable skills that are crucial to securing the UK's target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, it says.\n\nThe report says the UK energy sector holds the key to achieving a homegrown net zero economy that will be a blueprint for the

Under the scheme, two ports in the country will be supported by Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways to meet the requirements of offshore wind development.\n\nOffshore wind is a source of renewable energy which offers several advantages over onshore wind and solar projects, such as higher adequacy and reliability, lower storage requirement and higher employment potential.\n\nDevelopment of offshore wind sector will lead to economy-wide benefits by attracting investments, development of indigenous manufacturing capabilities, creation of employment opportunities across the value chain and technology development for offshore wind in the country. This will also contribute towards achieving India's energy transition targets.\n\nThe successful commissioning of 1 GW offshore wind projects will produce renewable electricity of about 3.72 billion units annually, which will result in annual reduction of 2.98 million ton of CO2 equivalent emission for a period of 25 years.\n\nFurther, this scheme will not only kick start the offshore wind energy development in India but also lead to creation of required ecosystem in the country to supplement its ocean based economic activities. This ecosystem will support the development of initial 37 GW of offshore wind energy at an investment of about Rs 4,50,000 crore.\n\nUNI SKB ING", "source": {"uri": "uniindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "http://www.uniindia.com/fadnavis-orders-probe-into-mumbai-pub-fire/states/news/1090400.html"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Offshore wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Grid_Corporation_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Power Grid Corporation of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Council_of_Ministers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union Council of Ministers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public\u2013private_partnership", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public\u2013private partnership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_New_and_Renewable_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of New and Renewable Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_economic_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exclusive economic zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_substation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrical substation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Ports,_Shipping_and_Waterways", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Offshore_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Offshore Services", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.uniindia.com/cms/gall_content/2024/6/2024_6$largeimg19_Jun_2024_203425590.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663318", "eventUri": "eng-9663318", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 18}], "sentiment": 0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

This will be equally distributed between two projects, each with a capacity of 500 MW, situated off the coasts of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.\n\nAn additional Rs. 600 crore has been allocated for the upgradation of two key ports. These upgrades are crucial to meeting the logistics and infrastructural needs associated with the offshore wind energy projects, ensuring smooth operations and maintenance.\n\nGujarat and Tamil Nadu, both coastal states with significant wind potential, have been strategically chosen for these projects. The installation of wind energy turbines off their shores is expected to harness substantial wind power, contributing to the national grid and supporting the regions' energy needs.\n\nThe approval of this scheme is a major step towards achieving India's renewable energy targets.

Amidst this urgent call to action, one resource stands out as pivotal in accelerating our clean energy transition: offshore wind power. The Global Offshore Wind Report 2024 from the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) heralds a transformative moment, emphasizing that offshore wind is no longer confined to regional success stories but is poised for unprecedented global growth.\n\nThe figures speak volumes. In 2023 alone, offshore wind industry added 11 GW of capacity to the grid, marking a remarkable 24 percent year-on-year increase. This surge underscores not just numerical growth but a concerted global effort involving governments, industries, institutions and civil society to drive momentum toward a carbon-free future. Crucially, over 20 nations have joined the Global Offshore Wind Alliance (GOWA), committing to ambitious targets of installing 380 GW by 2030 and an astounding 2,000 GW by 2050.\n\nFor South Korea, a nation known for its strong industrial capabilities and technological innovation, the emergence of offshore wind represents a golden opportunity. With coastlines on three sides and benefiting from favorable wind conditions at sea, South Korea's robust maritime and engineering sectors make it ideally positioned for offshore wind development.\n\nKorea possesses most of the ingredients to establish itself as a potential leader in this burgeoning industry. Leveraging existing strengths in shipbuilding, steel, plant engineering and cable industries, Korea can not only meet increasing domestic electricity demand sustainably but also position itself as a formidable player in the supply chain for the global offshore wind market.\n\nThe parallels are striking when we consider Korea's history of swift adaptation and mastery in emerging industries. From semiconductor manufacturing to advanced electronics, Korea has consistently demonstrated its ability to pioneer new technologies and scale them to global prominence. Now, with offshore wind, Korea stands at the precipice of another industrial revolution.\n\nImagine Korean companies leading the charge in designing, constructing and operating state-of-the-art offshore wind turbines and platforms. Picture Korean-made components powering wind farms across the seas, from the North and Baltic Seas to the coasts of the Asia-Pacific and Latin America. This vision isn't just aspirational, it's within reach. Already, international and domestic firms are eyeing Korea as a strategic hub for manufacturing facilities, poised to create jobs, revitalize local economies and bolster the nation's export capabilities.\n\nThe economic benefits are manifold. By embracing offshore wind, Korea can stimulate industrial growth, attract foreign investment, and enhance its global competitiveness in renewable energy technology. Moreover, as global corporations increasingly commit to sourcing renewable electricity under the global RE100 initiative, Korean-made offshore wind power presents a compelling solution for the major industrial electricity consumers in Korea, including Samsung, SK and LG.\n\nGovernment support, not merely as an energy policy but as a strategic industrial policy, is pivotal in realizing this vision. Policies that streamline regulatory processes, provide financial incentives and foster R&D are essential. Regular dialogues between industry and policymakers will be instrumental in the unique challenges of offshore wind deployment.\n\nThe urgency of climate action cannot be overstated. The window of opportunity to mitigate catastrophic climate change is narrowing, demanding decisive and concerted efforts. Embracing offshore wind isn't just about meeting energy targets; it's about safeguarding our planet for current and future generations, fostering sustainable development and securing a resilient future.\n\nSouth Korea, the time is now. Let us harness our ingenuity, industrial might and unwavering commitment to sustainability to propel ourselves to the forefront of the offshore wind revolution. By doing so, we can pave the way for a prosperous, sustainable and just future -- one where Korea leads as a global hub for offshore wind innovation, excellence and leadership.\n\nThe journey ahead is challenging, but the rewards are immeasurable. Together, let us seize this historic opportunity to shape a cleaner, brighter and more sustainable world through offshore wind.\n\nFrom Nov. 23 to 26 to 28, the APAC Wind Energy Summit 2004 will be held in Songdo, Incheon, where policymakers from across the APAC region and industry leaders around the world will join.

The policy aims to exploit the vast offshore wind energy potential within India's exclusive economic zone. Under the scheme, private developers, selected through a transparent bidding process, will establish the projects while the Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd (PGCIL) will construct the power excavation infrastructure, including offshore substations. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy will coordinate with various Ministries and Departments to ensure successful implementation of the scheme.\n\n\"Construction of offshore wind energy projects and its operations also require specific port infrastructure, which can handle storage and movement of heavy and large dimension equipment. Under the scheme, two ports in the country will be supported by Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways to meet the requirements of offshore wind development,\" the statement said.\n\nThe commissioning of 1 GW offshore wind projects, upon successful completion, is expected to generate approximately 3.72 billion units of renewable electricity on an annual basis. This clean energy production will contribute to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, amounting to 2.98 million ton of CO2 equivalent per year, over a span of 25 years.\n\nMoreover, the implementation of this scheme will serve as a catalyst for the development of offshore wind energy in India.

Here are the upsides and downsides of wind power.\n\nAs a renewable energy source, offshore wind appears to be free. In reality, it is among the most expensive electricity options available, and the current plans to develop giant wind farms off the U.S. East Coast will dramatically increase the already high cost of our power.\n\nCoastal states, like Rhode Island, are blessed with substantial offshore wind resources. These resources have attracted significant interest from offshore wind developers with encouragement and generous subsidies from federal, state and local governments.\n\nToday, Rhode Island's residential electricity costs nearly two and half times more than the U.S. average. Over the past decade, the state's electricity prices have risen 81 percent, two-and-a-half times the rate of increase of the average U.S. residential price. Why is it so expensive? Renewable energy and green mandates. Is it going to get more expensive? Yes, and offshore wind will be the primary driver.\n\nWe are told offshore wind is competitive with other energy sources, especially because the fuel is \"free.\" But with all energy sources, it costs money to get the power from where it is produced to your home. This is where the transmission and distribution expenses come into play. These expenses pay for high-tension wires, utility poles, transformers, substations, and meters that enable electricity to get from a power plant, solar panel, or wind turbine to the light switch. For offshore wind, there are also costs to erect the turbines and build the ocean-based substations, as well as lay the underwater cables that bring the power ashore. These facilities and equipment come with sizable construction and operational costs, including regular maintenance, repairs, replacement, and eventual decommissioning. Every dollar of these costs hides inconspicuously in the transmission and distribution charge paid by consumers.\n\nThe capital investment for offshore wind is nearly five times that of gas-fired electric generation, and the annual maintenance expense is likely to reach twice the current average, based on the government's data from BIW, the test turbines off the coast of Virginia and offshore wind projects in Europe. New England's Revolution Wind offshore project, rejected by Rhode Island Energy, would only secure about half of Rhode Island's current generating capacity while adding $3 billion to ratepayer electricity bills. The Public Utilities Commission and the Office of Energy Resources, both Rhode Island State government entities, agreed with that assessment. However, consider that, at this cost, the actual power delivery of the generating capacity is less than half because of the intermittency of wind. The actual cost of replacing Rhode Island's current generating capacity with offshore wind will be several times higher than the $3 billion.\n\nAnother challenge to wind energy, and another driver of higher costs, is the need for backup power. For offshore wind, backup energy is needed to ensure that the grid always meets consumer demand, even when Mother Nature fails to deliver the wind. Another power source must be ready to take over when the wind stops blowing, often at times of highest demand. That could be batteries -- but, in addition to being expensive and environmentally harmful, they could really only serve for about four hours. Fossil fuel power plants are currently the only suitable guarantee of electricity to meet consumer demand during these times. As a result, consumers must support a secondary utility system to offshore wind to ensure a dependable energy grid. In essence, offshore wind guarantees that ratepayers assume the cost of two independent generation systems.\n\nTo stimulate the creation of renewable energy, including wind energy, the federal and state governments are providing increasing levels of subsidies and incentives to encourage private investment. These taxpayer-supported subsidies take the form of tax credits and financing mechanisms such as tax-exempt bonds, loan guarantee programs, and low-interest loans. Our elected leaders may wish to ignore basic economics, but there is no denying that state and federal taxpayers will shoulder the cost of these financial benefits for developers.\n\nFor many states, especially coastal states that are planning to develop offshore wind, electricity is expensive and will become even more so. As renewables become a greater proportion of the electricity generation capacity, electricity costs rise -- as the experiments in Germany and California have shown. Increased energy costs have a significant negative effect on economic activity. And offshore wind is the most expensive of the renewables. Our government has already admitted that there is no evidence that offshore wind energy will make any measurable impact on climate change. Despite the high costs that we will all be forced to bear, not to mention the environmental, security and fishing impacts resulting from offshore wind, development is still planned. This is a bad deal by any measure for Rhode Island. Hold on to your wallet as the government and developers recklessly industrialize our coastal waters.", "source": {"uri": "mycentraljersey.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyCentralJersey.com"},

Amidst this urgent call to action, one resource stands out as pivotal in accelerating our clean energy transition: offshore wind power. The Global Offshore Wind Report 2024 from the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) heralds a transformative moment, emphasizing that offshore wind is no longer confined to regional success stories but is poised for unprecedented global growth.\n\nThe figures speak volumes. In 2023 alone, the global offshore wind industry added 11 GW of capacity to the grid, marking a remarkable 24 percent year-on-year increase. This surge underscores not just numerical growth but a concerted global effort involving governments, industries, institutions and civil society to drive momentum toward a carbon-free future. Crucially, over 20 nations have joined the Global Offshore Wind Alliance (GOWA), committing to ambitious targets of installing 380 GW by 2030 and an astounding 2,000 GW by 2050.\n\nFor South Korea, a nation known for its strong industrial capabilities and technological innovation, the emergence of offshore wind represents a golden opportunity. With coastlines on three sides and benefiting from favorable wind conditions at sea, South Korea's robust maritime and engineering sectors make it ideally positioned for offshore wind development.\n\nKorea possesses most of the ingredients to establish itself as a potential leader in this burgeoning industry. Leveraging existing strengths in shipbuilding, steel, plant engineering and cable industries, Korea can not only meet increasing domestic electricity demand sustainably but also position itself as a formidable player in the supply chain for the global offshore wind market.\n\nThe parallels are striking when we consider Korea's history of swift adaptation and mastery in emerging industries. From semiconductor manufacturing to advanced electronics, Korea has consistently demonstrated its ability to pioneer new technologies and scale them to global prominence. Now, with offshore wind, Korea stands at the precipice of another industrial revolution.\n\nImagine Korean companies leading the charge in designing, constructing and operating state-of-the-art offshore wind turbines and platforms. Picture Korean-made components powering wind farms across the seas, from the North and Baltic Seas to the coasts of the Asia-Pacific and Latin America. This vision isn't just aspirational; it's within reach. Already, international and domestic firms are eyeing Korea as a strategic hub for manufacturing facilities, poised to create jobs, revitalize local economies and bolster the nation's export capabilities.\n\nThe economic benefits are manifold. By embracing offshore wind, Korea can stimulate industrial growth, attract foreign investment and enhance its global competitiveness in renewable energy technology. Moreover, as global corporations increasingly commit to sourcing renewable electricity under the global RE100 initiative, Korean-made offshore wind power presents a compelling solution for the major industrial electricity consumers in Korea, including Samsung, SK and LG.\n\nGovernment support, not merely as an energy policy but as a strategic industrial policy, is pivotal in realizing this vision. Policies that streamline regulatory processes, provide financial incentives and foster R&D are essential. Regular dialogues between industry and policymakers will be instrumental in the unique challenges of offshore wind deployment.\n\nThe urgency of climate action cannot be overstated. The window of opportunity to mitigate catastrophic climate change is narrowing, demanding decisive and concerted efforts. Embracing offshore wind isn't just about meeting energy targets; it's about safeguarding our planet for current and future generations, fostering sustainable development and securing a resilient future.\n\nSouth Korea, the time is now. Let us harness our ingenuity, industrial might and unwavering commitment to sustainability to propel ourselves to the forefront of the offshore wind revolution. By doing so, we can pave the way for a prosperous, sustainable and just future -- one where Korea leads as a global hub for offshore wind innovation, excellence and leadership.\n\nThe journey ahead is challenging, but the rewards are immeasurable. Together, let us seize this historic opportunity to shape a cleaner, brighter and more sustainable world through offshore wind.\n\nFrom Nov. 26-28, the APAC Wind Energy Summit 2024 will be held in Songdo, Incheon, where policymakers from across the Asia-Pacific region and industry leaders around the world will join. The world will be watching to see how the Asia-Pacific region, includi\n\n(END)", "source": {"uri": "en.yna.co.kr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yonhap News Agency"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kim_han_joo@en.yna.co.kr", "name": "Kim Han-joo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Wind_Energy_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Global Wind Energy Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Offshore wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Loom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innovation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_farm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wind farm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltic Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipbuilding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shipbuilding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Industrial Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Latin America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LG Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incheon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incheon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Incheon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Offshore_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Offshore Services", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Globalization", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Globalization", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://r.yna.co.kr/global/home/v01/img/yonhapnews_logo_1200x800_en01.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663318", "eventUri": "eng-9663318", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-26", "dateEnd": "-11-28", "textStart": 4524, "textEnd": 4534}], "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

However, this depends greatly on the investment environment, national regulations, and permitting procedures, as well as the availability of a skilled workforce with experience in this industry,\" the Report said.\n\nIt noted that the region is often positioned as an ideal spot for solar due to its favourable weather conditions and geographical location while the region's equally significant wind potential, especially in Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Egypt, and Oman, tends to be overlooked. Offshore wind is also put at a disadvantage due to its larger investments and the readily available onshore locations.\n\nHowever, \"efforts to diversify energy sources, potential development of subsea interconnectors to Europe, and the potential of green energy/green product exports may encourage MENA countries to reconsider their original stance on offshore wind,\" the Report said.\n\nIn Morocco, the European Investment Bank (EIB) recently awarded the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN) a $2 billion grant to conduct a feasibility study for offshore wind in Morocco. The Report said the North African country's target of reaching 51 percent renewable energy by 203, and its desire to position itself as a regional green hydrogen hub and exporter of green electricity to Europe will further contribute to the case for offshore wind development. According to a previous GWEC study, Morocco's offshore potential is around 200 GW.\n\nIn the case of Saudi Arabia, GWEC has estimated offshore wind potential along the Kingdom's eastern and western coasts at a combined 106 GW. The Report said Saudi Arabia's ambitious renewable energy targets together with the launch of green hydrogen schemes and the potential to export of green products, including green hydrogen derivatives, are expected to as key drivers for development of both onshore and offshore wind. Currently, the kingdom has only one onshore wind farm in operation [the 400 megawatts (MW) Dumat al Jandal].\n\n(Editing by Anoop Menon) (anoop.menon@lseg.com)\n\nSubscribe to our Projects' PULSE newsletter that brings you trustworthy news, updates and insights on project activities, developments, and partnerships across sectors in the Middle East and Africa.", "source": {"uri": "zawya.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zawya.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Offshore wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Investment_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Investment Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MENA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MENA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oman"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Oman"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Offshore_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Offshore Services", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 15}], "image": "https://static.zawya.com/view/acePublic/alias/contentid/OWM5MzNjMzMtNDE5My00/0/180412182201drec-jpg.jpeg?f=3%3A2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663318", "eventUri": "eng-9663318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Or follow us on Google News!\n\nFirst it was Brooklyn. Now it's Staten Island. Two different New York City boroughs are set to host new hubs for offshore wind farms, and both are claiming to be among the largest in the US. The two new hubs are further evidence that that US offshore wind industry is already back on its feet, despite the interfering fingers of fossil energy stakeholders and a series of other stumbling blocks.\n\nStarting with the most recent news first, the new Staten Island offshore wind hub is called Arthur Kill Terminal. The project will sit on 32 acres on the west shore of Staten Island abutting the Arthur Kill, a waterway that separates the borough from New Jersey. Its planned 1-gigawatt capacity will reportedly make it the biggest privately-owned wind hub in the US.\n\nThe project comes under the umbrella of Atlantic Offshore Terminals, an infrastructure and industrial real estate development startup that launched in 2018. AOT describes its core business as focusing like a laser on the \"rapidly progressing US offshore wind industry.\"\n\nThat's an optimistic take, considering that the rapid progress almost evaporated just last year after a series of cancellations brought several offshore projects along the Atlantic coast to a screeching halt. Aside from the fossil energy interests at work, supply chain issues, inflation, and other nuts-and-bolts factors were in play. However, that was then. New York is back on its feet with new offshore projects, and neighboring New Jersey is among the other states resetting their offshore agenda as well.\n\nTemporary setback aside, anyone who pronounced the death of the US offshore wind industry last year was not following the money trail. In July of 2021, the alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management announced it nailed down an agreement for investing in the Arthur Kill Terminal. The A-list firm had about $461 billion of assets under management as of March 31, 2021.\n\n\"The Arthur Kill Terminal development aligns with Apollo's expertise in renewable energy infrastructure and with the Firm's longstanding commitment to strong environmental, social and governance principles,\" Apollo stated in a press release dated July 15, 2021.\n\nApollo also cited New York State's target of 9,000 megawatts' worth of offshore wind, part of a juicy East coast market that no investor would want to give up easily.\n\nIn the meantime, New York State's economic development agency, Empire State Development, was adding its muscle to the wind hub effort. In 2022 the agency announced that it won a $48 million grant from the federal Department of Transportation in support of the project.\n\nThe Arthur Kill Terminal \"represents an unparalleled opportunity to meet the urgent need for suitable offshore wind ports on the East Coast and will be an important asset for offshore wind as the only non-bridge restricted offshore wind staging and assembly port in New York State,\" ESD stated, referring to the problem of transporting massive wind turbine components under bridges that were not designed for such work.\n\nESD also emphasized that Arthur Kill Terminal will accommodate next-generation offshore wind technologies, including floating offshore wind turbines and foundations.\n\nThe floating turbine angle is interesting because offshore wind sites in New York State and practically the entire East Coast are suitable for conventional fixed-platform construction. The water is shallow enough to park wind turbines on monopiles pounded into the ocean bed, so there is no need for the more delicate engineering feat of situating turbines on a floating platform.\n\nEither AOT is already positioning itself in the supply chain for offshore wind sites in Maine that require floating wind technology, or the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is open to the idea of leasing offshore wind sites in deeper waters. Or...it could mean something else entirely.\n\nDetails on the project are a little thin at the moment. Apollo has not issued any new releases since the 2021 announcement, ESD has also been mum since 2022, and the project website for the Arthur Kill Terminal was still in the bare-bones stage as of this writing. If you can track anything else down, drop us a note in the comment thread.\n\nIn 2022, though, US Senator Chuck Schumer of New York did let word drop that the new wind hub would include a \"1365-foot-long wharf with adjacent laydown area that has enhanced load bearing capacity.\"\n\nAnother element consists of \"a tenant area consisting of a 15,266 square-foot combined warehouse and office building and a project owner's area consisting of a 4,200 square-foot office building.\"\n\nEarlier this week, AOT posted a brief announcement on LinkedIn indicating that the project is moving through the pipeline, the latest milestone being approval from the New York City Planning Commission for \"land use actions needed to facilitate the construction and operation of Arthur Kill Terminal.\"\n\nMeanwhile over in Brooklyn, the start of construction on the new South Brooklyn Marine Terminal was marked with a groundbreaking ceremony on June 10.\n\nThe project already has a client in the form of the 54-turbine, 810-gigawatt Empire I offshore wind farm, which comes under the umbrella of the firm Equinor.\n\nAfter that, attention will turn to other opportunities. \"When completed, the facility will be one of the largest dedicated offshore wind hubs in the United States, designed to accommodate future offshore wind projects,\" Equinor explained in a press statement.\n\nThat most likely includes Empire Wind II, which will weigh in at 1,260 megawatts.\n\nTo ice the green cake, the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal is planned as a \"low-emissions facility,\" with an assist from solar power. EV charging stations are also part of the package.\n\nThe quick revival of offshore wind plans for the Atlantic coast is a poke in the eye of fossil energy stakeholders, some of which have reportedly lent a hand to local groups opposed to offshore wind.\n\nIn the early 2000s, it was possible for the opposition to squash offshore projects. However, renewable energy stakeholders have grown more financial muscle since then, and they are not afraid to throw their weight around.\n\nEquinor, for example, describes itself as \"a broad international energy company and one of the largest offshore wind developers in the world.\" In addition to the 2 gigawatts' worth of offshore wind represented by the Empire projects, Equinor has another 2.1 gigawatts planned for elsewhere in the US.\n\n\"The United States is an attractive growth market for Equinor,\" the company adds, noting that its overall renewable energy plan anticipates a total capacity of 12-16 gigawatts globally, by 2030.\n\nThat's just Equinor. Another wind industry stakeholder to keep an eye on is \u00d8rsted, which is counting on 5 gigawatts of offshore wind along the US East coast.

These keystones are marine spatial planning (how we use our sea space), seabed leasing, planning and delivery of the electricity grid and financial support mechanisms for offshore wind. To address this misalignment, the report recommends focussing on four measures to improve the legislative and policy frameworks that govern all aspects of an offshore wind project:\n\nRenewableUK's Kat Route-Stephens, who leads the Environment and Consents programme for OWIC, said:\n\n\"Implementing the four key measures set out in this report is vital to speed up the delivery of the UK's world-class pipeline of offshore wind projects.

Main figures of the sector:\n\nWind energy is the technology that contributes the most to our energy system, exceeding 23.5% of demand coverage in 2023 and 25% so far in 2024.\n\nSpain surpasses the mark of 30 GW of installed wind power. We need to install 5.2 GW per year to achieve the objectives (62 GW wind, including 3 GW of offshore wind, by 2030).\n\nIn 2023, 607.2 MW of wind power will have been installed. The installation rate is well below that necessary to meet the objectives established by the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan (PNIEC).\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the total installed power in Spain was 30,425 MW. The more than 22,200 wind turbines installed in Spain in 1,371 wind farms generated 62,594 GWh of electricity, 2.4% more than in 2022.\n\nThe wind industry in Spain has 100% of the value chain with more than 280 manufacturing centers in 16 of the 17 Autonomous Communities.\n\n47 provinces have wind generation, of which 20 generate more than 1 TWh of electricity thanks to the wind. Castilla y Le\u00f3n with 6,517 MW is the autonomous community with the highest installed wind power and Arag\u00f3n has been in 2023 the autonomous community that has stood out for its increase in wind power with 307 new MW, followed by Castilla La Mancha (92 MW) and Catalonia ( 60 MW).\n\nSpanish wind power is the fifth power in the world in the ranking of countries with the highest installed wind power and the second in Europe.\n\nWind energy contributes more than 5.8 billion euros to the Spanish economy, 0.50% of GDP, with exports valued at more than 2.5 billion euros.\n\nThe wind sector in Spain currently employs 40,000 people, and this figure is expected to double by 2030.\n\nInvestment in R&D is a key and prominent point of wind technology:\n\nSpain is the first developer of floating offshore wind prototypes\n\nIt is the third country in Europe and the 4th in the world in terms of applications for wind patents in Spain. The wind sector has made more than 350 publications of patent applications in Spain in 2022\n\nFrom an environmental point of view, thanks to wind power, 32.7 million tons of CO2 are avoided each year in Spain.\n\nWind generation helps reduce the price of the daily electricity market: in 2023 the reducing effect of wind power was \u20ac20.41/MWh, which has meant a cumulative gross savings achieved by wind power of \u20ac5,321M to the consumers. That is, thanks to wind power, the price of electricity fell by 19%.\n\nPOWER AND WIND GENERATION IN SPAIN\n\nSpain has experienced notable progress in the installation of wind energy, surpassing the 30 GW mark. This achievement is a significant milestone for the energy sector and reflects the country's commitment to the transition to cleaner and more sustainable sources. However, it is important to highlight that the figure of 607.23 MW installed in 2023, although positive, is well below the 5.2 GW per year necessary to meet the ambitious objectives established by the PNIEC.\n\nRANKING BY CCAA AND PROVINCES\n\nThe autonomous communities with the highest total installed wind power are Castilla y Le\u00f3n (6,517 MW), Arag\u00f3n (5,229.11 MW) and Castilla La Mancha (4,878.34 MW).\n\nWith respect to the new installed power during 2023, the ranking of the autonomous communities is headed by Aragon (307 MW), Castilla La Mancha (92 MW), Catalonia (60.48 MW), Extremadura (50 MW) and Andalusia (36 MW ).\n\nRegarding the provinces, Zaragoza remains in first position, generating 15% of all Spanish wind generation in 2023.\n\nCurrently, in Spain, there are 47 provinces with wind generation, of which 20 generate more than 1 TWh of electricity thanks to the wind.\n\nWind power generates electricity for more than 17 million homes in Spain.\n\nTHE REDUCING EFFECT OF WIND POWER ON THE BILL\n\nWind generation contributes significantly to reducing the price of the daily electricity market, this is a great benefit to Spanish consumers, and a great competitive advantage over neighboring countries. The gross savings from wind power in 2023 have been lower than in 2022, mainly due to the fact that the price of MW/h in 2023 has been 48% lower than the previous year.\n\nIn 2023 the Reducing Effect of wind power was \u20ac20.41/MWh, which has meant a cumulative gross savings achieved by wind power of \u20ac5,321 M for consumers. That is, thanks to wind power, the price of electricity fell by 19%.\n\nBIG WORLD TRENDS\n\nThe wind industry installed a record 116.6 GW of new capacity in 2023 and the second highest for offshore wind (11 GW), making it the best year ever for new wind energy. It represents a year-on-year increase of 50% compared to 2022.\n\nThe year 2023 has been a year of continued growth for wind energy globally, 54 countries on all continents built new wind energy, with the Asia Pacific region leading the growth and China consolidating itself as the country with the largest installed wind capacity by global level. Wind energy continues to play a key role in the transition to a more sustainable and decarbonized energy system around the world.\n\nThe sector passed the symbolic milestone of 1 TW installed globally and, at the same time, continuing with this growth, it is expected to exceed 2 TW before 2030. At the end of last year there were already 81 countries with more than 100 MW of wind power installed.\n\nFurthermore, the historic adoption at COP28 of a goal of tripling renewable energy by 2030 to accelerate the energy transition process and put the planet on a path to compliance with the Paris Agreement, demonstrated the extent to which the world needs wind energy to achieve its climate goals.\n\nEUROPEAN OBJECTIVES FOR 2030 AND 2050\n\nWind energy now covers 19% of Europe's electricity demand and much more in many countries such as 55% in Denmark; Ireland 34%; United Kingdom 28%; Portugal 26% and Germany 26%. In Spain, it currently covers 25%.\n\nThe European Commission estimates that wind energy will account for half of Europe's electricity by 2050, with wind energy capacity increasing from the current 220 GW to up to 1,300 GW. This implies a 25-fold increase in offshore wind energy in the EU. But most of the GW capacity increase will come from onshore wind.\n\nIt is estimated that 18 GW per year of new capacity will be installed in the EU until 2027. But 30 GW per year would be necessary to meet the objectives established in REPowerEU.", "source": {"uri": "evwind.es", "dataType": "news", "title": "AEEolica"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This is why, as announced by President von der Leyen in her September 2023 State of the Union speech, the European Commission has developed a European Wind Power Action Plan \"to ensure that the clean energy transition goes hand-in-hand with industrial competitiveness and that wind power continues to be a European success story.\"\n\nThe Action Plan, launched on 23 October 2023, aims to help maintain a \"healthy and competitive wind energy supply chain, with a clear and secure pipeline of projects, attracting the necessary financing and competing on a level playing field globally.\" It was accompanied by a communication on delivering on the EU's offshore energy ambition, including wind power, following up on the EU Offshore Renewable Energy Strategy adopted three years ago.\n\nThe Action Plan sets out immediate actions to be taken together by the Commission, the Member States and the wind power industry, building on existing policies and legislation, and focusing on six main areas:\n\nAcceleration of deployment through increased predictability and faster permitting. A record 16 GW of wind power installations were added in Europe in 2022, which is a 47% increase compared to 2021. This is however well below the 37 GW/year required to achieve the EU 2030 target for renewable energy. The Commission is launching the \"Accele-RES\" initiative with Member States to ensure swift implementation of the revised EU renewable energy rules, putting more focus on the digitalisation of permitting processes and technical assistance to Member States. In addition, Member States are encouraged to enhance the visibility of the project pipeline through wind pledges, transparent auction schedules, and long-term planning. The Commission says it will support the necessary build-out of electricity grids with a Grids Action Plan later this year.\n\nImproved auction design. Building on the proposed Net-Zero Industry Act and the reform of the Electricity Market Design, the Commission will support Member States in improving auctions with \"well-designed and objective criteria which reward higher value-added equipment and ensure that projects are realised fully and on time.\" Beyond the EU, Global Gateway projects will increase their use of strategic procurement standards. The Action Plan also foresees a cybersecurity risk assessment.\n\nAccess to finance. To speed up investment and financing for wind energy manufacturing in Europe, the Commission says it will facilitate access to EU financing, notably through the Innovation Fund, while the European Investment Bank (EIB) will make de-risking guarantees available. The Commission also encourages Member States to make full use of the flexibility provided by the amended Temporary State Aid Crisis and Transition Framework to support wind manufacturing in the EU.\n\nA fair and competitive international environment. To ensure that the wind sector can operate on a level playing field, the Commission says it closely monitors possible unfair trade practices which benefit foreign wind manufacturers and will continue to use trade agreements to facilitate access to foreign markets, while promoting the adoption of EU and international standards for the sector. The Commission will also engage with investors to identify and address obstacles to investment.\n\nSkills. Large-Scale Skills Partnerships for Renewable Energy is described as a key forum to develop skills development projects. With the Net-Zero Industry Act, the Commission says it will also facilitate the launch of European net-zero industry skills academies - including one dedicated to the wind sector, designed to support Member States' actions to upskill and reskill workers. The academies will develop learning content and materials and will aim to train 100,000 learners within three years of establishment.\n\nIndustry engagement and Member States commitments. The Commission says it will work with Member States and the wind industry on an EU Wind Charter to improve the enabling conditions for the European industry to remain competitive.\n\nOffshore wind is expected to make a significant contribution to the EU's climate and energy goals in the years ahead, says the Commission. Building on the Offshore Renewable Energy Strategy from 2020, Member States recently agreed on ambitious new goals for offshore renewable power generation by 2050, with intermediate goals for 2030 and 2040 for each of the EU's five sea basins.\n\nIn 2022, the cumulative EU-27 offshore installed capacity amounted to 16.3 GW. This means that to bridge the gap between the 111 GW committed by the Member States and the 2022 capacity, almost 12 GW must be installed per year on average - that is ten times more than the new 1.2 GW installed last year.\n\nThis is why, says the Commission, it is doubling down on its efforts to support the offshore renewables sector specifically, setting out additional actions to: strengthen grid infrastructure and regional cooperation; accelerate permitting; ensure integrated maritime spatial planning; strengthen resilience of infrastructure; sustain research and innovation; and develop supply chains and skills.\n\nLooking at the wider picture, renewables are a key component of the EU's plan to reach climate neutrality by 2050 under the European Green Deal, as well as of the REPowerEU Plan to regain energy independence and end imports of Russian fossil fuels as soon as possible. The EU has set legislative targets for an accelerated roll-out of renewable energy through the revised Renewable Energy Directive under the Fit for 55 legislative package and facilitates this through the revised TEN-E Regulation strengthening the framework for cross-border projects including offshore grids. In the transition to a net-zero economy, the EU's competitiveness will strongly rely on its capacity to develop and manufacture at home the clean technologies that make this transition possible, including onshore and offshore wind, says the Commission. Earlier this year, it presented the Green Deal Industrial Plan and notably proposed the Net-Zero Industry Act and the Critical Raw Materials Act to support the domestic manufacturing capacity of net-zero technologies (as successfully incentivised in the USA by the IRA).\n\nKadri Simson, Commissioner for Energy said: \"The EU is determined to lead the energy transition and to seize the opportunity to create economic growth and green jobs. The wind sector is key to the achievement of our clean energy and climate goals, but we need to make sure it can do business in a fair and supportive environment. We are committed to working together with Member States and the industry to turn our legislative targets into reality on the ground.\"", "source": {"uri": "nsenergybusiness.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NS Business"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Auction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of the Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raw material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Investment_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Investment Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital transformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrical grid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procurement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Procurement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Risk assessment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadri_Simson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kadri Simson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provisional Irish Republican Army"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 26}], "image": "https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/06/wind-turbine-937715_1920.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663318", "eventUri": "eng-9663318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

It's the most controversial zone to date, with consultation attracting a record 14,211 submissions - of which 65% were opposed.\n\nThe zone's declaration has inflamed fierce debate over the pathway to decarbonisation, particularly in industrial regions. The Illawarra hosts heavy industries such as Australia's largest steel manufacturer, BlueScope Steel.\n\nIn response to the announcement, National Party Leader David Littleproud declared Australia doesn't need \"large-scale industrial windfarms\". He argues the focus should instead be on household solar and battery storage.\n\nSo what is the role of offshore wind in our future energy mix? Here we argue offshore wind energy has three main advantages: scale, availability and proximity. It's just what Australia needs.\n\nOffshore wind has substantial energy-production potential. A single 100-turbine project is capable of generating up to 1.5 gigawatts (GW) of energy and the Illawarra zone could contain two projects (2.9GW).\n\nTo put this in perspective, Eraring, Australia's largest coal-fired power station near Lake Macquarie in New South Wales, also produces 2.9GW.\n\nBecause offshore wind is more consistent than either onshore wind or rooftop solar, it is the most practical way to provide time-sensitive renewable energy grid security for large energy users.\n\nThis high-capacity, consistent energy source is particularly crucial for Australia's industrial decarbonisation efforts. BlueScope Steel, for example, estimates it will need approximately 15 times its current energy consumption to transition to green steel-making operations in the Illawarra region.\n\nOffshore wind blows more consistently than onshore wind. We can quantify this by comparing so-called \"capacity factors\".\n\nThe capacity factor is the actual output of a power station over a given period of time, divided by the theoretical power that could be generated if the plant operated at full output for the same period of time.\n\nOnshore wind has a capacity factor of 30%, meaning 1GW of onshore wind farms can be relied upon to deliver 0.3GW of output at any time.\n\nOffshore wind has a capacity factor of at least 50%.\n\nFor reference, coal plants in Australia, due to their age and condition, have a capacity factor of 60% and this falls further every year.\n\nIt is a common myth that coal is reliable. The reliability of Australian coal fired generators is currently at an all time low and falling.\n\nThe Coalition's plan for nuclear power plants announced on Wednesday might look like an alternative answer to the energy availability challenge. But the plan relies on coal in the meantime and coal-fired power plants have a limited lifespan. It's highly unlikely those nuclear power stations could be built in time to take over from coal.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency publishes a step-by-step guide to going nuclear. This internationally recognised manual says it takes 10-15 years for a country to go from initial consideration of the nuclear power option to operation of its first nuclear power plant.\n\nSo the first big problem with nuclear in Australia is, how do we ensure we have reliable power for the five to ten year gap between when most of the coal exits and the first nuclear power plant could possibly be commissioned?\n\nMost of Australia's population and industry is near the east coast. Placing electricity generation near to where it is needed is more efficient. It also avoids having to construct many kilometres of new overhead electricity transmission lines to connect onshore wind farms far inland.\n\nAustralia is leading the world in the uptake of home solar panels and batteries. This is definitely worthwhile. But contrary to Littleproud's suggestion, it's not the whole solution to Australia's decarbonisation effort. For example, it won't solve the problem of the need to electrify heavy industry.\n\nBlueScope has stated that to decarbonise its current steel-making operations, it will need 15 times more electricity. This is the equivalent of the solar exported by a staggering 3.6 million homes - more than one-third of the total number of homes connected to the National Electricity Market.\n\nPutting this into perspective, the Illawarra region has 130,000 homes. By our calculations, the BlueScope steelworks currently uses the same amount of electricity each day as the total solar exported by 240,000 homes - assuming generous export of 10kWh per home and Bluescope's daily use of 240,000 kWh of energy.\n\nEven if the Illawarra had enough homes exporting solar power to electrify BlueScope's operations, getting this electricity to where it's needed is technically impossible. Home solar systems are connected to the lowest capacity part of the energy grid - the wires in the street. We simply don't have the capacity to move gigawatts of power from rooftop solar to large energy users such as steel and aluminium plants.\n\nAustralia needs large-scale electricity generation. The Coalition has recognised this, and is now promoting large nuclear power plants as well as small modular reactors.\n\nThe clean energy transition requires multiple renewable energy sources to meet different needs. There is no \"one size fits all\" solution - and there is clearly an important role for offshore wind in this mix.\n\nWe can expect to see Australia's first offshore wind farms operating in Victoria's Gippsland by the end of the decade.\n\nThe Coalition remains committed to the Gippsland project. But it has signalled its intention to scrap proposed offshore wind zones in the Illawarra and Hunter, if elected.\n\nThis decision would have flow-on effects. An industry is emerging around the pipeline of potential wind energy projects. The latest announcement will almost certainly heighten tensions surrounding the already bitter debates raging in our communities.\n\nIt is common for the media and politicians to frame energy debates as a blunt binary of support versus opposition for different options, such as offshore wind. Yet genuine progress requires respectful dialogue and a commitment to finding common ground.\n\nFor the Illawarra, we argue much greater attention must be paid to the methods, models and outcomes of community engagement. We need to involve the community in constructive conversations about the nature, scale and scope of our future energy mix, which may include offshore wind.\n\nIndependent scientific research can provide the evidence base for such crucial decisions about the future of our communities and industries.\n\nTy Christopher is currently leading a project which has received funding from the Commonwealth government to establish an Energy Futures Skills Centre at the University of Wollongong in partnership with NSW TAFE. He also provides strategic advice to government departments and private sector companies on clean energy matters as a private consultant.\n\nMichelle Voyer has led a number of projects that have received funding from the Commonwealth government and the NSW state government, including the Australian Research Council and the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, as well as the United Nations Environment Program and the Nippon Foundation.

A few examples of their misinformation:\n\n* The article claims that the fossil fuel industry \"almost never\" funds campaigns against wind energy. The fossil fuel industry's extensive campaign against offshore wind and renewables in general has been going on for years and is well documented in articles such as, \"The oil and gas industry is behind offshore wind misinformation,\" published just last year by the Center for American Progress.\n\n* Ms. Davis does not appear to know the definition of renewable energy, claiming that \"there is not a single aspect of the offshore wind industry that is renewable.\" \"Renewable\" refers to the source of energy, not the means to capture it. A simple Google search for the definition confirms this: \"energy from a source that is not depleted when used, such as wind or solar power.\"\n\n* A third example is her claim that scientific monitoring of the environmental impacts of offshore wind does not exist. The Pacific Coast Offshore Wind Environmental Research Project Finder lists 120 scientific research projects relevant to the future of offshore wind on the Pacific Coast. On the East Coast, where offshore wind is operational, active monitoring is currently in progress.\n\n* And lastly (though I could easily expand this list), the one that saddens me most is the characterization of environmental NGOs as illogical and greedy for supporting offshore wind [in New Times' May 23 version of \"Semantics and spin\"]. This point is regrettable for two reasons: Firstly, it is precisely because of global warming and climate change that NGOs such as the local chapters of SLO Climate Coalition, SLO County Citizens' Climate Education, Sierra Club, Morro Coast Audubon Society, and Surfrider support offshore wind development. Offshore wind, when combined with energy storage systems, has the potential to replace dozens of fossil fuel power plants, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the production of electricity.\n\nSecondly, by its misinformed and divisive rhetoric, REACT destroys its credibility and alienates itself from environmental organizations that could be potential allies in their cause to protect ocean and coastal resources from unmitigated environmental impacts.\n\nThe environmental NGOs that I am a part of all recognize the potential for negative environmental impacts during the planning, construction, and operation of offshore wind. And we want the operators to do all they can to reduce or mitigate those impacts.\n\nBut we also understand that the negative environmental impact of continued combustion of fossil fuels to generate electricity is not just a potential problem, it is a current one, and it is causing extensive and ongoing damage to not only the marine environment but to the entire planet.\n\nWe need to transition from fossil fuels to clean energy sources, and offshore wind can and should be part of that transition.\n\nBarry Rands retired from the Morro Bay Department of Public Services in 2015 and is currently a member of the SLO Climate Coalition, the SLO County Citizens' Climate Education, and the Santa Lucia Chapter of the Sierra Club.

It's the most controversial zone to date, with consultation attracting a record 14,211 submissions - of which 65% were opposed.\n\nThe zone's declaration has inflamed fierce debate over the pathway to decarbonisation, particularly in industrial regions. The Illawarra hosts heavy industries such as Australia's largest steel manufacturer, BlueScope Steel.\n\nIn response to the announcement, National Party Leader David Littleproud declared Australia doesn't need \"large-scale industrial windfarms\". He argues the focus should instead be on household solar and battery storage.\n\nSo what is the role of offshore wind in our future energy mix? Here we argue offshore wind energy has three main advantages: scale, availability and proximity. It's just what Australia needs.\n\n1. Scale\n\nOffshore wind has substantial energy-production potential. A single 100-turbine project is capable of generating up to 1.5 gigawatts (GW) of energy and the Illawarra zone could contain two projects (2.9GW).\n\nTo put this in perspective, Eraring, Australia's largest coal-fired power station near Lake Macquarie in New South Wales, also produces 2.9GW.\n\nBecause offshore wind is more consistent than either onshore wind or rooftop solar, it is the most practical way to provide time-sensitive renewable energy grid security for large energy users.\n\nThis high-capacity, consistent energy source is particularly crucial for Australia's industrial decarbonisation efforts. BlueScope Steel, for example, estimates it will need approximately 15 times its current energy consumption to transition to green steel-making operations in the Illawarra region.\n\n2. Availability\n\nOffshore wind blows more consistently than onshore wind. We can quantify this by comparing so-called \"capacity factors\".\n\nThe capacity factor is the actual output of a power station over a given period of time, divided by the theoretical power that could be generated if the plant operated at full output for the same period of time.\n\nOnshore wind has a capacity factor of 30%, meaning 1GW of onshore wind farms can be relied upon to deliver 0.3GW of output at any time.\n\nOffshore wind has a capacity factor of at least 50%.\n\nFor reference, coal plants in Australia, due to their age and condition, have a capacity factor of 60% and this falls further every year.\n\nIt is a common myth that coal is reliable. The reliability of Australian coal fired generators is currently at an all time low and falling.\n\nThe Coalition's plan for nuclear power plants announced on Wednesday might look like an alternative answer to the energy availability challenge. But the plan relies on coal in the meantime and coal-fired power plants have a limited lifespan. It's highly unlikely those nuclear power stations could be built in time to take over from coal.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency publishes a step-by-step guide to going nuclear. This internationally recognised manual says it takes 10-15 years for a country to go from initial consideration of the nuclear power option to operation of its first nuclear power plant.\n\nSo the first big problem with nuclear in Australia is, how do we ensure we have reliable power for the five to ten year gap between when most of the coal exits and the first nuclear power plant could possibly be commissioned?\n\n3. Proximity\n\nMost of Australia's population and industry is near the east coast. Placing electricity generation near to where it is needed is more efficient. It also avoids having to construct many kilometres of new overhead electricity transmission lines to connect onshore wind farms far inland.\n\nAustralia is leading the world in the uptake of home solar panels and batteries. This is definitely worthwhile. But contrary to Littleproud's suggestion, it's not the whole solution to Australia's decarbonisation effort. For example, it won't solve the problem of the need to electrify heavy industry.\n\nBlueScope has stated that to decarbonise its current steel-making operations, it will need 15 times more electricity. This is the equivalent of the solar exported by a staggering 3.6 million homes - more than one-third of the total number of homes connected to the National Electricity Market.\n\nPutting this into perspective, the Illawarra region has 130,000 homes. By our calculations, the BlueScope steelworks currently uses the same amount of electricity each day as the total solar exported by 240,000 homes - assuming generous export of 10kWh per home and Bluescope's daily use of 240,000 kWh of energy.\n\nEven if the Illawarra had enough homes exporting solar power to electrify BlueScope's operations, getting this electricity to where it's needed is technically impossible. Home solar systems are connected to the lowest capacity part of the energy grid - the wires in the street. We simply don't have the capacity to move gigawatts of power from rooftop solar to large energy users such as steel and aluminium plants.\n\nAustralia needs large-scale energy, including wind\n\nAustralia needs large-scale electricity generation. The Coalition has recognised this, and is now promoting large nuclear power plants as well as small modular reactors.\n\nThe clean energy transition requires multiple renewable energy sources to meet different needs. There is no \"one size fits all\" solution - and there is clearly an important role for offshore wind in this mix.\n\nWe can expect to see Australia's first offshore wind farms operating in Victoria's Gippsland by the end of the decade.\n\nThe Coalition remains committed to the Gippsland project. But it has signalled its intention to scrap proposed offshore wind zones in the Illawarra and Hunter, if elected.\n\nThis decision would have flow-on effects. An industry is emerging around the pipeline of potential wind energy projects. The latest announcement will almost certainly heighten tensions surrounding the already bitter debates raging in our communities.\n\nNavigating the contested waters of offshore wind\n\nIt is common for the media and politicians to frame energy debates as a blunt binary of support versus opposition for different options, such as offshore wind. Yet genuine progress requires respectful dialogue and a commitment to finding common ground.\n\nFor the Illawarra, we argue much greater attention must be paid to the methods, models and outcomes of community engagement. We need to involve the community in constructive conversations about the nature, scale and scope of our future energy mix, which may include offshore wind.\n\nIndependent scientific research can provide the evidence base for such crucial decisions about the future of our communities and industries.", "source": {"uri": "theconversation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Conversation"},

The report also calls for a more modern approach to avoiding delays.\n\nThe Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) predicts that supply chain bottlenecks will delay work on offshore wind farms \"in every region of the world except China\" from the mid-2020s.\n\nRecent high-profile delays include the SSE Renewables' Dogger Bank A project, originally scheduled for 2024, being postponed by a year due to adverse weather, vessel shortages and supply chain problems.\n\nSimilarly, a shortage of installation vessels forced \u00d8rsted to cancel two of its offshore wind farms off New Jersey in November 2023. Poor weather conditions postponed the commissioning of Japan's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm in 2022, and defective components delayed start-up of the country's first floating wind farm in 2023.\n\nHave you read?\n\nGenerative AI has 'turbocharged the power of the human' says Octopus Energy founder Greg Jackson\n\nIberdrola seeks startups to inspect and digitise wind farms\n\nIn the paper, Simon Rasmus Jacobsen, senior consultant at Heron Energy, says: \"Many companies still rely on simple word processing documents or spreadsheets to plan and communicate about projects. Some developers have tried to avoid these problems by building their own in-house software systems, but these can make it hard to respond to delays as they are more focused on reporting about progress than planning for changes.\"\n\nNew technologies like floating foundations, larger and more complex turbines, port infrastructure constraints, skills shortages and escalating equipment and construction costs are adding additional layers of complexity and uncertainty.\n\nA reliance on insufficient systems creates tension in a maturing industry that desperately requires the use of more advanced solutions with the ability to connect, clarify and solve complex issues.\n\nThe whitepaper urges the industry to abandon its historic reliance on antiquated and disjointed project management and planning systems. Instead, it advocates for the adoption of comprehensive cloud-based platforms designed specifically for the industry, which allow developers to quickly produce digital simulations of their construction projects, incorporating new parameters within minutes instead of days or weeks. This agility enables developers to swiftly adapt to the changing circumstances that typically delay construction projects.\n\nOutdated tools lack essential features, including historical weather data, ongoing project review during construction, the ability to refine project designs in real-time, to see and mitigate the knock-on effect of delays on the rest of a project and collaborative decision-making tools for optimising outcomes.\n\nNew digital solutions and simulation techniques have enhanced visibility, integration and functionality to increase the likelihood that projects are completed on time and within budget, strengthening the sector's chances of long-term success and prosperity. The industry needs to wake up to the need to use simulation technology throughout a wind farm lifecycle.\n\nAlso of interest\n\nSite visit: Europe's biggest offshore wind port\n\nMichael Bjerrum, chief commercial officer and co-founder at Shoreline Wind, commented: \"Simulations were initially used in early design, but are highly valuable right up to commissioning.\n\n\"Developers constantly see different delays during construction. They might see bad weather, maybe half of their jacket structures are late, and then perhaps a key installation vessel arrives later than planned, too. Using a simulation solution throughout construction enables companies to constantly update the live schedules of projects. These are complex projects with so many moving parts, so it's helpful to have a live progress overview.\n\n\"You might have two turbine installation vessels working in parallel with vessels doing piling and maybe one or two doing jackets. It's a complex environment out there to have these simultaneous operations, and so it is important to constantly optimise because reducing construction costs can save you a lot of money,\" he concluded.\n\nThe whitepaper calls on the offshore wind industry to embrace new digital tools. By leveraging advanced project management systems designed specifically for the sector, developers and contractors can improve collaboration, foresee and mitigate delays, and ultimately deliver projects as quickly and efficiently as possible.", "source": {"uri": "powerengineeringint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Power Engineering International"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_paper", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White paper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Offshore wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Wind_Energy_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Global Wind Energy Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE_Renewables", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SSE Renewables"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogger_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dogger Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_farm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wind farm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00d8rsted_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "\u00d8rsted (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Octopus Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Word processor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_wind_turbine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Floating wind turbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Simulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spreadsheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberdrola", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iberdrola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_wind_port", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offshore wind port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Project_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Project Management", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Consulting", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Offshore_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Offshore Services", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Marketplaces", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.powerengineeringint.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/wind-digitalisation.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663318", "eventUri": "eng-9663318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

China and the UK retain their top positions with 36.7GW and 14.7GW operational respectively. Germany is third with 8.3GW, the Netherlands fourth with 3.7GW and Denmark fifth with 2.7GW:\n\nThe report forecasts that global operational offshore wind capacity could soar to 277GW by the end of 2030, marking nearly a fourfold increase from current levels.\n\nThe global pipeline of projects, including all stages from operational to early development, has increased slightly to 1,231GW from 1,228GW a year ago. This includes over 1,500 projects spanning 41 countries. The smaller increase compared to previous years is attributed to developers refining their portfolios and advancements in leasing and consenting processes worldwide.\n\n-- Advertisement --\n\nChina has the largest pipeline (227GW), with the UK second at 96GW across 122 projects in UK waters. The USA is in third place with 94GW, Sweden fourth on 68GW and Brazil fifth with 61GW:\n\nThe report reveals that the UK has 15.8GW of offshore wind capacity in the planning system awaiting a decision - the highest amount ever in planning at one time.\n\nThe report highlights that 10,774MW (10.8GW) of new UK offshore wind capacity are eligible for this year's Contracts for Difference auction (AR6), including 12 fixed-foundation projects and 4 floating projects. With an average operational timeline of 5 years post-CfD award, capacity allocated in the next two rounds could significantly support the UK's target of achieving 50GW by 2030. The report projects that nearly 44GW of capacity could be operational in UK waters by the end of the decade, encompassing projects that may be partially operational by then.\n\nRenewableUK's Chief Executive Dan McGrail said: \"It's great to see we've reached a landmark 75 gigawatts of offshore wind operational worldwide, with the UK maintaining its place as a global leader in an intensely competitive international market.\n\n\"To consolidate the UK's position even further, we're asking the next government to maximise the amount of offshore wind capacity we can secure in this year's auction for new projects. The current budget will only enable less than half the capacity which is eligible to go ahead, and the floating wind budget will only secure one project even though four can bid in this year, so we need to see more ambition within the first few days of the new government taking office.\n\n\"It's also significant that the UK has a record high of more than 15 gigawatts of new offshore wind capacity in planning. We'll be urging the next government to reform the planning system to enable projects to go ahead in a more timely manner, to increase the UK's energy security and drive down bills for consumers.\"\n\nThe report is being published the day before RenewableUK's 2-day Global Offshore Wind 2024 conference and exhibition in Manchester.", "source": {"uri": "constructionireland.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Construction Ireland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Offshore wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RenewableUK", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RenewableUK"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_for_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contract for difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oil refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_permission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Planning permission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Offshore_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Offshore Services", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Performance_and_Capacity/Capacity_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Performance and Capacity/Capacity Planning", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Globalization", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Globalization", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Global_Governance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Global Governance", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.constructionireland.ie/newsimages/1_309180_Offshore_2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663318", "eventUri": "eng-9663318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

Turning steadily in the breeze, the vast array of offshore and onshore turbinesaround Great Britain provide about a quarter of our electricity needs, with no carbon emissions and at a cost below imported gas or nuclear generation. They are a national success story. We have the second biggest offshore turbine fleet in the world, behind only China.\n\nThe Tory government effectively banned onshore wind turbines in 2015. But at the same time, the growth in offshore wind can be traced back to a 2014 decision to establish a new support mechanism for low-carbon generation. Called \"contracts for difference\", it guarantees a set price for units of electricity. If the market price falls below the set price, the generator receives a top-up payment. If the market price rises above the set price, the generator pays back the difference.\n\nIt essentially stabilises the market and provides certainty for power generators, making it worth their while to invest for the long term. As a result of this and similar policies, the cost of offshore wind in Europe has fallen by 60% over the past decade, to become a cheap source of electricity.\n\nWhen energy prices went through the roof following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, not only did wind provide a cheaper alternative to gas, windfarms and other renewables projects actually refunded a further \u00a3660m to consumers through their bills, as they paid back the difference when the market price rose above the set price they had been guaranteed. The energy crisis would have been worse without wind power.\n\nOffshore wind is a rare manufacturing success story, too. The turbine blades can now be made in the UK, at the Siemens Gamesa facility in Hull, with the Humber estuary enjoying a renaissance as a low-carbon jobs and skills hub. This is levelling up in action. Overall, the shift to renewable electricity has been so successful that it enjoys almost unanimous support from business. A decade ago, Energy UK, the trade association representing big energy companies, was a barrier to climate progress because its members made money from burning fossil fuels. Now, Energy UK urges faster, more ambitious policy for net zero. It's quite the change. Renewables are remarkably popular, too, with polls consistently showing strong levels of public support.\n\nThe success of renewables in the UK points to a winning formula for climate strategy: set out an ambitious plan; align economic policy with climate goals; design incentives that encourage investment through creating certainty; and listen to public opinion. And so it is all the more surprising that subsequent Conservative administrations have not learned from this success.\n\nThere were some encouraging noises from Boris Johnson, an unlikely champion of net-zero technologies. But then Tory politicians began to listen to siren voices from a small but powerful anti-net-zero lobby, funded by dark money from fossil-fuel companies, pushing the line that climate policies would be expensive and unpopular. When energy bills rocketed, Rishi Sunak could have pointed out that Conservative policies had made homegrown renewables the cheapest form of power. Instead, he made a spurious argument that more investment in fossil fuels was the way to bring bills down, trashing his party's own legacy in the process.\n\nThe climate culture wars have left people and businesses confused, and this matters. It matters for business, because it erodes the certainty that they need to invest - the certainty that propelled offshore wind. It matters for people, too. Our research at the Lancaster University Climate Citizens project presents a remarkably consistent picture, backed up by polling evidence too. People are worried about the climate crisis and want to see leadership from government. At the same time, they don't trust the government to provide that leadership, so they turn to cynicism or, even worse, fatalism. They just don't think that politicians have what it takes to turn this around. They haven't heard of successes that would contradict this narrative, such as the case of offshore wind.\n\nThe way forward for the government is clear. It must say it understands and shares people's concerns; put forward bold policies that tell people it means business and provide that certainty investors need; involve people in decisions that affect them (for example, the next generation of renewables could be part-owned by the communities that host them); and prioritise those policies that improve people's lives and reduce costs.\n\nThere are whispers of this approach in Keir Starmer's offering, with GB Energy, Labour's publicly owned energy company, and its promises to bring energy bills down through better home insulation. Meanwhile, Labour-led cities such as Manchester and London have shown that you can improve people's lives while bringing down emissions, through prioritising public transport and cycling - and voters have rewarded them. It does not yet add up to a bold strategy. As party leaders from both left and right tour seaside constituencies, let's hope the sight of giant blades turning in the sea breeze reminds them of what is possible if you think big on the climate crisis.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_wind_power", "type": "wiki",

This has primarily been made possible by several long-term corporate power purchase agreements (CPPA), which \u00d8rsted has signed with industrial and technology customers.\n\nOnce the offshore wind farm has been commissioned in 2025, an offtake agreements totalling 786 MW have been entered into with Amazon (350 MW), BASF (186 MW), Covestro (100 MW), Energie-Handels-Gesellschaft/REWE Group (100 MW), and Google (50 MW). The contracts range from 10 to 25 years. The agreements create long-term price security both for \u00d8rsted as project developer and for the customers.\n\nBorkum Riffgrund 3 is jointly owned by \u00d8rsted and Nuveen Infrastructure.\n\nThis milestone for Borkum Riffgrund 3 follows shortly after the successful delivery of first power from the 253 MW Gode Wind 3 Offshore Wind Farm, which \u00d8rsted and Nuveen Infrastructure are constructing simultaneously with Borkum Riffgrund 3.\n\nTogether, the two offshore wind farms will close to double \u00d8rsted's total installed capacity in Germany and make an important contribution to Germany's green transformation.\n\nBorkum Riffgrund 3 is the first offshore wind farm to be built by \u00d8rsted in Germany without an offshore substation (OSS). The new connection concept provides for a direct connection of the wind turbines via 66 kV connection cables to the DolWin epsilon offshore converter platform operated by the German transmission system operator, TenneT.\n\n\"Borkum Riffgrund 3 is an icebreaker in offshore wind. It was the first offshore wind project in the world to be awarded on a merchant basis, and it's the first offshore wind farm in Germany to break the 900 MW-mark.

Being one of the fastest growing economies in Southeast Asia, it is vital that the country find ways to decouple economic growth from energy consumption and invest in renewable energy and energy efficient technologies.\n\nTo this, a line of tangible recommendations has been outlined in the 'Viet Nam Energy Outlook Report - Pathways to Net Zero', which is the fourth report in a series of outlook publications under the Danish - Vietnamese Energy Partnership Programme. The report presents scenarios for the development of the Vietnamese energy system towards 2050, focusing on analysing realistic pathways for Vietnam to achieve its net-zero commitment by 2050.\n\nThe report shows that the most cost-effective way to support Vietnam's sustainable growth is through significant expansion of solar and wind power, as well as the electrification of transportation and industry.\n\nParticularly, the report puts forward concrete recommendations on how Vietnam can achieve climate neutrality by 2050 and ensure that the CO\u2082 emissions peak by 2030.\n\nWith enormous potential for solar power, onshore and offshore wind, Vietnam is well positioned to transform its energy sector from fossil fuels to renewable energy and leverage its national resources. The report demonstrates how Vietnam through massive expansion of renewable energy, along electrification of its industry and transport sectors, can secure a cost-efficient green transition and reach its target of net-zero emissions in 2050, while also reducing Vietnam's dependence on energy imports. According to the analysis, an additional 56 gigawatts of renewable energy (17 GW onshore wind and 39 GW solar) need to be added by 2030 if Vietnam is to stay on track for carbon peak by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050. Any delays in the transition will be costly, not least from increased climate change impacts.\n\nIntegrating such vast amounts of fluctuating power generation in the power grid will require deliberate actions too. The report also shows how in the near term, the country's coal-fired power plants must become more flexible, so that coal power can be turned down to give green power priority in the electricity supply while still providing backup capacity until storage and other solutions can be implemented.\n\nTo fulfil Vietnam's ambition to build 84 GW of offshore wind by 2050 it requires strong commitment and immediate actions. Accelerating the issuance of a clear and predictable legal framework is particularly essential to attract the needed investments for the development of the offshore wind industry. Along this line, the report recommends that Vietnam starts designating offshore areas, preparing port infrastructure, and strengthening the power grid.", "source": {"uri": "stateofgreen.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "State of Green"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_consumption", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Energy consumption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Efficient energy use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offshore wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Effects of climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal-fired_power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coal-fired power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electrical grid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://stateofgreen.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/kim-hanh-do-txzRYdUhGns-unsplash-1-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663318", "eventUri": "eng-9663318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6235294117647059, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

A new whitepaper from Shoreline Wind, 'How Developers Can Reduce Construction Delays at Offshore Wind Farms', pinpoints the pressing need for a modernised approach to managing and avoiding such delays.\n\nThe report explores the potential construction delays in offshore wind, which are numerous and complex. These include inclement weather, vessel availability, supply chain delays and constraints, accidents, and even regional challenges, such as Taiwan's seabed conditions and typhoons.\n\nRecent high-profile delays include the SSE Renewables' Dogger Bank A project, originally scheduled for 2024, being postponed by a year due to adverse weather, vessel shortages, and supply chain problems.\n\nSimilarly, a shortage of installation vessels forced \u00d8rsted to cancel two of its offshore wind farms off New Jersey in November 2023. Poor weather conditions postponed the commissioning of Japan's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm in 2022, and defective components delayed start-up of the country's first floating wind farm in 2023. The Global\n\nWind Energy Council (GWEC) predicts that supply chain bottlenecks will delay work on offshore wind farms \"in every region of the world except China\" from the mid-2020s.\n\nIn the paper Simon Rasmus Jacobsen, Senior Consultant at Heron Energy, says: \"Many companies still rely on simple word processing documents or spreadsheets to plan and communicate about projects. Some developers have tried to avoid these problems by building their own in-house software systems, but these can make it hard to respond to delays as they are more focused on reporting about progress than planning for changes.\"\n\nNew technologies like floating foundations, larger and more complex turbines, port infrastructure constraints, skills shortages, and escalating equipment and construction costs are adding additional layers of complexity and uncertainty. A reliance on insufficient systems creates tension in a maturing industry that desperately requires the use of more advanced solutions with the ability to connect, clarify, and solve complex issues.\n\nThe whitepaper urges the industry to abandon its historic reliance on antiquated and disjointed project management and planning systems. Instead, it advocates for the adoption of comprehensive cloud-based platforms designed specifically for the industry, which allow developers to quickly produce digital simulations of their construction projects, incorporating new parameters within minutes instead of days or weeks. This agility enables developers to swiftly adapt to the changing circumstances that typically delay construction projects.\n\nOutdated tools lack essential features, including historical weather data, ongoing project review during construction, the ability to refine project designs in real-time, to see and mitigate the knock-on effect of delays on the rest of a project, and collaborative decision-making tools for optimising outcomes.\n\nNew digital solutions and simulation techniques have the enhanced visibility, integration, and functionality to increase the likelihood that projects are completed on time and within budget, strengthening the sector's chances of long-term success and prosperity. The industry needs to wake up to the need to use simulation technology throughout a windfarm lifecycle.\n\nMichael Bjerrum, Chief Commercial Officer and Co-Founder at Shoreline Wind, says: \"Simulations were initially used in early design, but are highly valuable right up to commissioning.\n\n\"Developers constantly see different delays during construction. They might see bad weather, maybe half of their jacket structures are late, and then perhaps a key installation vessel arrives later than planned, too. Using a simulation solution throughout construction enables companies to constantly update the live schedules of projects. These are complex projects with so many moving parts, so it's helpful to have a live progress overview.\n\n\"You might have two turbine installation vessels working in parallel with vessels doing piling, and maybe one or two doing jackets. It's a complex environment out there to have these simultaneous operations, and so it is important to constantly optimise because reducing construction costs can save you a lot of money,\" he said.\n\nThe whitepaper calls on the offshore wind industry to embrace new digital tools. By leveraging advanced project management systems designed specifically for the sector, developers and contractors can improve collaboration, foresee and mitigate delays, and ultimately deliver projects as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n\nShoreline Wind is the premier provider of comprehensive SaaS solutions for the wind industry, encompassing the entire lifecycle from Design, Construction, to O&M.

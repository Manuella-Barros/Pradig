This layer just below the crust is the largest part of the planet's interior, so understanding it can tell us a great deal about some of Earth's more explosive characteristics. This nearly continuous 4,160 feet (1,268 meters) of mantle rock is described in a study published August 8 in the journal Science. The rocks reveal a more extensive history of melting in the recovered rocks than the team initially expected.\n\n[Related: Earthquake models get a big shakeup with clues buried in the San Andreas fault.]\n\nThe rocks were recovered from a tectonic window-a section of the seabed where rocks from the Earth's mantle were exposed along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This ridge along the floor of the Atlantic Ocean stretches 10,000 miles from the Arctic to the southern tip of Africa and is part of the longest mountain range on Earth. According to NOAA, mid-ocean ridges like this one are geologically important, since they occur along the type of plate boundary where new ocean floor is created as the plates spread apart.\n\nThe core was uncovered in Spring 2023, during Expedition 399 \"Building Blocks of Life, Atlantis Massif\" aboard the ocean drilling vessel JOIDES Resolution. According to the team, the rocks will hopefully help unravel mysteries about the mantle's role in the origins of life on Earth, how volcanic activity is generated when parts of the mantle melt, and how it drives the global cycles of crucial elements including hydrogen and carbon.\n\nThe team was led by the International Ocean Discovery Program. This international marine research consortium over 20 countries retrieves sediment cores. These cylindrical samples of rock, sand, and other sediment from the ocean floor are like a timeline of our planet's history. Since the core was drilled, the expedition team has been compiling an inventory of the mantle rocks to better understand their composition, structure, and context.\n\n\"When we recovered the rocks last year, it was a major achievement in the history of the Earth sciences, but, more than that, its value is in what the cores of mantle rocks could tell us about the makeup and evolution of our planet,\" Johan Lissenberg, study co-author and geologist at Cardiff University in Wales, said in a statement. \"Our study begins to look at the composition of the mantle by documenting the mineralogy of the recovered rocks, as well as their chemical makeup.\"\n\nAccording to Lissenberg, the results were quite different than they expected. There was less of the mineral pyroxene and higher concentrations of magnesium in the rock. Both of these results from a higher amount of melting than the team would have predicted. This melting occurred as the mantle rose up from the deeper parts of the Earth towards the surface. The results from further analysis of this process could have implications for understanding how magma is formed and leads to volcanism.\n\n\"We also found channels through which melt was transported through the mantle, and so we are able to track the fate of magma after it is formed and travels upwards to the Earth's surface,\" said Lissenberg. \"This is important because it tells us how the mantle melts and feeds volcanoes, particularly those on the ocean floor that account for the majority of volcanism on Earth. Having access to these mantle rocks will allow us to make the connection between the volcanoes and the ultimate source of their magmas.\"\n\n[Related: See 24,000 years of climate history at a glance.]\n\nAdditionally, this early study of the core has initial results on how an abundant mineral in mantle rock called olivine reacts with salty seawater. This process leads to a series of chemical reactions that generate hydrogen and other molecules that can fuel life. Scientists believe that this might have been one of the key processes that spurred life on Earth.\n\n\"The rocks that were present on early Earth bear a closer resemblance to those we retrieved during this expedition than the more common rocks that make up our continents today,\" study co-author and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution geologist Susan Q. Lang said in a statement. \"Analyzing them gives us a critical view into the chemical and physical environments that would have been present early in Earth's history, and that could have provided a consistent source of fuel and favorable conditions over geologically long timeframes to have hosted the earliest forms of life.\"", "source": {"uri": "popsci.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Popular Science"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laura_baisas@popsci.com", "name": "Laura Baisas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_mantle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth's mantle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mantle (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabed", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seabed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_sample", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Core sample"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Magma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rock (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-ocean_ridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mid-ocean ridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tectonics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tectonics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Andreas_Fault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Andreas Fault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volcanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crust (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mountain range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arctic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_Ridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mid-Atlantic Ridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earthquake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woods_Hole_Oceanographic_Institution", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Geology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Geology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Geochemistry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Geochemistry", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Geology,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Geology, Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.popsci.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sediment-core.png?w=2000", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802350", "eventUri": "eng-9802350", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 501, "textEnd": 509}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 229, "relevance": 1}

history'", "body": "Record-breaking rocks from Earth's mantle 'could reveal planet's history'\n\nNina Massey, PA Science Correspondent\n\n8 August 2024 at 8:00 pm\n\nA record-breaking recovery of rocks that originated deep in Earth could reveal secrets of the planet's history, new research suggests.\n\nScientists have recovered the first long section of rocks that originated in the Earth's mantle, the layer below the crust and the planet's largest component.\n\nAt a nearly continuous 1,268 metres, the depth to which the researchers penetrated the mantle rocks beats the previous deepest hole (200 metres) by more than six times, they say.\n\nThe researchers suggest the rocks recovered from the mantle bear a closer resemblance to those that were present on early Earth rather than the more common rocks that make up the continents today.\n\nThe rocks will help to explain what role the mantle played in the origins of life on Earth, and the volcanic activity generated when it melts.\n\nAccording to the team, which includes researchers from Cardiff University, the sample will also help to shed light on how the mantle drives the global cycles of important elements such as carbon and hydrogen.\n\nThe rock was recovered from a tectonic window, a section of the seabed where rocks from the mantle were exposed along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, during Expedition 399 \"Building Blocks of Life, Atlantis Massif\" of the ocean drilling vessel JOIDES Resolution in Spring 2023.\n\nLead author Professor Johan Lissenberg from Cardiff University's School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, said: \"When we recovered the rocks last year, it was a major achievement in the history of the Earth sciences, but, more than that, its value is in what the cores of mantle rocks could tell us about the makeup and evolution of our planet.\n\n\"Our study begins to look at the composition of the mantle by documenting the mineralogy of the recovered rocks, as well as their chemical makeup.\"\n\nWith attempts dating back to the early 1960s, the recovery was led by the International Ocean Discovery Programme, an international marine research group of more than 20 countries that retrieves cores - cylindrical samples of sediment and rock - from the ocean floor to study Earth's history.\n\nSince then, the expedition team has been compiling an inventory of the recovered mantle rocks.\n\nPresented in the journal Science, the findings reveal a more extensive history of melting in the recovered rocks than expected.\n\nProf Lissenberg said: \"Our results differ from what we expected.\n\n\"There is a lot less of the mineral pyroxene in the rocks, and the rocks have got very high concentrations of magnesium, both of which results from much higher amounts of melting than what we would have predicted.\"\n\nThis melting happened as the mantle rose from the deeper parts of the Earth towards the surface.\n\nFurther analysis could have major implications for the understanding of how magma is formed and leads to volcanism, the researchers suggest.\n\nThe study also provides initial results on how an abundant mineral in mantle rocks, called olivine, reacts with seawater, leading to a series of chemical reactions that produce hydrogen and other molecules that can fuel life.\n\nScientists believe this might have been one of the underpinning processes in the origins of life on Earth.\n\nDr Susan Q Lang, an associate scientist in Geology and Geophysics at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who was a co-chief scientist on the expedition, said: \"The rocks that were present on early Earth bear a closer resemblance to those we retrieved during this expedition than the more common rocks that make up our continents today.\n\n\"Analysing them gives us a critical view into the chemical and physical environments that would have been present early in Earth's history, and that could have provided a consistent source of fuel and favourable conditions over geologically long timeframes to have hosted the earliest forms of life.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nina_massey@aol.co.uk",

suggests.\n\nScientists have recovered the first long section of rocks that originated in the Earth's mantle, the layer below the crust and the planet's largest component.\n\nAt a nearly continuous 1,268 metres, the depth to which the researchers penetrated the mantle rocks beats the previous deepest hole (200 metres) by more than six times, they say.\n\nWhen we recovered the rocks last year, it was a major achievement in the history of the Earth sciences Professor Johan Lissenberg\n\nThe researchers suggest the rocks recovered from the mantle bear a closer resemblance to those that were present on early Earth rather than the more common rocks that make up the continents today.\n\nThe rocks will help to explain what role the mantle played in the origins of life on Earth, and the volcanic activity generated when it melts.\n\nAccording to the team, which includes researchers from Cardiff University, the sample will also help to shed light on how the mantle drives the global cycles of important elements such as carbon and hydrogen.\n\nA record-breaking recovery of rocks that originated deep in Earth could reveal secrets of the planet\u00b4s history, new research suggests (Johan Lissenberg/PA)\n\nThe rock was recovered from a tectonic window, a section of the seabed where rocks from the mantle were exposed along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, during Expedition 399 \"Building Blocks of Life, Atlantis Massif\" of the ocean drilling vessel JOIDES Resolution in Spring 2023.\n\nLead author Professor Johan Lissenberg from Cardiff University's School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, said: \"When we recovered the rocks last year, it was a major achievement in the history of the Earth sciences, but, more than that, its value is in what the cores of mantle rocks could tell us about the makeup and evolution of our planet.\n\n\"Our study begins to look at the composition of the mantle by documenting the mineralogy of the recovered rocks, as well as their chemical makeup.\"\n\nWith attempts dating back to the early 1960s, the recovery was led by the International Ocean Discovery Programme, an international marine research group of more than 20 countries that retrieves cores - cylindrical samples of sediment and rock - from the ocean floor to study Earth's history.\n\nSince then, the expedition team has been compiling an inventory of the recovered mantle rocks.\n\nPresented in the journal Science, the findings reveal a more extensive history of melting in the recovered rocks than expected.\n\nProf Lissenberg said: \"Our results differ from what we expected.\n\n\"There is a lot less of the mineral pyroxene in the rocks, and the rocks have got very high concentrations of magnesium, both of which results from much higher amounts of melting than what we would have predicted.\"\n\nThis melting happened as the mantle rose from the deeper parts of the Earth towards the surface.\n\nFurther analysis could have major implications for the understanding of how magma is formed and leads to volcanism, the researchers suggest.\n\nThe study also provides initial results on how an abundant mineral in mantle rocks, called olivine, reacts with seawater, leading to a series of chemical reactions that produce hydrogen and other molecules that can fuel life.\n\nScientists believe this might have been one of the underpinning processes in the origins of life on Earth.\n\nDr Susan Q Lang, an associate scientist in Geology and Geophysics at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who was a co-chief scientist on the expedition, said: \"The

Having access to these mantle rocks will allow us to make the connection between the volcanoes and the ultimate source of their magmas.\"\n\nThe study also provides initial results on how olivine, an abundant mineral in mantle rocks, reacts with seawater, leading to a series of chemical reactions that produce hydrogen and other molecules that can fuel life.\n\nScientists believe this might have been one of the underpinning processes in the origin of life on Earth.\n\nDr Susan Q Lang, an associate scientist in Geology and Geophysics at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who was a co-chief scientist on the expedition and part of a team continuing to analyse rock and fluid samples, said: \"The rocks that were present on early Earth bear a closer resemblance to those we retrieved during this expedition than the more common rocks that make up our continents today.\n\n\"Analysing them gives us a critical view into the chemical and physical environments that would have been present early in Earth's history, and that could have provided a consistent source of fuel and favorable conditions over geologically long timeframes to have hosted the earliest forms of life.\"\n\nThe international team of more than 30 scientists from the JOIDES Resolution expedition will continue their research on the recovered drill cores to address a wide range of problems.\n\nDr. Andrew McCaig, an Associate Professor in the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds, who was the lead proponent of Expedition 399 and a co-chief scientist on the Expedition added: \"Everyone involved in Expedition 399, starting with the first proposal in 2018, can be proud of the achievements documented in this paper. Our new deep hole will be a type section for decades to come in disciplines as diverse as melting processes in the mantle, chemical exchange between rocks and the ocean, organic geochemistry and microbiology.

Mantle rocks generally are inaccessible except where they are exposed at locations of seafloor spreading between the slowly moving continent-sized plates that make up the planet's surface.\n\nOne such place is the Atlantis Massif, an underwater mountain where mantle rock is exposed on the seafloor. It is located in the middle of the Atlantic just west of the vast mid-Atlantic Ridge that forms the boundary between the North American plate and the Eurasian and African plates.\n\nUsing equipment aboard the vessel Joides Resolution, the researchers drilled into mantle rock about 850m beneath the ocean surface from April to June 2023. The core sample they recovered comprises more than 70 per cent of the rock - 886m in length - from the hole they drilled.\n\n\"The recovery is record-breaking in that previous attempts of drilling mantle rocks have been difficult, with penetration no deeper than 200m and with relatively low recovery of rocks. In contrast, we penetrated 1,268m, recovering large sections of continuous mantle rocks,\" said geologist Johan Lissenberg of Cardiff University in Wales, lead author of the study published in the journal Science.\n\n\"Previously, we have been largely limited to mantle samples dredged from the seafloor,\" Dr Lissenberg added.\n\nThe core sample has a diameter of about 6.5cm.\n\n\"We did have quite a bit of difficulty starting our hole,\" said geologist and study co-author Andrew McCaig of the University of Leeds in England.\n\nThe researchers added a reinforced concrete cylinder lining to the uppermost part of the hole, Dr McCaig said, \"and then drilled unexpectedly easily.\"\n\nThey documented how a mineral called olivine in the core sample had reacted with seawater at various temperatures.\n\n\"The reaction between seawater and mantle rocks on or near the seafloor releases hydrogen, which in turn forms compounds such as methane, which underpin microbial life. This is one of the hypotheses for the origin of life on Earth,\" Dr Lissenberg said.\n\n\"Our recovery of mantle rocks enables us to study these reactions in great detail and across a range of temperatures, and link it to the observations our microbiologists make on the abundance and types of microbes present in the rocks, and the depth to which microbes occur beneath the ocean floor,\" Dr

This layer, hidden beneath the crust, forms the largest chunk of our planet.\n\nThe insights gained from this discovery open doors to a profound understanding of our planet's inner workings, offering a peek into life's origins, the causes behind volcanic activities, and the global cycles of elements vital to our existence such as carbon and hydrogen.\n\nThe Earth is composed of four primary layers: the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core. At the surface, we find the crust, which is thin and solid, primarily made of rock, representing the layer where we reside.\n\nBelow the crust lies the mantle, a substantial layer of semi-solid rock that flows gradually over time. This dynamic layer is crucial, as it drives the movement of tectonic plates, resulting in earthquakes and volcanic activity.\n\nDelving deeper, the outer core consists of liquid metal, predominantly iron and nickel, and is responsible for generating Earth's magnetic field through its movements.\n\nAt the very center, we encounter the inner core -- a dense, solid sphere of iron and nickel. Despite enduring extreme heat, the extraordinary pressure keeps this inner core solid.\n\nEach layer not only contributes to the structure of our planet but also plays a vital role in processes that shape our environment.\n\nAt the forefront of this remarkable feat is Professor Johan Lissenberg from Cardiff University's School of Earth and Environmental Sciences.\n\nThe mantle rocks were procured from a tectonic window on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge during Expedition 399 of the JOIDES Resolution, appropriately titled \"Building Blocks of Life, Atlantis Massif,\" in spring of 2023.\n\nThis accomplishment marks an epoch in Earth sciences. The international team, operating under the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP), has secured these ancient rocks for detailed analysis. They will now serve as keys to our understanding of Earth's geological and biological history.\n\nThe rock samples are far from ordinary. Their unique makeup reveals secrets of processes that took place as these rocks ascended from the deep recesses of the Earth to the surface.\n\nProfessor Lissenberg notes, \"Our study begins to look at the composition of the mantle by documenting the mineralogy of the recovered rocks, as well as their chemical makeup.\"\n\nInterestingly, they contain less of the mineral pyroxene and more magnesium than anticipated. This points to the mantle undergoing considerably more melting than previously believed, which in turn, helps explain how magma forms and eventually leads to volcanic eruptions.\n\nPathways discovered within these rock samples indicate the routes magma took towards the Earth's surface.\n\nThese revelations underscore a better understanding of how magma originates in the mantle, moves upwards, and eventually powers volcanic eruptions.\n\n\"This is important because it tells us how the mantle melts and feeds volcanoes, particularly those on the ocean floor that account for the majority of volcanism on Earth,\" explains Professor Lissenberg.\n\nUnderstanding this interplay between mantle melting and volcanic activity is a critical piece in Earth's geological puzzle.\n\nThe mantle rocks offer key insights not just into geological processes, but also into how life on Earth might have originated.\n\nThe mineral olivine, abundant in mantle rocks, reacts with seawater to produce hydrogen and other molecules - a process potentially fundamental to the creation of early life conditions.\n\nDr. Susan Q. Lang from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution underscores the importance of this breakthrough.\n\n\"The rocks that were present on early Earth bear a closer resemblance to those we retrieved during this expedition than the more common rocks that make up our continents today,\" she shares.\n\nThis discovery offers a glimpse into conditions billions of years ago.\n\nThe journey of the Expedition 399 team is far from complete. The international group, comprised of more than 30 scientists, will continue to examine the mantle samples to unravel a myriad of scientific mysteries.\n\nDr. Andrew McCaig, the co-chief scientist of the expedition from the University of Leeds, sheds light on the extensive implications of this research.\n\n\"Our new deep hole will be a type section for decades to come in disciplines as diverse as melting processes in the mantle, chemical exchange between rocks and the ocean, organic geochemistry, and microbiology,\" McCaig concluded.\n\nThe recovery of mantle rocks from the ocean's depths is not just a landmark scientific achievement; it's a giant leap towards untangling the intricate mysteries of our planet.\n\nAs scientists like Professor Lissenberg, Dr. Lang, Dr. McCaig, and their colleagues continue to delve into the data, they're not just increasing our understanding of Earth; they're also reshaping our perception of our planet and our place within it.\n\nIt is awe-inspiring to realize that somewhere, deep beneath our feet, the answers to some of life's grandest questions lay shrouded in mystery.\n\nThe team's relentless pursuit of knowledge, their spirit of collaboration, and their unending curiosity serves as a reminder of scientific exploration's endless potential.\n\nLike what you read?

Such processes, they said, may have underpinned the advent of life on Earth billions of years ago.\n\nThe mantle, comprising more than 80% of the planet's volume, is a layer of silicate rock sandwiched between Earth's outer crust and ferociously hot core. Mantle rocks generally are inaccessible except where they are exposed at locations of seafloor spreading between the slowly moving continent-sized plates that make up the planet's surface.\n\nOne such place is the Atlantis Massif, an underwater mountain where mantle rock is exposed on the seafloor. It is located in the middle of the Atlantic just west of the vast mid-Atlantic Ridge that forms the boundary between the North American plate and the Eurasian and African plates.\n\nUsing equipment aboard the vessel JOIDES Resolution, the researchers drilled into mantle rock about 2,800 feet (850 meters) beneath the ocean surface from April to June 2023. The core sample they recovered comprises more than 70% of the rock - 2,907 feet (886 meters) in length - from the hole they drilled.\n\n\"The recovery is record-breaking in that previous attempts of drilling mantle rocks have been difficult, with penetration no deeper than 200 meters (656 feet) and with relatively low recovery of rocks. In contrast, we penetrated 1,268 meters, recovering large sections of continuous mantle rocks,\" said geologist Johan Lissenberg of Cardiff University in Wales, lead author of the study published in the journal Science.\n\n\"Previously, we have been largely limited to mantle samples dredged from the seafloor,\" Lissenberg added.\n\nThe core sample has a diameter of about 2-1/2 inches (6.5 cm).\n\n\"We did have quite a bit of difficulty starting our hole,\" said geologist and study co-author Andrew McCaig of the University of Leeds in England.\n\nThe researchers added a reinforced concrete cylinder lining to the uppermost part of the hole, McCaig said, \"and then drilled unexpectedly easily.\"\n\nThey documented how a mineral called olivine in the core sample had reacted with seawater at various temperatures.\n\n\"The reaction between seawater and mantle rocks on or near the seafloor releases hydrogen, which in turn forms compounds such as methane, which underpin microbial life. This is one of the hypotheses for the origin of life on Earth,\" Lissenberg said.\n\n\"Our recovery of mantle rocks enables us to study these reactions in great detail and across a range of temperatures, and link it to the observations our microbiologists make on the abundance and types of microbes present in the rocks, and the depth to which microbes occur beneath the ocean floor,\" Lissenberg added.\n\nThe drill site was located close to the Lost City Hydrothermal Field, an area of hydrothermal vents on the seabed spurting super-heated water. The core sample is thought to be representative of the mantle rock beneath the Lost City vents.\n\n\"One suggestion for the origin of life on Earth is that it could have happened in an environment similar to Lost City,\" McCaig said.\n\nThe core sample is still being analyzed. The researchers made some preliminary findings about its composition and documented a more extensive history of melting - molten rock - than expected.\n\n\"The mineral orthopyroxene in particular showed a wide range of abundance on a range of scales, from the centimeter to hundreds of meters,\" Lissenberg said. \"We relate this to the flow of melt through the upper mantle. As the upper mantle rises up beneath the spreading plates, it melts, and this melt migrates up towards the surface to feed volcanoes.\"\n\n(Reporting by Will Dunham, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mantle (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_sample", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Core sample"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabed", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seabed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rock (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seawater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_mantle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth's mantle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis_Massif", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantis Massif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafloor_spreading", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seafloor spreading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silicate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seamount", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seamount"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_drilling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offshore drilling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crust (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Plate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African Plate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JOIDES_Resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JOIDES Resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Plate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North American Plate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eurasia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dredging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dredging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cardiff University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microorganism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Leeds", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Leeds"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Geology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Geology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Geochemistry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Geochemistry", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand_Games/Rock,_Paper,_Scissors", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand Games/Rock, Paper, Scissors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Resolers", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Resolers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters.com/d57cad6f4e6b44abe6a28e63da53f344", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802350", "eventUri": "eng-9802350", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Analysis of the resulting rock core offers fresh clues about the evolution of our planet's outermost layers, and perhaps even the origins of life.\n\nEarth is broadly made up of a few different layers, including a solid outer crust, an upper and lower mantle and a core. The upper mantle, which sits just below the crust, is composed primarily of a magnesium-rich rock called peridotite. This layer drives key planetary processes such as earthquakes, the water cycle and the formation of volcanoes and mountains.\n\n\"To date, we've only had access to fragments of the mantle,\" says Johan Lissenberg at Cardiff University, UK. \"But there are a number of places where the mantle is exposed on the seafloor.\"\n\nOne of these areas is an underwater mountain located called Atlantis Massif, located near a volcanically active region of the mid-Atlantic ridge. Continuously surfacing and melting parts of the mantle give rise to many of the volcanoes in the area. Meanwhile, as seawater seeps deeper into the mantle, the hotter temperatures heat it up and produce chemical compounds such as methane, which bubble back up through hydrothermal vents and provide fuel for microbial life.\n\n\"There's a kind of chemical kitchen in the subsurface of Atlantis Massif,\" says Lissenberg.\n\nTo learn more about this dynamic region, he and his colleagues initially planned to bore 200 metres into the mantle with the drilling ship JOIDES Resolution, deeper than researchers had ever managed so far.\n\n\"Then we started drilling and things went amazingly well,\" says team member Andrew McCaig at the University of Leeds, UK. \"We recovered really long sections of continuous rocks and decided to stick with it and go as deep as we could.\"\n\nEventually, the team managed to dig 1268 metres down into the mantle.\n\nUpon analysing the drill core sample, the researchers found that it had much lower levels of a mineral called pyroxene compared with other mantle samples collected from around the world. That suggests this particular section of the mantle has undergone significant melting in the past, which has depleted the pyroxene, says Lissenberg.\n\nIn the future, he hopes to reconstruct this melting process, which could help us understand how the mantle melts and how that molten rock migrates to the surface to feed oceanic volcanoes.\n\nSome scientists think life on Earth began in the depths of the ocean near hydrothermal vents. So, by examining the chemicals that appear along the cylindrical rock core, microbiologists are hoping to determine the conditions that may have led to life and how deep beneath the ocean floor they occurred.\n\n\"It's a very important drill hole because it's going to be a reference section for scientists from many branches of science,\" says McCaig.\n\n\"A one-dimensional sample of the Earth cannot provide full information on the three-dimensional migration pathways of melt and water, but is nevertheless a major achievement,\" says John Wheeler at the University of Liverpool, UK.", "source": {"uri": "newscientist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Scientist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_mantle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth's mantle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abiogenesis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mantle (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Volcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabed", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seabed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crust (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_mantle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lower mantle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_mantle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upper mantle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis_Massif", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantis Massif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_drilling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scientific drilling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lithosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peridotite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peridotite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_sample", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Core sample"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earthquake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cardiff University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Leeds", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Leeds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Liverpool", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Liverpool"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Geology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Geology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Geology,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Geology, Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/08105403/SEI_216466276.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802350", "eventUri": "eng-9802350", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Previous efforts to drill into mantle rocks brought to the surface in the deep sea had reached only 659 feet (201 meters) -- not deep enough to look for organisms such as heat-loving bacteria that might dwell farther down, said Gordon Southam, a geomicrobiologist at the University of Queensland in Australia and a co-author of a new study describing the core sample.\n\n\"Every time the drillers recovered another section of deep core, the microbiology team collected samples to culture bacteria to determine the limits of life in this deep subsurface marine ecosystem,\" Southam wrote in an email to Live Science. \"Our ultimate goal is to improve our understanding of the origins of life and to define the potential for life beyond Earth.\"\n\nRelated: 'Dragon' and 'tree of life' hydrothermal vents discovered in Arctic region scientists thought was geologically dead\n\nThe rock core can also answer questions about the movement of the mantle, said Johan Lissenberg, a geochemist at the University of Cardiff in the U.K. and first author of the study, published today (Aug. 8) in the journal Science. \"We know from the rocks that erupt in oceanic volcanoes that the mantle has a lot of different 'flavors,'\" Lissenberg told Live Science. These \"flavors\" are varying rock compositions that come from the recycling of tectonic plates into Earth's interior.\n\nWith the new mantle sample, \"we can really try to see what flavors have we got and on what scale do they vary,\" Lissenberg said, \"and then reconstruct how those different bits of the mantle melted and then how they migrated towards the surface.\"\n\nSo far, the team has found that rather than traveling vertically, melts seem to move obliquely, traveling in a diagonal, inclined path toward the surface, Lissenberg said.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Image 1 of 3\n\nThe core was drilled by the International Ocean Discovery Program in 2023.

The spot drilled was near the \"Lost City,\" a hydrothermal vent field crowded with beehive- and tower-shaped structures that release methane and hydrogen into the ocean.

That's why a group of researchers undertook a difficult undertaking: digging a hole over three-quarters of a mile deep and extracting a record-breaking core of rock from the Earth's mantle.\n\nScientists regularly extract core samples -- cylindrical samples of material from deep under the Earth's surface -- to examine the composition of different layers. That data can act as a window into the planet's past, providing information on climatic and environmental shifts, or the formation of Earth itself. Drilling in the deep sea comes with unique challenges, so researchers have often been forced to dredge rocks from the ocean floor. Analyzing the composition of those rocks can reveal valuable information, but these rocks can be altered by the pressure of the sea and by exposure to salt water.\n\nThe expedition took place between April and June 2023 in an area of the North Atlantic known as the Atlantis Massif, an underwater mountain that rises 14,000 feet (4,267 meters) from the seafloor. The site was selected because tectonic activity in the area thrusts rocks that are normally deep in the Earth's mantle far closer to the ocean floor, making them easier to recover. That still required some deep drilling to obtain a 4,160-foot-long (1,268 meters) near-continuous core of peridotite, a type of igneous rock.\n\nThis extreme depth is far greater than any previous attempts to drill into oceanic mantle rocks. According to the study, co-authored by C. Johan Lissenberg from Cardiff University, the scientists managed to recover 71% of the drilled material, with nearly complete recovery of long sections of partially serpentinized harzburgite (that is, partially water-altered rock).\n\nAs noted in the paper, published in the journal Science, the researchers analyzed the composition of minerals within the rock and found evidence supporting a theory of how rocks born deep in the mantle rise to the surface. In that theory, pressure melts rocks that are then pressed upwards, mixing with magma in the crust before erupting on the ocean floor.\n\nThe researchers also found intrusions of a crystalline rock called gabbro, which is formed by the slow cooling of magma. They believe the gabbro plays a major role in regulating the minerals and gasses found in deep sea vents, which some scientists believe are an ideal home for the formation of primitive life. Learning more about the vents could lead to new theories on how life on Earth first began, and how it could theoretically form on other planets.\n\nIn the study, the researchers acknowledged much more analysis on what they drilled needs to be done. \"The comprehensive rock record obtained during Expedition 399 provides a wealth of opportunities to make fundamental advances on our understanding of the oceanic upper mantle,\" they said.\n\nIn an accompanying article, Utrecht University professor Eric Hellebrand said the \"depth far exceeds those recorded in previous drilling efforts and creates opportunities to discern structural and mineralogical features of the mantle and how it interacts with the hydro- and biospheres.\"\n\nHe also expressed hope that the drilling expedition could raise the bar for the study of how the Earth was formed.\n\n\"Decades of ocean floor sampling by dredging have painted a rough mineralogical picture of mantle,\" he wrote. \"Yet, each new drilling mission reveals surprising views of mantle and formation of the oceanic crust. More ambitious drilling projects will reveal important pieces to understand the biogeochemical effects of oceanic mantle.\"", "source": {"uri": "gizmodo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gizmodo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_kovac@gizmodo.com", "name": "Adam Kovac", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_mantle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth's mantle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabed", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seabed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rock (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mineral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deep sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_sample", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Core sample"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harzburgite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harzburgite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis_Massif", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlantis Massif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lithosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peridotite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peridotite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpentinite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serpentinite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabbro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gabbro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igneous_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Igneous rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seamount", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seamount"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mantle (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dredging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dredging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Geology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Geology", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Oceanography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Oceanography", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Water_Wells_and_Pumps", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Water Wells and Pumps", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Education", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Education", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/08/atlantic-core-sample-seafloor.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802350", "eventUri": "eng-9802350", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Now, the first analysis of those rocks, published today in , hints at their potential to shed light on Earth's fundamental processes, such as how magma charges volcanic eruptions and how new crust is formed at plate boundaries. Analysis of the rocks, which contain tantalizing hints of microbial activity, might even help researchers understand what ignited the first sparks of life.\n\n\"Previously we had snapshots of these processes,\" says Michael Bizimis, a geochemist at the University of South Carolina who was not part of the study team. But the nearly continuous new core, more than 1 kilometer long, promises unprecedented insights. \"This core is almost like a Rosetta Stone,\" he says.\n\nUnder Earth's continents, the mantle hides roughly 30 kilometers down. So scientists largely see this layer in glimpses, such as fragments belched up in volcanic eruptions. However, ocean crust is only about 7 kilometers thick. This led generations of scientists to attempt to drill through the seabed to retrieve fresh mantle rocks, starting with an ill-fated mission in the late 1950s known as Project Mohole.\n\nAlthough that quest has yet to be realized, last year, scientists onboard the JOIDES Resolution, the flagship of the International Ocean Discovery Program, achieved the next-best thing: recovering an intact core of mantle rocks from a swath of sea floor where the crust is especially thin. Their target was Atlantis Massif, a submarine mountain rising more than 4000 meters from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. The peak formed from tectonic shifts along the nearby Mid-Atlantic Ridge that lifted and rotated a chunk of the surface, stripping away the upper crust and allowing mantle rock to rise unusually close to the sea floor. This put peridotite, a rock type that dominates the upper mantle, within reach of the team's drill. Measuring 1268 meters long, the core they extracted beat the last record holder for mantle rocks by more than 1 kilometer.\n\nThe newly recovered rocks are not pristine. When exposed to seawater, olivine, a green mineral common in mantle rocks, reacts to form the silvery mineral serpentine. Although some sections of the core are as little as 40% altered, others are completely serpentinized. This makes it a challenge to tease out the rocks' hidden stories. It's like reading a child's school report that fell into a puddle -- \"the grades can be deciphered, but details in the accompanying teacher's note are illegible,\" writes Eric Hellebrand, a geologist at Utrecht University, in an accompanying Perspectives article in .\n\nAnalysis of the core's mineral makeup revealed clues to the volcanic activity that takes place at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where tectonic plates separate, allowing mantle rocks to well up and partially melt. Patches of the core are made almost entirely of olivine, which is resistant to melting. These sections likely represent the paths magma took as it percolated up toward the surface. As the melt flowed it dissolved other minerals, except for the durable olivine, explains study author Johan Lissenberg, a petrologist from Cardiff University. Future analyses could help researchers better understand this subsurface mantle plumbing that feeds seafloor volcanoes.\n\nAnother intriguing find from the core hints at the history of the hunk of mantle that rose to form Atlantis Massif. As mantle rocks rise to form volcanoes, not all of their minerals melt at once, leaving so-called depleted rocks behind. The core rocks were even more depleted than expected for fresh mantle rocks from near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Perhaps, the scientists speculate, this wasn't the first time these mantle rocks had risen to the surface. Circulating currents in the mantle recycle rocks in a process Bizimis likens to a washing machine. It's possible the rocks of Atlantis Massif rose millions or even billions of years ago, then melted and became depleted before the chunk cycled around and rose again, the researchers suggest.\n\nThe core is also helping scientists understand the limits of life in extreme environments where there is no light and very few food sources. DNA analyses show microbes had a foothold in the upper sections of the core rocks, says study author Gordon Southam, a geomicrobiologist at the University of Queensland. But carbonate minerals in some samples further hint at the presence of life. Though unexpected in mantle rocks, carbonates commonly form as a byproduct of microbial activity. The samples with carbonates also yielded the most microbial DNA, Southam adds.\n\nWithout light or organic matter, \"All the energy [for life] comes from chemical reactions,\" says study author Marguerite Godard, a geochemist at the University of Montpellier. One of the few energy sources is hydrogen, which forms as a byproduct of serpentinization. This gas may have also been a primary food of Earth's earliest inhabitants. So studying the core might give clues to how life first began on Earth -- or how it might survive on other worlds. \"It's really the start of a new adventure,\" Godard says.\n\nSoutham is eagerly investigating the samples' nickel, which is vital to the function of enzymes required by microbes that use hydrogen as food. He and his colleagues discovered that where there's evidence of serpentinization and hydrogen production, there's also bioavailable nickel. They hope that by mapping the nickel, they can identify the most promising places to find the deep-living microbes.\n\nGodard stresses that the team is still at the very beginning of its analyses. \"It's a book that's just being opened,\" she says. \"We need to start reading it.\"", "source": {"uri": "science.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "science.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mantle (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Magma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabed", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seabed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crust (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microorganism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Volcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mineral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plate tectonics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mohole", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Project Mohole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_mantle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth's mantle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_crust", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth's crust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis_Massif", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantis Massif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_crust", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oceanic crust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpentinite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serpentinite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olivine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rosetta Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_sample", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Core sample"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geochemistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geochemistry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utrecht_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Utrecht University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queensland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queensland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Geology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Geology", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Geochemistry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Geochemistry", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand_Games/Rock,_Paper,_Scissors", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand Games/Rock, Paper, Scissors", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Resolers", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Resolers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.zqpy2e9/abs/_20240808_on_mantlerocks.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802350", "eventUri": "eng-9802350", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

French geologist R\u00e9mi Coltat recalls setting out from the Spanish city of Granada, where he worked at the Andalusian Institute of Earth Sciences, to embark on an epic journey into the Earth's mantle. The U.S. ship JOIDES Resolution set sail from Ponta Delgada, in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores, on April 12, 2023. It stopped in the middle of the North Atlantic and began drilling into the ocean floor, just 800 meters from the Lost City, a strange underwater territory where hydrothermal vents have raised ghostly towers. Coltat recalls the \"screams of joy\" when, in the ship's machinery, rocks from the Earth's mantle began to appear: a column of 1,268 meters, the largest sample ever obtained. Coltat says the discovery is \"a window into the development of life\" on Earth.\n\nDutch geologist Johan Lissenberg led the scientific team. \"One hypothesis for the origin of life is that it depended on reactions between seawater and rocks like the ones we have recovered,\" explains Lissenberg, from Cardiff University in the United Kingdom. These reactions transform the mineral olivine -- predominant in the upper layer of the Earth's mantle -- into serpentine rocks, in a process called serpentinization. \"This releases hydrogen and subsequently compounds such as methane, which create the conditions in which microbial life can thrive,\" says Lissenberg. His expedition was the 399th of the International Ocean Drilling Project Expedition, a 21-country initiative launched a decade ago.\n\nThe Lost City is located in the Atlantis massif, an underwater mountain slightly higher than Mount Teide in Tenerife. The conditions there are extreme: temperatures of over 90\u00baC and very alkaline waters, with carbonate towers reaching 60 meters. The Earth's mantle is at a depth that cannot be accessed with current techniques: normally more than six miles below the Earth's crust. But in the Atlantis massif, it is within reach thanks to the separation of two tectonic plates. \"These are rocks from the mantle that are no longer in the mantle, but that were there recently,\" explains Lissenberg. The historic hole is called U1601C.\n\nThe Dutch researcher believes that the 1,268-meter-long rock column, combined with samples of fluids from hydrothermal vents, is \"the best window\" to study this hypothetical origin of life on Earth. The team's microbiologists are determining the quantity and type of microbes in the recovered rocks, as well as the depth at which they are found. \"We can combine the microbiological findings with those from serpentinization, to understand the factors that control microbial life in rocks derived from the mantle,\" says Lissenberg. Their results were published on Thursday in the journal Science.\n\nR\u00e9mi Coltat spent two months aboard the JOIDES Resolution, a 143-metre-long research vessel capable of drilling at depths of over five miles. It is like a small floating village, with more than a hundred inhabitants, including scientists, sailors, cooks and other crew members. \"The drilling goes on 24 hours a day. We worked in 12-hour shifts. When we finished, we went to sleep and resumed the task the next day. It was very exciting when something new appeared,\" recalls Coltat, who left Granada a few days ago to join the Institute of Earth Sciences in Orleans, France.\n\nColtat, 30, recalls that the previous record was obtained with just a 200-meter borehole in mantle rocks on an expedition led three decades ago by the French geologist Mathilde Cannat. Last year, the scientists on board the JOIDES Resolution never dreamed of going so far. \"It was incredible when we saw that we could drill so well,\" recalls Coltat.\n\nGeologist Juan Manuel Garc\u00eda Ruiz, from Spain's Donostia International Physics Center, has just received \u20ac10 million from the EU to investigate the role of silica -- a mineral made up of silicon and oxygen -- in the appearance of living beings. In his opinion, the most remarkable thing about the new study is not its possible clues about the origin of life, but that it will help to determine the origin of methane in these environments: whether it comes from bacteria or from serpentinization reactions.\n\nGerman researcher Manuel Dominik Menzel, from the Andalusian Institute of Earth Sciences, points out that understanding the upper part of the Earth's mantle is essential to understanding processes such as magmatism and the formation of the continents themselves. Menzel studies how the mantle naturally reacts with water and carbon dioxide (CO\u2082). When it interacts, it forms minerals and the CO\u2082 is fixed, a phenomenon that in the future could serve to capture the gas from the atmosphere and keep it underground.\n\nMenzel applauds the new work, in which he was not involved. \"It is a great success to carry out such a deep survey. I am very surprised that they have seen so much serpentinization, which is the percentage of water that enters the rock of the mantle,\" he says. The German geologist points out that in hydrothermal sources there is energy and different chemical compounds, as well as rocks from the mantle and magmatic rocks from the crust -- the so-called gabbro -- , which has another chemical recipe. \"When they mix, there is more potential to produce very diverse conditions that can give rise to life,\" he says.", "source": {"uri":

The samples, described on 8 August in Science, offer unprecedented insights into processes that lead to the crust's formation.\n\n\"We had that story in our head\" about what this kind of rock should look like, but it's completely different when \"you see it there on a table\", says Natsue Abe, a petrologist at the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology in Yokohama.\n\nThe expedition's achievements are a \"fantastic landmark\", says Rosalind Coggon, a marine geologist at the University of Southampton, UK. \"Ocean drilling provides the only access to samples of Earth's deep interior that are key to understanding our planet's formation and evolution.\"\n\nGeoscientists worry that it will be a long time until they can follow up with more studies, because the decade-long International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) is coming to an end, and the United States is retiring its workhorse research ship, JOIDES Resolution.\n\nOceanic crust -- the type of crust found mainly underneath Earth's seas, rather than its continents -- is mostly made up of dense, volcanic rock called basalt. It is much thinner and younger than continental crust, because the rocks are recycled continually by the movements of tectonic plates.\n\nBasalt forms when magma pushes up through undersea cracks along formations called mid-oceanic ridges. The magma itself originates from a process called partial melting in the mantle -- which is largely made up of translucent-green, magnesium-rich minerals. As material in the mantle rises, the pressure over it drops, which causes some of these minerals to melt and form microscopic films of magma between rock crystals.\n\nUsually, only magma erupts onto the sea floor. But at some sites, mantle rock also makes it to the surface, where it interacts with sea water in a reaction called serpentinization. This alters the rock's structure -- giving it a marble-like appearance -- and releases various substances, including hydrogen.\n\nIn May 2023, JOIDES Resolution was visiting a site where this has happened: an undersea mountain called the Atlantis Massif, located just west of the Atlantic's mid-ocean ridge. The 143-metre-long ship is equipped with a 62-metre-tall crane for undersea drilling.\n\nThe researchers on board chose to drill at Lost City, a site on the southern side of the massif. The region is punctuated with hydrothermal vents where extremophile microorganisms feed on the hydrogen that seeps out.\n\n\"We had only planned to drill for 200 metres, because that was the deepest people had ever managed to drill in mantle rock,\" says Johan Lissenberg, a petrologist at Cardiff University, UK. But the drilling was surprisingly easy and three times faster than usual, returning long, unbroken cylinders of rock called cores. \"So, we just decided to keep going,\" says Lissenberg. The team stopped only when the expedition was coming to its scheduled end.\n\nThe researchers have now published their initial findings. \"What we report is literally what you can do on the ship. A team of 30 scientists poring over the cores 24 hours a day for two months, and logging centimetre by centimetre as it's coming up.\"\n\nWhen the scientists examined the structure of the rock in detail, they observed 'oblique features', a telltale signature of the prevailing theory of how magma separates from the mantle to become part of the crust, says Lissenberg. The mantle rock was also interspersed with other types of rock in the cores, suggesting that the mantle-crust boundary is not as sharp as seismographic data normally suggest, says Jessica Warren, a geochemist at the University of Delaware in Newark. Together, these results \"are key to how we understand the formation of tectonic plates in the oceans\", she says.\n\nThe trip capped a worthy four-decade career for the JOIDES Resolution, which the US National Science Foundation (NSF) had been renting from a private company. But the NSF has announced that it can no longer afford the US$72 million per year that it costs to run the ship after it fulfilled its IODP obligations, and that the programme would be discontinued. This leaves some scientists, especially those at early career stages, uncertain about the future of the field, says Aled Evans, a marine geologist at the University of Southampton.\n\nOne remaining 'grand challenge' for geoscientists is to drill through the basaltic layer and across the boundary between crust and mantle -- called the Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 discontinuity or 'Moho'. This would allow them to access pristine mantle rock that hasn't reacted with seawater. \"We haven't drilled into the real mantle yet,\" says Abe. The unexpectedly smooth drilling at Lost City bodes well for those future attempts, which could be carried out by Japan's research ship Chiky\u016b, she adds. \"Mantle rocks are the most common part of our entire planet,\" says Evans. \"Sampling them would tell us something fundamental about what our planet is made of.\"", "source": {"uri": "nature.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nature"},

The findings reveal new insights into mantle composition, Earth's deep geology, and the potential biogeochemical conditions involved in the origins of life. Understanding the Earth's mantle is crucial for comprehending important details of the Earth system, including terrestrial magmatism, crust formation, and the cycling of elements between the planet's interior, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere. Much of what is known is based on rocks dredged off the ocean floor. However, these samples often lack critical geological context and are subject to altered mineralogy due to igneous processes and seafloor weathering, including serpentinization. Although rock cores of abyssal peridotites - the primary rock of Earth's upper mantle - can provide a continuous record, drilling the kilometer-deep holes required to obtain them has proved challenging.\n\nNow, Johan Lissenberg and colleagues report the recovery and characterization of a nearly continuous 1268-meter-long drill core of serpentinized abyssal mantle peridotite from the mid-Atlantic ridge. The drill core was collected in 2023 during the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 399, from a hydrothermally active region called the Atlantis Massif. Lissenberg et al. documented significant mineralogical variations throughout the core at various scales, including in levels of serpentinization. The sample's pyroxene content was also unexpectedly low compared to other abyssal peridotite samples worldwide, which could be due to high degrees of depletion and pyroxene dissolution during melt flow. And, contrary to common models, melt migration was found to be oblique to mantle upwelling. The authors observed hydrothermal fluid-rock interaction throughout the core, with oxidative weathering down to 200 meters. Gabbroic intrusions were also discovered to play an unexpected role in hydrothermal alteration and in regulating fluid compositions from peridotite-hosted hydrothermal vents, which have been proposed as models of environments where prebiotic chemistry may have led to the development of life on early Earth and other planetary bodies. \"Decades of ocean floor sampling by dredging have painted a rough mineralogical picture of mantle. Yet, each new drilling mission reveals surprising views of mantle and formation of the oceanic crust,\" writes Eric Hellebrand in a related Perspective. \"More ambitious drilling projects will reveal important pieces to understand the biogeochemical effects of oceanic mantle.\"\n\n/Public Release.

Made up of igneous rock that has been chemically altered by seawater in a process known as serpentinization, the cylinder has now been analyzed and its secrets revealed.\n\nThis thread of Earth-skin, extracted from the ocean depths, is a repository of information that can be used to plumb Earth's mysterious mantle, the layer of solid volcanic rock that separates the crust from the core.\n\n\"We recovered a 1268-meter-long section of serpentinized oceanic mantle peridotite,\" writes a team led by petrologist and geochemist Johan Lissenberg of Cardiff University in the UK.\n\n\"The nearly continuous recovery provides an opportunity to obtain a robust and quantitative lithological, mineralogical, structural, and alteration inventory of the upper mantle.\"\n\nEarth's mantle, to we surface-crawlers, is frustratingly out of reach. At its thinnest, Earth's crust is 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) thick.\n\nWe do have the tools to drill down pretty deep from the continental surface - as evidenced by the mind-blowing 12,262-metre deep Kola borehole in Russia - but the continental crust is a lot thicker than the oceanic crust.\n\nWe're not likely to reach the mantle from the bottom of the ocean anytime soon, either, but the oceanic crust is currently the best place to obtain samples that allow us to study it. At certain places, tectonic activity churns mantle material into the crust, from whence we can take it.\n\nBut drilling a deep hole at the bottom of the ocean at a tectonic boundary heated by volcanism, as you might imagine, is far easier said than done. Previous efforts have yielded a hole no deeper than 200.8 meters - and of the material drilled, only 47 percent was recovered.\n\nThe work of Lissenberg and his colleagues, therefore, is something really special. They drilled deep into a feature under the Atlantic Ocean known as the Atlantis Massif, a huge mountain mass standing some 4,267 meters from the seafloor at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a boundary between two tectonic plates. The massif, made up of mantle rock known as peridotite, is thought to have formed from mantle rock squeezing upwards through the crust.\n\n\"The original plan was to drill a shallow hole around 200 meters,\" geologist Kuan-Yu Lin of the University of Delaware said last year, after the drilling had been completed.\n\n\"But to our surprise, the hole just kept going deeper and deeper with extremely high recovery rates that were never seen before when drilling these types of rocks. Stunned by what we were seeing, the science party agreed to change the plan to keep deepening the hole.\"\n\nTheir hole, named Hole U1601C, extended a record 1,268 meters, and what the researchers extracted was even better. They managed to recover a whopping 71 percent of the core sample.\n\nThis sample, like the massif itself, consists of peridotite, a coarse-grained igneous rock made up almost entirely of olivine and pyroxene.\n\nWhen seawater is introduced, its meeting with the minerals provokes a reaction known as serpentinization, transforming the exposed olivine and pyroxene into serpentine minerals, producing hydrocarbons that can be used by seafloor lifeforms. But the result for geologists is that it becomes harder to interpret the rock, like trying to read ink that has been left in the rain.\n\nInterestingly, the researchers found that their core sample had become highly serpentinized, with even the least-altered peridotite being at 40 percent transformed, for the entire length of the sample, suggesting that seawater penetration is pretty high. In spite of this, though, the primary rock composition was preserved better than shallower cores, revealing new information about the mantle beneath the Atlantis Massif.\n\nThe researchers discovered a much lower pyroxene content than they expected, which could be due to the pyroxene dissolving when the rock was heated. And the researchers found that the movement of rock melt away from solid rock as the magma squeezed upward occurred at an oblique angle from the mantle upwelling - a finding that is very different from melt migration models.\n\nFinally, the researchers found intrusions of an igneous mineral called gabbro. The peridotite near these gabbroic intrusions show intense changes related to exposure to the hydrothermal environment not seen in other parts of the core sample, suggesting that gabbro plays an unexpected role in the fluid geochemistry of life-giving hydrothermal vents at the fascinating Lost City Hydrothermal Field.\n\nStudies to better understand the processes that shaped the rock will be ongoing, but the research so far demonstrates just how valuable drilling holes can be.\n\n\"The comprehensive rock record obtained during Expedition 399 provides a wealth of opportunities to make fundamental advances on our understanding of the oceanic upper mantle,\" the researchers write.\n\n\"The penetration of Hole U1601C into the subsurface of the Lost City hydrothermal field provides an opportunity to study the limits and extent of life in the oceanic lithosphere and a potential platform for future experiments on the geology, chemistry, and biology of an off-axis hydrothermal system.\"", "source": {"uri": "sciencealert.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScienceAlert"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michelle_starr@sciencealert.com", "name": "Michelle Starr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_crust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth's crust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peridotite", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peridotite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpentinite", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serpentinite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mantle (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crust (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rock (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_crust", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oceanic crust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igneous_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Igneous rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_sample", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Core sample"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Geologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seawater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_mantle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth's mantle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroxene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pyroxene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Peninsula", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kola Peninsula"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lithology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petrology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volcanic rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineralogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mineralogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borehole", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borehole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massif", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massif"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Geology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Geology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Geochemistry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Geochemistry", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Products_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Products and Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/pretty-rock.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802350", "eventUri": "eng-9802350", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

These processes are believed to have played a crucial role in the advent of life on Earth billions of years ago.\n\nThe mantle, which makes up more than 80% of Earth's volume, is a layer of silicate rock situated between the outer crust and the hot core. Typically, mantle rocks are inaccessible, except at seafloor spreading locations where tectonic plates diverge. The Atlantis Massif, located near the mid-Atlantic Ridge, is one such site where mantle rock is exposed on the seafloor.\n\nFrom April to June 2023, researchers drilled into the mantle rock about 2,800 feet (850 meters) beneath the ocean surface. They recovered a core sample that is 2,907 feet (886 meters) long, comprising more than 70% of the drilled rock. This achievement surpasses previous attempts, which penetrated no deeper than 656 feet (200 meters) with low rock recovery.\n\n\"The recovery is record-breaking,\" said Johan Lissenberg, a geologist at Cardiff University and lead author of the study published in Science. \"Previously, we have been largely limited to mantle samples dredged from the seafloor.\"\n\nThe core sample, with a diameter of about 2.5 inches (6.5 cm), revealed how the mineral olivine had reacted with seawater at various temperatures. This reaction releases hydrogen, forming compounds like methane that support microbial life, a key hypothesis for the origin of life on Earth.\n\n\"Our recovery of mantle rocks enables us to study these reactions in great detail and across a range of temperatures,\" Lissenberg said. The drill site, located near the Lost City Hydrothermal Field, an area with hydrothermal vents spewing super-heated water, is thought to be representative of the mantle rock beneath these vents.\n\n\"One suggestion for the origin of life on Earth is that it could have happened in an environment similar to Lost City,\" said Andrew McCaig, a geologist and study co-author from the University of Leeds.\n\nPreliminary analysis of the core sample has revealed a more extensive history of melting than expected, with the mineral orthopyroxene showing a wide range of abundance. This discovery relates to the flow of melt through the upper mantle, which rises beneath spreading plates and migrates towards the surface to feed volcanoes.\n\nThe core sample continues to be analyzed, promising further revelations about Earth's deep interior and its role in the planet's geological and biological history.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_mantle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth's mantle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mantle (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_sample", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Core sample"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rock (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seawater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis_Massif", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlantis Massif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabed", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seabed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JOIDES_Resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JOIDES Resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olivine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seamount", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seamount"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mineral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_mantle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Upper mantle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafloor_spreading", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seafloor spreading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silicate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crust (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_Ridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mid-Atlantic Ridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plate tectonics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Leeds", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Leeds"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Geology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Geology", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Education", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Education", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Geology,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Geology, Alternative", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Academic Departments", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202408/joides-resolution-091329939-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=8EV0d8g9X6WRpEPn061nrh32.ljpVPzZ", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802350", "eventUri": "eng-9802350", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 460895523, "relevance": 2}

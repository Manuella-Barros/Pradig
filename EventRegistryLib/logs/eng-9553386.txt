Keane - BBC Scotland's environment correspondent and Julie Anne Barnes - BBC Scotland News\n\nOne of the most common types of mosquito has been identified for the first time in locations across Scotland, according to researchers at the University of Glasgow.\n\nThey found 16 types of mosquito in Scotland, including the Culex pipiens, which is prevalent in North and South America, parts of Europe and some areas of Asia and Northern Africa.\n\nProf Heather Ferguson, who has been leading the study, said they were surprised to find the insects in all corners of the country.\n\nShe warned that warmer temperatures could lead to larger numbers of mosquitoes, including ones from areas where they can transmit diseases.\n\nWhile Scots have long been pestered by swarms of midgies, which thrive in the warm and wet conditions of a Scottish summer, there has been little knowledge about how widespread mosquitoes are north of the border.\n\nMosquitoes are larger than midgies and have a proboscis with which they suck blood.\n\nThis means mosquitoes are feared across the world as carriers of deadly diseases such as dengue and Zika.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 219 million people contract malaria from mosquitoes each year globally, resulting in 400,000 deaths.\n\nExperts stressed that the type of mosquito which carries malaria is unlikely to be found in the UK any time soon, though an early warning system is important.\n\nUntil now, very little has been known about how widespread mosquitoes are in Scotland.\n\nSo experts at the Centre for Virus Research have been keeping a close eye on their movements to monitor the impact of climate change on disease spread.\n\nThey hung traps at 24 locations across the country and lured the insects by the smell of carbon dioxide, which mimics human breath.\n\nThey found 16 varieties out of about 4,000 in the world.\n\nThe highest concentrations were at their sites around Loch Kinnordy in Angus and Broubster Leans in Caithness.\n\nProf Ferguson said: \"With warming temperatures we're going to see larger numbers of mosquitoes, potentially different species including some that might be migrating from other areas where they can transmit diseases,\" she said.\n\n\"They may be active for longer periods which means they maybe do pose a risk.\"\n\nDr Nick Phin, the medical director at Public Health Scotland, said mosquitoes could carry potentially deadly diseases so it was important to understand how they were spreading.\n\nHe said that in recent years the West Nile virus, which is mainly transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes, had been spreading across Europe.\n\n\"Cases have been identified in France,\" Dr Phin said.\n\n\"It doesn't take a leap of the imagination to see that very soon they could be detected in England and in Scotland\"\n\n\"It's the warmer winters rather than the summers which allow the mosquitoes to survive.\n\n\"That's because colder conditions kill of many of the insects, keeping populations numbers lower.\"\n\n'Surveillance system'\n\nA major worry is the UK becoming more suitable for invasive species such as the Asian tiger mosquito, also known as Aedes albopictus, which carries dengue fever.\n\nA recent UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) report looked at a worst case scenario.\n\nThey found England would be the first country in the UK to be affected, with Wales, Northern Ireland and parts of the Scottish Lowlands also becoming suitable habitats later in the century.\n\nThe mosquitoes have already been responsible for recent cases of dengue in France and the chikungunya virus in Italy.\n\nUKHSA already has a surveillance system in place to rapidly spot invasive mosquitoes, including a network of traps placed at UK borders that detect mosquito eggs.\n\nThe Scottish government says it also funds research through the Animal and Plant Health Agency.\n\nDr Phin says there now needs to be more government-backed studies to better understand the risks.\n\nHe said: \"Without a baseline to know what is currently happening it's difficult to say whether things are getting better or worse.\n\n\"If we do have a formal system, the hope is we'll identify some of these species early and take measure to hopefully stop them breeding in the UK.\n\n\"We need some formal structure around this surveillance.\n\n\"We need this to be continued in a very systematic and structured way to understand what's happening but to detect early incursions of these mosquitoes into Scotland.\"\n\nRelated

Look inside and instead of water and snacks, you'll see swarms of mosquitoes.\n\nMolecular biologist Deogratius Kavishe designed the bag to transport these bloodsucking insects from deep in the Tanzanian wilderness to the lab. Made from locally available materials like PVC fiberglass netting (often used for window screens), a metal frame and Tanzanian kitenge cotton fabric, the backpack cost about $70 to produce and can hold enough mosquitoes to fill 18 paper cups. Because the backpack is ventilated and has a cover flap that can be soaked in water, the environment inside remains cool and moist, protecting mosquito passengers from the sun and heat.\n\nKavishe, a research scientist at Ifakara Health Institute in central Tanzania, and colleagues intend to test whether mosquitoes in the region are still susceptible to a common class of insecticide. Insect nets laced with pyrethroids have been used for decades to kill mosquitoes that harbor diseases like malaria. The extended exposure has led many mosquito populations to become resistant, no longer reliably killed by the chemicals (SN: 5/21/23). \"We have a very big problem with resistance,\" says Kavishe.\n\nResistant mosquitoes have been found across Africa, with some populations able to survive exposure to pyrethroid levels that are 1,000 times higher than the standard deadly dose. The World Health Organization warns that this growing problem could erase the progress made in the last decade against malaria, which kills about 600,000 people worldwide each year. There's an idea that using pyrethroid in combination with another pesticide could help reverse the trend. For that strategy to work, though, there need to be some pyrethroid-susceptible mosquitoes still in the environment.\n\nSearching for those mosquitoes can entail long trips on foot through grasslands, forests and swamps. Once the insects are caught, they need to survive the journey to the lab to have their sensitivity tested. That's where the backpack-turned-mosquito-hotel comes in.\n\nKavishe's team brought mosquitoes from Ifakara to a nearby wildlife management area. From there, the researchers loaded up two backpacks with some of the insects and trekked into the wilderness. The rest of the mosquitoes stayed at the base camp to serve as controls.\n\nPutting the backpacks to the test also tested the scientists. Once, Kavishe walked 25 kilometers (about 15.5 miles) in a day. He also waded through floodwaters and mud up to his thighs, and encountered wild animals like snakes and buffalo. \"I wanted to quit several times,\" Kavishe recalls with a laugh.\n\nMosquitoes survived in the backpacks just as well as their less adventurous counterparts at base camp, the team reports in a study posted April 16 at bioRxiv.org. Their survival far exceeded the researchers' original goal of keeping mosquitoes alive for three days in the field -- after 10 days, about 70 percent were still alive. Of the mosquitoes that traveled the farthest, 143 kilometers over 25 days, around 30 percent survived. And more than half of wild-caught mosquitoes carried out of Nyerere National Park, some as far as 200 kilometers, survived the journey -- although this time, they weren't hauled all the way out on foot; the researchers could access areas in Nyerere by car or boat.\n\nNow that he knows the backpack works, Kavishe hopes to soon begin looking for pyrethroid-susceptible mosquitoes in earnest. \"Malaria is a big burden in our countries,\" he says. \"Whatever effort, whatever initiative, whatever success, which will maybe be able to eliminate malaria in four or five years -- if I'll be part of that, I'll feel very good.\"", "source": {"uri": "sciencenews.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Science News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Backpack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tanzania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Tanzania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrethroid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pyrethroid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Insect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Molecular biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiberglass", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiberglass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematophagy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hematophagy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_behaviour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swarm behaviour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilderness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wilderness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hiking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvinyl_chloride", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polyvinyl chloride"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scientist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cotton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifakara", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ifakara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ifakara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Tanzania"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swamp", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swamp"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pesticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grassland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insecticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountaineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mountaineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Animals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Pests_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Pests and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Pest_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Pest Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/042924_di_mosquito-backpack_feat.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553386", "eventUri": "eng-9553386", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-16", "textStart": 2858, "textEnd": 2866}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

A preview for the summer", "body": "A Volaris flight from Guadalajara to Mexico City was delayed more than two hours due to a mosquito infestation on board.\n\nMost residents are happy to see temperatures rise after a long winter, but for those who find themselves a frequent target of mosquitoes, the warm weather often comes at an itchy, uncomfortable cost.\n\nFortunately, North Jersey appears poised to see fewer mosquitoes than normal due to the lack of recent rainfall, according to experts.\n\nThe insect's population is \"strictly precipitation-driven,\" said Kris McMorland, director of the Morris County Department of Mosquito Control. Because they breed in standing water, a rainy season generally results in a higher concentration.\n\nA National Weather Service map showing precipitation totals over a 30-day period ending Sunday indicates all of New Jersey saw less rainfall than normal. North Jersey ranged from 1.5 inches below the average in Sussex and Morris counties to 2.5 inches below in Essex and Hudson counties.\n\nThe amount of foliage has also helped reduce the amount of mosquitoes in the spring, McMorland explained. The plants have absorbed much of the rain that has fallen, leaving mosquitoes with fewer wet areas to mate and lay their eggs.\n\nNorth Jersey had experienced precipitation amounts well above normal through the start of 2024, but much of that came before the start of mosquito season. The season generally runs from April to October when temperatures are consistently above 50 degrees, according to New Jersey-based Arrow Pest Control.\n\nDespite the promising outlook regarding mosquitoes, rain amounts can be inconsistent and difficult to predict. Last year, the region also saw a relatively dry spring before a period of heavy rain in June and July resulted in a 30-day total more than 9 inches above normal in some areas.\n\nMcMorland noted that he can't tell for sure how the rainfall amounts may change in the summer. For now, though, the area is \"in good shape\" in terms of controlling mosquitoes, he said.\n\nApart from being a general nuisance, mosquitoes can also carry diseases such as Zika virus and Eastern equine encephalitis that in some cases prove fatal. The insects can breed in as little as half a cup of water, and it takes just over a week for eggs to develop into adults, according to Arrow Pest Control.\n\nIn case the mosquito population becomes more prevalent than it has been so far, experts from Rutgers University and the Middlesex County Mosquito Extermination Commission have compiled a list of steps the public can follow to control the

Whether you're in a Malaria danger zone or just want to have a backyard barbecue in peace, fighting flying insects can take a substantial effort. It's also not always pleasant or possible to keep re-applying bug spray.\n\nWhile remarkably few high-tech products actually work to repel mosquitoes, one company is leading the way in mosquito-discouraging electronic devices. Thermacell's devices use either batteries or butane canisters and can create zones of up to 20 feet in diameter that are relatively free of the obnoxious, bloodsucking pest.\n\nVarious electronic devices have hit the market over the years with claims of non-invasive and, in many cases, chemical-free mosquito management. However, the reality is that many of them don't work. Two of the most talked-about yet least useful types are ultrasonic devices and UV lights, also sometimes called bug zappers.\n\nUltrasonic devices produce a sound that humans can't hear, and unscrupulous marketing teams claim this high-pitch frequency deters flying insects. But numerous controlled, scientific studies have shown time and time again that it's false. Ultrasonic devices don't deter or incapacitate mosquitoes.\n\nYou might also have heard of bug zappers. These are typically UV lights attached to electrified coils that spell doom for any flying pests that make contact. Unlike many other bugs, mosquitoes aren't attracted to UV light on its own. In other words, a typical bug zapper won't reduce the mosquito population.\n\nThere are cartridges containing a chemical called octenol that attracts mosquitoes. In theory, one of these cartridges could make a bug zapper work on mosquitoes, at least a little. In practice, though, they're not very effective at all.\n\nWhat's more, bug zappers kill insects indiscriminately, even though many of the bugs they attract benefit soil and plant health. Also, they zap bugs with so much force that insect bodies and their contents often explode, possibly contaminating surfaces around them.\n\nEntomologists (bug scientists) and environmental researchers universally pan bug zappers as being ineffective and bad for the environment. You shouldn't use them.\n\nThere aren't a lot of options, and many don't actually repel anything. The only significantly effective class of high-tech anti-mosquito equipment is basically a powered fogger. Thermacell makes a decently long line of battery-powered devices, as well as some that run on butane canisters that disperse a chemical called allethrin.\n\nAllethrin is part of a class of chemical compounds known as pyrethrins. Unlike DEET, which effectively masks the scent of carbon dioxide that mosquitos love, pyrethrins incapacitate or kill the insect. Allethrin does just that.\n\nAt the moment, Thermacell has cornered the market of allethrin-dispersing mosquito-fighting devices. The fumes are invisible, have no smell, and are safe for kids and pets. Allethrin also incapacitates a couple of species of fly.\n\nThere is one extremely high-tech method researchers use to fight populations of specific types of disease-carrying mosquitoes. Researchers are currently developing genetically modified mosquitoes and introducing them into problem areas to ultimately breed sterile mosquitoes.\n\nIn theory, this could eventually get the most dangerous strains under control. But the technology isn't perfect yet, and research is still underway. Plus, scientists will not likely use this genetic engineering technique to eliminate every mosquito, but only those known for carrying highly contagious diseases such as the Zika and West Nile viruses.\n\nInstead, consider these devices from Thermacell. They work by releasing allethrin into the air. For that reason, they won't work if it's windy, but mosquitoes don't bite as much in high winds.\n\nThermacell EX90\n\nAble to clear a 10-foot radius of flying, biting insects, this is Thermacell's most effective model. It's not portable enough to go hiking, but it does have a relatively long battery life.\n\nThermacell MR450\n\nInstead of full-on battery power, it runs on a watch battery and a special butane canister. It's one of the most portable options and is specifically meant for hiking in the woods.\n\nThermacell MR9W\n\nA soft white lamp inside means this one kills two birds with one stone, protecting those nearby from mosquitoes will also illuminate your outdoor gathering.\n\nThermacell MRBPR\n\nThis one's made for hiking, but not just any kind of hiking. It's engineered to run on the same isobutane canisters used by many backcountry stoves. If you're heading into the backcountry and want an interesting, reasonably effective weapon against flying insects, this is it.\n\nThermacell Perimeter System\n\nIf you have a large backyard and don't want to line it with boxy, plastic Thermacell devices, consider this discreet allethrin-dispensing system. Each purchase gets you a pair of in-ground spikes, and you can use as many as you need to cover your outdoor space.\n\nThermacell MRCLE\n\nThis option combines a common LED camp lantern with the company's effective insecticide delivery system, and it's not very expensive, either.\n\nMaxx Air Industrial Fan\n\nIt measures 30 inches, has three speeds and is as durable as they get. If Thermacell's allethrin systems don't work for you, consider this secret weapon in the war against mosquitoes: the fan. Mosquitoes can't fly very well, and a moderate breeze is enough to keep some breeds at bay. Either of these fans should work well for reasonably sized patios.\n\nSimple Deluxe 30-inch Drum Fan\n\nIt's as rugged as you'd expect from an industrial-style drum fan, but has special technology to keep the amount of noise much lower than similar industrial fans.\n\nIf you live in a warm, wet climate and routinely fight off massive hordes of mosquitoes, there's one relatively low-tech but surprisingly effective method that can help. It involves a medium-to-large, industrial-style fan and a bag of charcoal. It's especially effective in the Southeast United States.\n\nMosquitoes are attracted to heat and carbon dioxide, which is also what burning charcoal produces. Lighting a pile of charcoal simulates a human's body heat and CO2 exhalation. Cover the intake side of your outdoor fan in fine mesh and place the coals to the side of it.\n\nStart the process just before the time of day or night the mosquitoes in your area start to act up. Then it's time to play the waiting game. First, the mosquitoes come because they think the burning charcoal is a living person full of nutritious blood. When they reach the air current caused by the fan, the notoriously weak flyers get sucked into the mesh.\n\nAfter a few hours of this, you'll notice anywhere from a fine layer to a thick mass of mosquitoes stuck up against the netting. At this point, it's essential to wrap up and chemically treat the mosquito-covered netting before turning the fan off. After all, most of those mosquitoes are still alive and would love nothing more than to fly away.\n\nDon't let them. Spray them down with some insecticide, bury them in the trash, and get ready to do it again the next day. One time around might not make a massive difference in your mosquito problem, but after several days, you'll notice fewer and fewer mosquitoes caught in your net. That means it's working. Mosquitoes never fly very far from where they're bred, so this novel and somewhat low-tech method is a great way to rid a large backyard of thousands of mosquitoes.\n\nPrices listed reflect time and date of publication and are subject to change.\n\nCheck out our Daily Deals for the best products at the best prices and sign up here to receive the BestReviews weekly newsletter full of shopping inspo and sales.", "source": {"uri": "capitalgazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Capital Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allethrins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Allethrins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemiptera", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hemiptera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_zapper", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bug zapper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butane", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultraviolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Insect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hiking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest_(organism)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pest (organism)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ultrasound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrethrin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pyrethrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematophagy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hematophagy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetic engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbecue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barbecue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frequency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern United States"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Pest_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Pest Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Pest_Control", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Pest Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://www.capitalgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/high-tech-products-to-deal-with-mosquitoes.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553386", "eventUri": "eng-9553386", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

In 2023, one was found in Chiayi County's Jhongpu Township and one in Taichung's Xinwuri Station.\n\nHuang said that subsequent traces of the mosquitoes had not been found in those areas, which suggests they were isolated cases of mosquitoes traveling north, potentially in vehicles, and were unable to survive or breed.\n\nWhile isolated discoveries of the Aedes albopictus were made at 1,700m from 2009-2011, most mosquitoes were found at altitudes under 1,500m. However, recent discoveries suggest their distribution has expanded to include higher altitudes, Huang said.\n\nBecause fewer people now live in mountainous regions, the expansion is not expected to significantly increase the risk of dengue fever, Huang added.\n\nThe Ministry of Environment commissioned the research to investigate how climate change could impact the risk of disease.\n\nThe research suggests that with a 1.5-degree Celsius temperature increase, the northernmost point where mosquitoes are present could shift from Budai Township to Taichung's Taiping District in the west and Hualien County's Juisui Township in the east.\n\nWith a 2-degree Celsius temperature increase, the boundary where mosquitoes are present could shift to Taichung's Beitun District in the west and Hualien City in the east.\n\nIf temperatures rise by 2.5 degrees, the boundary could extend to Taichung's Tanzi District, according to the study.\n\nHuang noted that besides containers like vases and buckets, 34.4% of tires were found to be breeding sites for mosquitoes.\n\nHe reminded people to drill holes into waste tires if they intend to reuse them to prevent them from becoming breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\nHuang added that vector mosquito eggs can survive in dry environments for up to six months and hatch when it rains again.", "source": {"uri": "focustaiwan.tw", "dataType":

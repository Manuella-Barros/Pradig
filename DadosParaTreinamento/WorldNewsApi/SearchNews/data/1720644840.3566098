{"id": 231310740, "title": "Watch: Brian Scalabrine teams up with Red Panda at halftime", "text": "Brian Scalabrine has taken the floor at TD Garden countless times \u2013 as a player, a broadcaster, an emcee, and more. But Thursday night, he did so in a new role \u2013 as renowned entertainer Red Panda\u2019s sidekick. Scalabrine admitted beforehand that he was nervous. \u201cIf you [expletive] this up, you go down in infamy,\u201d Scalabrine said before Game 1. Scalabrine, who unsurprisingly towered over Red Panda, approached her and told her he\u2019s a \u201cmassive fan.\u201d Red Panda appreciated the kind words and explained to Scalabrine she would set the bowls next to the basket area. Scalabrine asked some follow-up questions about the order of operations, and Red Panda approved. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly right,\u201d she said with excitement. Scalabrine then asked what he should call Red Panda, to which she replied: \u201cRed Panda.\u201d He told her she could call him \u201cWhite Mamba.\u201d At halftime, Red Panda took center stage on her unicycle and went to work, casually flipping bowls from her feet to her head in typical electric fashion. Scalabrine then strolled to mid-court and gave her two more bowls, at which point Lucky told him he was a natural. As the degree of difficulty increased, and Red Panda added more bowls to the equation, Scalabrine reminded her: \u201cYou\u2019ve got this.\u201d Red Panda appreciated the reminder, but she didn\u2019t need it. She was in the zone.", "summary": "<p>\"If you [expletive] this up, you go down in infamy,\" Scalabrine told himself before Game 1.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-celtics/2024/06/08/celtics-mavericks-nba-finals-watch-brian-scalabrine-red-panda-video/\">Watch: Brian Scalabrine teams up with Red Panda at halftime</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.boston.com\">Boston.com</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-celtics/2024/06/08/celtics-mavericks-nba-finals-watch-brian-scalabrine-red-panda-video/", "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brian-Scalabrine-666463a356d02-768x432.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:35:07", "author": "Trevor Hass", "authors": ["Trevor Hass"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.165}

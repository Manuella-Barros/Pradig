Federal investigators have contacted Combs\u2019 accusers, interviewed them and notified them that they could be brought in to testify in front of a federal grand jury in New York City, sources told the outlet. However, witness preparations have not yet begun as the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agency is still in the process of gathering evidence in their federal investigation of Combs, sources added to CNN. One of the sources said that the HSI are making sure their investigation is thorough to ensure that any potential indictment brought forward against Combs is \u201cbulletproof.\u201d The HSI and Combs\u2019 representatives did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment. The HSI told CNN in a statement that the investigation is ongoing. At least six people have filed lawsuits claiming that Combs sexually assaulted or harassed them since November \u2014 with the latest lawsuit being filed on May 23. In some of the lawsuits sex trafficking allegations were also brought forward, along with allegations of the rapper drugging individuals against their will.

One source that was familiar with the investigation told CNN that it was \u201cmuch bigger than just these lawsuits,\u201d and that some accusers have been interviewed multiple times. Additionally, the sources claim new witnesses have also been brought in for questioning. Federal investigators previously raided the musician\u2019s properties in Los Angeles and Miami on March 25 as part of their probe into Combs. A source told CNN that agents are in possession of videos possibly obtained during the raid and are currently \u201ccontacting people that they\u2019ve found on the tapes.\u201d One person who has been questioned after featuring in one of the tapes is a male sex worker who lobbied allegations against the \u201cVictory\u201d rapper, a source told CNN. However, the source did not give any additional information on what may have been discussed. Combs has denied all allegations, saying in a statement obtained by PEOPLE in December: \u201cENOUGH IS ENOUGH. For the last couple of weeks, I have sat silently and watched people try to assassinate my character, destroy my reputation and my legacy.\u201d \"Sickening allegations have been made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday. Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged. I will fight for my name, my family and for the truth,\u201d he added. Following surveillance video released by CNN on May 17 showing Diddy grabbing, shoving and kicking his ex-girlfriend singer Cassie during a 2016 altercation \u2014 which had been detailed in a prior lawsuit she brought forward against him \u2014 the musician released an apology video. \u201cI was f---ed up. I mean I hit rock bottom but I make no excuses. My behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,\" he said on Instagram. He captioned the post, \"I'm truly sorry.\"", "summary": "Sources with knowledge on Combs&#39; probe said that those who filed a lawsuit against him have been interviewed by federal investigators", "url": "https://people.com/sean-diddy-combs-accusers-may-testify-in-front-of-federal-grand-jury-8655052", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/HNKrc7CAPn_MQ0iyCkb31v2QEmY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(760x360:762x362)/sean-diddy-combs-pre-grammy-gala-052924-1-1b160e265c374696881d1493f07b19a6.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:52:08", "author": "Kimberlee Speakman", "authors": ["Kimberlee Speakman"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.016}

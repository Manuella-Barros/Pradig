[+] via Getty Images) ICC via Getty Images Almost inevitably, given cricket's knack for igniting spot fires, the early stages of the historic T20 World Cup played in the U.S. have been dogged by controversies and criticisms. The much-hyped Nassau County Stadium in Eisenhower Park was unveiled to much fanfare, with much of the pre-tournament coverage centered on the lightning quick four-month construction of the 34,000-seat modular ground. But under such time pressures - the venue had only been locked in late last year after finding a suitable facility proved difficult - the stadium appeared very much hastily put together when its early matches were marred by ridiculously low scores. The drop-in pitch was labelled as 'dangerous' forcing authorities into damage control. There has also been some mockery of cricket's attempts into getting into the congested U.S. sports market and it's been well noted that the Nassau County Stadium in Long Island is 30 miles away from Manhattan.

The blockbuster between foes India and Pakistan in New York on June 9 has predictably been the hottest ticket of the tournament after being oversubscribed more than 200 times the allocation in the public ballot. Tickets at the time cost between $175-$400. Additional tickets were released during the week but general admission tickets, starting at $300, were gobbled up. Tickets on StubHub were reselling for over $600 - a figure that came down considerably after the eye-watering prices of more than $2000. Hospitality tickets were still available hours before the match at an astronomical price of $2500-$10,000. ForbesAdditional Tickets Released Ahead Of India-Pakistan T20 World Cup Cricket Frenzy In New YorkBy Tristan Lavalette But the sheer spectacle of India and Pakistan, as always, is hoped to save the day. The fanaticism over the contest, even in a cricket backwater, should create surreal scenes and showcase the most heated rivalry in all of sports that will be obsessively watched in South Asia. There are big financial stakes attached to the match. As I first reported, the 34,000-seat modular cricket stadium in Long Island cost around $30 million for T20 Incorporated, the entity established in the U.S. to deliver the event. ForbesNew York Cricket Stadium Set To Cost $30 Million As Anticipation Builds For T20 World CupBy Tristan Lavalette Officials have been confident the investment can be recouped through ticketing and hospitality - mostly through the India-Pakistan fixture which is expected to generate around $15 million at the gate. The demand has been jaw-dropping and gleaned through figures from Viagogo, a website that facilitates the resale of tickets to concerts, theatres and sporting events, and StubHub\u2019s international brand outside of North America. Based on Viagogo\u2019s worldwide data, 15% of all tickets sold for the T20 World Cup were for the India-Pakistan match, with an average ticket price of $1300, significantly higher than the $120 average for all other fixtures combined. The New York matches have accounted for 56% of all T20 World Cup ticket sales on Viagogo, with tickets purchased in 62 different countries for the U.S.-based matches. Viagogo's data is believed to be based on thousands of ticket sales. The U.S. - followed by Canada and India - is the country where fans have purchased the most tickets on the Viagogo marketplace across all matches.

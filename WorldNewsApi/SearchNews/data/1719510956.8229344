A big, green field is an optimal viewing spot. Another option is viewing from a pier. Asphalt or concrete can interfere with viewing because they radiate the sun\u2019s heat, so it\u2019s best to avoid those surfaces. On the edges of the solar disk, stargazers can also see solar prominences, which look like bright pieces of the sun whipping out and looping back into its surface. A prominence can loop hundreds of thousands of miles into space and last for several months. The glowing loops are made of plasma, a hot gas of electrically charged helium and hydrogen. There are also astronomical phenomena to check out during the evening. The scientific community is keeping a close watch on T Corona Borealis, a faint star that explodes into a very bright orb every 80 years. Astronomers predict this will happen \u201cany day now.\u201d \u201cT Corona Borealis is a star that you can never see,\u201d said Fried. \u201cEvery 80 years or so, it explodes and it rises to the level of a bright naked eye star that would be visible even in New York City.\u201d To join the countless astronomy buffs eagerly awaiting the explosion, find the nova in its constellation, Corona Borealis, which is located between the Hercules and Bo\u00f6tes star formations. The constellation looks like a crown or a big letter \"C.\" \u201cIt's going to explode pretty soon,\u201d Fried said, recommending that people find the star using a planetarium app on their phones.", "summary": "<img src=\"https://images-prod.gothamist.com/original_images/Image_from_iOS_3_s3ho6hr.jpg\" alt=\"A NASA image of a solar flare.\" />\n  \n    <p>A solar flare captured by NASA\u2019s Solar Dynamics Observatory on May 14.</p>\n  \n\n<p>Use telescopes or binoculars with solar lenses, according to the experts.

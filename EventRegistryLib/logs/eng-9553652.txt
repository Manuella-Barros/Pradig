The hatchback segment in India continues to be a high-volume segment, accounting for approximately 28 per cent of total passenger vehicle sales,'' Takeuchi said.\n\nInterestingly, the premium hatchback segment contributes nearly 60 per cent of total hatchback sales, he noted.\n\n''As a market leader, we took the responsibility to re-energise the hatchback segment at a time when this segment really needs a catalyst for growth,'' Takeuchi said.\n\nHe noted that the company has a strong belief in India's growth story.\n\n''As the government aims to make India a developed country by 2047, we can expect increased economic activity and robust demand for automobiles in the coming years'' Takeuchi stated.\n\nWith only 32 vehicles per 1,000 people compared to over 600 in developed countries like Japan, India presents a vast pool of car aspirants, he said.\n\n''As car ownership rises, the hatchback segment will serve as an entry point for many customers, and thus shall expand,'' Takeuchi noted.\n\nTherefore, the hatchback segment will continue to remain relevant for India, and the company's focus on this segment will persist, he added.\n\nThe auto major expects the premium hatchback segment to grow to 10 lakh units per annum by 2030 from 7 lakh units currently.\n\nThe small car segment, which had once dominated the Indian total passenger vehicles market, accounts for less than 30 per cent at present.\n\nTakeuchi said the company would like to maintain a high market share in the hatchback segment.\n\n''The situation is very good for us as everybody has stopped selling hatchbacks, so therefore the total market may have declined but our share is very high,'' he said Maruti Suzuki currently has a market share of around 69 per cent in the small car segment.\n\nTakeuchi noted that sooner or later with economic growth picking up, people will again start buying the hatchbacks and then the company's high market share will help it a lot.\n\n''So we will not give up on the segment. Our strategy is to have products in every segment in an adequate manner,'' he stated.\n\nWhen asked if the company would look at introducing a small electric car, Takeuchi stated that the company aims to introduce EVs at multiple price points.\n\nThe company's first EV model would come with an SUV body style, he stated.\n\nReplying to a query regarding Alto not being the best-selling car anymore, Takeuchi said: ''Generally in the market, the preference of the people towards the car will not be the same all the time, so it's changing.'' He further said: ''So I am sad...India's economy is growing and people will have different choices. In the past, there were not so many choices available and the buying power of people was also limited. But now people are growing, the economy is growing and more choices are available.'' Takeuchi noted that India continues to be an important market for Suzuki.\n\n''Our long-term goal is to produce and sell a total of four million units annually, including exports,'' he added.\n\nThe new Swift is priced between Rs 6.49 lakh and Rs 9.64 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).\n\nTakeuchi said the automaker has invested around Rs 1,450 crore towards the development of the premium hatchback.\n\nThis includes investment in tools and dyes for the vehicle as well as the new and more environment-friendly Z-Series engine, he added.\n\nThe model would be manufactured at Suzuki Motor Gujarat, from where it will serve customers in India as well as in overseas markets, Takeuchi said.\n\nThe new Swift, with a 1.2-litre petrol engine and six airbags as standard fitment, returns a fuel efficiency of up to 25.75 km per litre, marking a 14 per cent enhancement over the last generation model.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a

The company aims to capitalize on this trend by introducing new models to cater to diverse customer segments and enhance vehicular safety standards. Small-car sales fell 12% in FY24.Small cars sales in the local market will revive in the next couple of years on back of economic growth and improvement in income levels of customers at the entry-level, the country's largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki said, adding it expects to capitalise on the growth in the segment going ahead with most competitors exiting the space.\n\nMaruti Suzuki Managing Director Hisashi Takeuchi said one million premium hatchbacks alone are expected to sold in the country by FY31, up from 680,000 units last fiscal. \"We sell decent volumes, make money on these cars. We have very high market share in small cars. And as the economy grows, the the market will revive, we will grow because others have stopped sales in the space,\" he said on the sidelines of the launch of the new Swift priced between Rs 6.49-9.64 lakh (ex-showroom, India).\n\nSmall-car sales fell 12% in FY24 when the passenger vehicle industry grew 8.7%, led by robust demand for SUVs. The share of small cars in overall vehicle sales stood at 27.7%, down from 34.4% in FY23 and 47.4% in FY18. Maruti Suzuki leads in small cars with a share of 69%.\n\n\"Vehicle prices at the entry level went up much faster than income levels of buyers the last few years, which impacted demand,\" Takeuchi said. Increases in input costs, insurance charges, road taxes, and the transition to higher emission and safety norms, among others, led to a spike in prices in the price-sensitive, small-car and two-wheeler segments, hitting demand.\n\nSluggish sales prompted several automakers including Nissan, Honda and Volkswagen, to exit the small-car market in the country over the last few years. The total number of models on offer in the segment now stands at 14, compared with a record 31 in FY16.\n\nTakeuchi admitted the reduction in the number of models on offer in the market has also impacted demand in the segment. But, he said, with the government looking at making India a developed country by 2047, we can expect increased economic activity and robust demand for automobiles in the coming years.\n\n\"With only 32 vehicles per 1,000 people compared to over 600 in developed countries like Japan, India presents a vast pool of car aspirants. As car ownership rises, the hatchback segment will serve as an entry point for many customers, and thus shall expand\", Takeuchi informed.\n\nThe hatchback segment will continue to remain relevant for India, and the company's focus on this segment will persist, he emphasised. Maruti Suzuki has invested Rs 1,450 crore to develop the new Swift. This includes investment in tools and dies for the vehicle as well as the new and more environment friendly Z-Series engine. The Swift comes with 6 airbags in all variants. Maruti Suzuki said starting with SUV Jimny, it has started introducing 6 airbags as a standard feature in all new models to enhance vehicular safety.\n\nThe new Swift will be manufactured at Suzuki Motor Gujarat plant, from where the company will serve customers in India as well as in overseas markets.\n\n\"For us to maintain our leadership position, it is important to cater to diverse customer segments. The hatchback segment in India continues to be a high-volume segment, accounting for approximately 28% of total passenger vehicle sales.

Since then, 6.5 million units of Swift has been sold in 169 countries with India contributing to 46% or 3 million sales followed by 1.2 million in Europe and 70,000 in Japan.\n\nTakeuchi also pointed to the shift within the hatchback segment with premium hatchbacks grabbing a dominant share of the pie. \"At present, 60% of hatchbacks sold in the country are premium ones. Maruti's market share in the premium hatchback segment is 62%,\" he said.\n\nWhile Maruti has multiple offerings in the premium hatch segment including Baleno, Fronx (that is is another iteration of Baleno), Swift and Ignis, only Hyundai Motor with i20, Tata Motors with Altroz and Toyota Kirloskar with Glanza and Taizor are present in this segment. Of these, the Toyota cars are rebadged Maruti Suzuki products.\n\nTakeuchi said the company had invested Rs 1,450 crore in the 4th generation Swift, including engine and sheet metal dice at Suzuki Motors Gujarat plant where it will be manufactured for both India and overseas markets.\n\n\"The first million Swift cars were sold in eight years. It took five years to sell the second million. The car has not only stood the test of time but shaped a better legacy,\" said Partho Banerjee, senior executive officer (marketing and sales) at Maruti Suzuki.\n\nThe Swift had killed the Hyundai Getz, a premium hatch launched by the Korean company just before Maruti Suzuki launched the Swift inspired by the legendary Hayabusa motorcycle.

But we have to have multiple price points for our EVs,\" Takeuchi told reporters.\n\nMaruti Suzuki plans to roll out its maiden battery electric vehicle eVX by the end of the ongoing fiscal.\n\nIndia's largest carmaker is not giving up on entry-level small cars even as sales of hatchbacks witnessed a decline over the past several quarters as India's car market moved towards SUVs.\n\nThe total market of entry-level cars may be declining but Maruti Suzuki's share is high, says Takeuchi. \"This situation is very good for us where everybody is escaping. Sooner or later, once economy grows, people will start buying hatchbacks. Then our high market share will help us a lot. We will not give up the hatchback market. We will offer more models at an appropriate time,\" he says.\n\nThe CEO of Maruti Suzuki believes that the hatchback segment will not disappear. \"Lack of models in the entry-level segment from other OEMs is limiting growth in the small car category. We will not give up on small cars. When time comes we will revamp other products also. Hatchbacks will continue and hopefully when the economy grows, it will revive,\" says Takeuchi.\n\nThe small car segment, which contracted during the last fiscal and in April 2024, still drives a significant number of sales for the Japanese carmaker. Maruti Suzuki expects small car sales to revive after two years as affordability is still an issue for entry-level car buyers.\n\nOut of 1,000 people, only 32 own a car in India. The Japanese carmaker expects car penetration in India to increase to 44 cars per 1,000 people by 2030. This is expected to be aided by first-time car buyers and those looking to upgrade from two-wheelers.\n\nTo meet the ever-growing demand for SUVs, Maruti Suzuki is ramping up its capacity for larger utility vehicles.\n\n\"Maruti in the last 2-3 years had a limitation of capacity in manufacturing bigger cars when the market shifted towards bigger cars from smaller cars following a relatively sharper increase in prices of smaller cars. We did not anticipate that there would be such a big increase in costs happening there and that it would have an impact. So our production capacity got out of tune with the market requirements. It took us time but we have adjusted to a large extent. We are sharply increasing our market in bigger cars,\" Maruti Suzuki chairman RC Bhargava said last month.\n\nThe automaker has now enabled production lines at its factories to produce multiple products. \"We are now getting more flexible to the demand,\" says Takeuchi.", "source": {"uri": "fortuneindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FortuneIndia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maruti_Suzuki", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maruti Suzuki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatchback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hatchback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Compact car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Original equipment manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motorcycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Car_Rentals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Car Rentals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/fortuneindia/2024-05/9009a319-0776-4064-8b6a-87ffd8924efe/Maruti_CEO.JPG?w=700", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553652", "eventUri": "eng-9553652", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Demand for small cars is likely to come back over the coming years even though the segment has seen its share in total car sales contract by nearly half over the past four years, said Hisashi Takeuchi, MD & CEO of Maruti Suzuki.\n\nThe country's largest carmaker has built its foundations on mini cars, such as, Maruti800, Alto, Zen, WagonR, Swift, and Baleno, since it began operations in 1983.However, after the boom in demand for SUVs, which now account for 50% share in passenger vehicle segment, share of small cars has declined to 28% at FY24-end against over 50% a few years back.\n\nIn FY24, 12 lakh small cars were sold in the country (against total sales of around 40 lakh units), with Maruti accounting for 68% (on total volumes of 8.1 lakh units.)\n\nTakeuchi, after introducing new-gen version of Swift, said despite pressures, Maruti \"still makes money\" on sale of small cars. \"We continue to maintain a high market share in the category. Sooner or later, as the economy starts to pick up, demand for small cars will return.\"\n\nRavi Bhatia, India president of automobile research firm JATO Analytics, said small car category has seen rise in pressure due to increasing popularity of similarly-priced mini SUVs. \"The faux SUVs are new hatches,\" he said, adding, despite fall in small car sales, numbers of Swift grew 10% last year.\n\nFirst introduced in May 2005, Swift is one of Maruti's most-successful mini cars and has sold nearly 30 lakh units till now.

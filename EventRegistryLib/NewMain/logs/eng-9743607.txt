Ollie Pope recorded a brilliant century as the hosts displayed aggressive cricket to post a 416 total at the end of Day 1's play in Nottingham.\n\nAfter being forced to bat first, England lost their opener Zak Crawley to Alzarri Joseph in the very first over. But Ben Duckett and Pope gave the Three Lions a sensational start by adding 105 runs for the second wicket in the first 19 overs.\n\nDuckett smashed a 32-ball fifty as England reached the 50-run mark in just 4.2 overs, the fastest in Test cricket history. Pope was cautious compared to Duckett but kept the scoreboard moving with regular ones and twos. Shamar Joseph gave West Indies a breakthrough with Duckett's wicket in the 19th over who scored 71 runs off just 59 balls.\n\nPope kept England ahead with crucial partnerships with Joe Root and Harry Brook and scored his sixth Test hundred. Alzarri ended Pope's brilliant knock of 121 off 167 balls just before the Tea and that paved the way for the Caribbean bowlers to dominate the last session.\n\nBen Stokes scored a crucial fifty by smashing 69 runs off 104 balls while tailenders Jamie Smith and Chris Woakes contributed with 30-plus scores to take England past 400. West Indies bowlers bowled impressively with six wickets in the third session with Alzarri taking three wickets and finishing England's first innings to 416 in 88.3 overs.\n\nMeanwhile, Duckett smashed a 32-ball fifty, the joint-third fastest for England in Test cricket while Joe Root surpassed the legendary Sri Lankan Mahela Jayawardene's tally to reach 11,818 runs in Test cricket on Day 1

Day 1: Ton-up Pope leads England to 416 all out", "body": "Ollie Pope rode his luck to a hundred as England ended the first day of the second Test against the West Indies at Trent Bridge on Thursday in a commanding position at 416 all out.\n\nEngland vs West Indies, 2nd Test, West Indies tour of England\n\nOllie Pope rode his luck to a hundred as England ended the first day of the second Test against the West Indies at Trent Bridge on Thursday in a commanding position at 416 all out.\n\nBoth sides had reason to feel frustrated, with the West Indies dropping four catches -- Pope was reprieved twice -- and wicketkeeper Joshua Da Silva missing a stumping, while several England batsmen gave their wickets away.\n\nBen Duckett launched the innings with a rapid 71, after fellow opener Zak Crawley fell for a duck, with England racing to 50 in a mere 4.2 overs -- the quickest a side have reached that total in a Test match.\n\nIt was all very much in the spirit of 'Bazball', the nickname for England's aggressive style of Test cricket under captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum.\n\nYet for all his advocacy of such a bold approach, few England cricketers are better at playing a match situation than Stokes, who on Thursday made a measured 69 off 108 balls.\n\nBut with West Indies missing paceman Shamar Joseph who broke down in the last over before tea and the attack seemingly at his mercy, Stokes holed out off Kavem Hodge to give the part-time spinner a first Test wicket.\n\nJamie Smith, fresh from a dashing 70 on debut during England's crushing innings and 114-run win in the first Test at Lord's last week, also donated his wicket to Hodge.\n\nOff-spinner Kevin Sinclair returned sound figures of 2-73 in 22 overs despite only being called into a previously announced team on Thursday morning after Gudakesh Motie dropped out with illness.\n\nWest Indies delayed taking the new ball until England were 397-8 off 86 overs.\n\nOff the very next delivery Chris Woakes glanced Alzarri Joseph for a four that took England past 400.\n\nWest Indies did bowl England out when Alzarri Joseph (3-98 in 15.3 overs) had last man Shoaib Bashir caught in the slips to end play for the day.\n\nEarlier, Pope was dropped on 46 and 54, with Alick Athanaze at backward point and the usually reliable Jason Holder at second slip dropping catches.\n\nPope pressed on to a hundred, the 26-year-old completing his sixth century in 45 Tests when he hammered Jayden Seales for a 15th four in 143 balls faced.\n\nHis luck ran out when he was brilliantly caught by Hodge, high above his head at first slip, off Alzarri Joseph to end a partnership of 80 with Stokes.\n\nWest Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite won the toss and opted to bowl despite sunny conditions seemingly ideal for batting.\n\nYet his decision was understandable given the West Indies were dismissed for just 121 and 136 at Lord's.\n\nIt took West Indies just three balls to strike on Thursday, with Crawley edging an excellent delivery from Alzarri Joseph low to third slip, where a diving Athanaze held a fine catch.\n\nBut England soon regained the initiative as Duckett struck four successive fours in the second over of the match from Seales.\n\nThe left-hander produced a sparkling 59-ball innings on his Nottinghamshire home ground, with 56 runs of his runs coming in boundaries courtesy of 14 fours.\n\nDuckett was out shortly before lunch, edging a good-length ball from Shamar Joseph to second slip, where towering all-rounder Holder held a fine low catch.\n\nDuckett's exit ended a second-wicket partnership of 105 in 19 overs with Pope.\n\nEngland are seeking a win that would clinch the three-match series with one Test to spare.\n\nThis was their first match since James Anderson retired from international duty with 704 Test wickets -- the most by any fast bowler -- following the Lord's Test.\n\nIt was also England's first home Test since 2012 without either Anderson or longtime new-ball partner Stuart Broad, who bowed out after last year's Ashes.\n\nEngland - Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (c), Captain, Jamie Smith (wk),

Test against West Indies at Trent Bridge on Thursday in a commanding position at 416 all out.\n\nBoth sides had reason to feel frustrated, with West Indies dropping four catches - Pope was reprieved twice - and wicketkeeper Joshua Da Silva missing a stumping, while several England batters gave their wickets away.\n\nBen Duckett launched the innings with a rapid 71, after fellow opener Zak Crawley fell for a duck, with England racing to 50 in a mere 4.2 overs - the quickest a side has reached that total in a Test match.\n\nIt was all very much in the spirit of 'Bazball', the nickname for England's aggressive style of Test cricket under captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum.\n\nYet for all his advocacy of such a bold approach, few England cricketers are better at playing a match situation than Stokes, who on Thursday made a measured 69 off 108 balls.\n\nBut with West Indies missing paceman Shamar Joseph, who broke down in the last over before Tea, and the attack seemingly at his mercy, Stokes holed out off Kavem Hodge to give the part-time spinner a first Test wicket.\n\nJamie Smith, fresh from a dashing 70 on debut during England's crushing innings and 114-run win in the first Test at Lord's last week, also donated his wicket to Hodge.\n\nOff-spinner Kevin Sinclair returned sound figures of two for 73 in 22 overs despite only being called into a previously announced team on Thursday morning after Gudakesh Motie dropped out with illness.\n\nWest Indies delayed taking the new ball until England was 397 for eight off 86 overs.\n\nOff the very next delivery, Chris Woakes glanced Alzarri Joseph for a four that took England past 400.\n\nWest Indies did bowl England out when Alzarri Joseph (three for 98 in 15.3 overs) had last man Shoaib Bashir caught in the slips to end play for the day.\n\nEarlier, Pope was dropped on 46 and 54, with Alick Athanaze at backward point and the usually reliable Jason Holder at second slip dropping catches.\n\nPope pressed on to a hundred, the 26-year-old completing his sixth century in 45 Tests when he hammered Jayden Seales for a 15th four in 143 balls faced.\n\nHis luck ran out when he was brilliantly caught by Hodge, high above his head at first slip, off Alzarri Joseph to end a partnership of 80 with Stokes.\n\nQuick-fire England\n\nWest Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite won the toss and opted to bowl despite sunny conditions seemingly ideal for batting.\n\nYet his decision was understandable given West Indies was dismissed for just 121 and 136 at Lord's.\n\nIt took West Indies just three balls to strike on Thursday, with Crawley edging an excellent delivery from Alzarri Joseph low to third slip, where a diving Athanaze held a fine catch.\n\nBut England soon regained the initiative as Duckett struck four successive fours in the second over of the match from Seales.\n\nThe left-hander produced a sparkling 59-ball innings on his Nottinghamshire home ground, with 56 runs of his runs coming in boundaries courtesy of 14 fours.\n\nDuckett was out shortly before lunch, edging a good-length ball from Shamar Joseph to second slip, where towering all-rounder Holder held a fine low catch.\n\nDuckett's exit ended a second-wicket partnership of 105 in 19 overs with Pope.\n\nEngland is seeking a win that would clinch the three-match series with one Test to spare.\n\nThis was its first match since James Anderson retired from international duty with 704 Test wickets - the most by any fast bowler - following the Lord's Test.\n\nIt was also England's first home Test since 2012 without either Anderson or longtime new-ball partner Stuart Broad, who bowed out after last year's Ashes.\n\n(with inputs from AFP)\n\nLatest on SportstarENG vs WI, 2nd Test, Day 2 LIVE updates:

Thursday morning after Gudakesh Motie dropped out with illness.\n\nWest Indies delayed taking the new ball until England were 397-8 off 86 overs.\n\nOff the very next delivery Chris Woakes glanced Alzarri Joseph for a four that took England past 400.\n\nWest Indies did bowl England out when Alzarri Joseph (3-98 in 15.3 overs) had last man Shoaib Bashir caught in the slips to end play for the day.\n\nEarlier, Pope was dropped on 46 and 54, with Alick Athanaze at backward point and the usually reliable Jason Holder at second slip dropping catches.\n\nPope pressed on to a hundred, the 26-year-old completing his sixth century in 45 Tests when he hammered Jayden Seales for a 15th four in 143 balls faced.\n\nHis luck ran out when he was brilliantly caught by Hodge, high above his head at first slip, off Alzarri Joseph to end a partnership of 80 with Stokes.\n\nWest Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite won the toss and opted to bowl despite sunny conditions seemingly ideal for

But England soon regained the initiative as Duckett struck four successive fours in the second over of the match from Seales.\n\nThe left-hander produced a sparkling 59-ball innings on his Nottinghamshire home ground, with 56 runs of his runs coming in boundaries courtesy of 14 fours.\n\nDuckett was out shortly before lunch, edging a good-length ball from Shamar Joseph to second slip, where towering all-rounder Holder held a fine low catch.\n\nDuckett's exit ended a second-wicket partnership of 105 in 19 overs with Pope.\n\nEngland are seeking a win that would clinch the three-match series with one Test to spare.\n\nThis was their first match since James Anderson retired from international duty with 704 Test wickets - the most by any fast bowler - following the Lord's Test.\n\nIt was also England's first home Test since 2012 without either Anderson or longtime new-ball partner Stuart Broad, who bowed out after last year's Ashes.\n\nSCOREBOARDEngland 1st InningsZ.

England ended the first day of the second Test against the West Indies at Trent Bridge on Thursday in a commanding position at 416 all out.\n\nBoth sides had reason to feel frustrated, with the West Indies dropping four catches - Pope was reprieved twice - and wicketkeeper Joshua Da Silva missing a stumping, while several England batsmen gave their wickets away.\n\nBen Duckett launched the innings with a rapid 71, after fellow opener Zak Crawley fell for a duck, with England racing to 50 in a mere 4.2 overs - the quickest a side have reached that total in a Test match.\n\nIt was all very much in the spirit of 'Bazball', the nickname for England's aggressive style of Test cricket under captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum.\n\nYet for all his advocacy of such a bold approach, few England cricketers are better at playing a match situation than Stokes, who on Thursday made a measured 69 off 108 balls.\n\nBut with West Indies missing paceman Shamar Joseph who broke down in the last over before tea and the attack seemingly at his mercy, Stokes holed out off Kavem Hodge to give the part-time spinner a first Test wicket.\n\nJamie Smith, fresh from a dashing 70 on debut during England's crushing innings-and-114-run win in the first Test at Lord's last week, also donated his wicket to Hodge.\n\nOff-spinner Kevin Sinclair returned sound figures of 2-73 in 22 overs despite only being called into a previously announced team on Thursday morning after Gudakesh Motie dropped out with illness.\n\nThe West Indies delayed taking the new ball until England were 397-8 off 86 overs.\n\nOff the very next delivery Chris Woakes glanced Alzarri Joseph for a four that took England past 400.\n\nThe West Indies did bowl England out when Alzarri Joseph (3-98 in 15.3 overs) had last man Shoaib Bashir caught in the slips to end play for the day.\n\nEarlier, Pope was dropped on 46 and 54, with Alick Athanaze at backward point and the usually reliable Jason Holder at second slip dropping catches.\n\nPope pressed on to a hundred, the 26-year-old completing his sixth century in 45 Tests when he hammered Jayden Seales for a 15th four in 143 balls faced.\n\nHis luck ran out when he was brilliantly caught by Hodge, high above his head at first slip, off Alzarri Joseph to end a partnership of 80 with Stokes.\n\nWest Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite won the toss and

a fine low catch.\n\nDuckett's exit ended a second-wicket partnership of 105 in 19 overs with Pope.\n\nEngland are seeking a win that would clinch the three-match series with one Test to spare.\n\nThis was their first match since James Anderson retired from international duty with 704 Test wickets - the most by any fast bowler - following the Lord's Test.\n\nIt was also England's first home Test since 2012 without either Anderson or longtime new-ball partner Stuart Broad, who bowed out after last year's Ashes.", "source": {"uri": "sacricketmag.com", "dataType": "news",

He was threatening England's fastest century in Test cricket before he was dismissed for 71 from 59 balls.\n\nPope took advantage of being dropped on 46 and 54 to reach three figures from 143 balls, before captain Ben Stokes made a welcome 69.\n\nThe skipper was one of a number of England batters who found a way to get out, particularly to off-spinner Kevin Sinclair and left-armer Kavem Hodge.\n\nIn a chaotic end to the day, England lost their last five wickets for 74 runs, West Indies took their tally of drops to four and Mark Wood survived a stumping chance off Hodge.\n\nWood and Chris Woakes took England past 400, before the latter and Shoaib Bashir fell in successive overs, Bashir to the final ball of the day.\n\nEngland, 1-0 up and with the chance to win the series, are in a strong position, but one that could have been stronger.\n\nEngland take initiative on action-packed day\n\nThere was enough action and incident on a sun-soaked first day in Nottingham to fill an entire Test.\n\nIt marked the start of a new England era, this is their first home Test without James Anderson and Stuart Broad since 2012. Anderson is part of the England staff and Broad was honoured by the Pavilion End of his old home ground being renamed after him.\n\nTrent Bridge is where Bazball was born with the thrilling run chase against New Zealand in 2022. When the Windies won the toss, they gave England the chance to score quickly in beautiful conditions, albeit if Stokes said was undecided over what he would have chosen.\n\nThe tourists' decision looked a good one as Zak Crawley was out to the third ball of the match, but apart from Sinclair's somersault to celebrate his removal of Harry Brook - Sinclair is playing in place of the ill Gudakesh Motie - it was mainly downhill for West Indies from that point.\n\nThe visitors' pace bowling was wayward, their catching wasteful and ground-fielding sloppy, while Shamar Joseph again struggled with a left-leg injury. England had their share of poor moments, most glaringly the shots to get out by Joe Root and Brook, the latter who had also been dropped by Alick Athanaze.\n\nIn between was some glorious strokeplay, not England going at full throttle, instead skilfully taking advantage of West Indian generosity, small boundaries and a lightning outfield.\n\nIt was breathless stuff and terrific entertainment as England gained the platform for their new-look attack to examine the fragile West Indian batting on Friday.\n\nPope cashes in after drops\n\nPope's 57 in the first Test ended a run of eight England innings without a half-century, going back to his epic 196 that helped defeat India in Hyderabad in January. Arriving in the first over after Crawley edged Alzarri Joseph to a diving Athanaze at third slip, Pope punched the third ball he faced through mid-on for four.\n\nFor some time, Pope was in the shadow of Duckett, who was on course to beat Gilbert Jessop's 122-year-old record for the fastest England Test ton, made off 76 balls. Playing sweet cover-drives, Duckett reached 50 from 32 balls, only to be frustrated by his poke to second slip off Shamar Joseph.\n\nPope's moments of fortune came either side of lunch. Gully Athanaze could not hold a powerful cut off the bowling of Jayden Seales, then Jason Holder put down a straightforward chance at second slip off Shamar Joseph.\n\nReprieved, Pope favoured the leg side. His 83rd run was his first in front of square on the off side.\n\nThe England vice-captain pulled Seales for four to reach his second Test hundred on this ground and sixth overall, all made against different opponents. It was his fifth since being promoted to number three, the most by an England batter in that position since Jonathan Trott.\n\nWhen Pope gave a third chance, edging a drive at Alzarri Joseph, first-slip Hodge finally clung on.\n\nStokes joins in to end torrid run\n\nFor as much as this was a very good day for England, it could have been better. Only Crawley was undone by good bowling and even the trio that passed fifty will feel like they left runs out there.\n\nStill, these were welcome runs for Stokes. For all of the attention on the captain's return to bowling, he had registered five successive single-figure scores in Tests.\n\nWhereas Duckett started rapidly and slowed, Stokes began with patience before accelerating. The skipper had only six from his first 22 deliveries, then scored more quickly as West Indies tested him against the short ball. Stokes' next 44 runs came from 49 balls as he reached 50 from 71.\n\nStokes had a century at his mercy but picked out deep mid-wicket to give Hodge his first Test wicket and begin the frantic finish to the day. Jamie Smith's cameo of 36 ended when he hit Hodge to mid-off, then Gus Atkinson edged Sinclair to slip.\n\nWood had one when he missed Hodge, only for Joshua da Silva to fluff the stumping, and two when he slashed Sinclair to point, where Mikyle Louis dropped the catch.\n\nWoakes, in his 50th Test, played nicely for 37 before West Indies belatedly took the second new ball. Woakes edged Seales and Bashir edged Alzarri Joseph, Holder taking both catches at second slip.", "source": {"uri": "kaieteurnewsonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kaieteur News"}, "authors":

The home side finished on 416 in 88.3 overs, with Ollie Pope smashing a fine century. Skipper Ben Stokes led from the front with a half-century. Earlier, Ben Duckett gave a blazing start to England, who recorded the fastest-ever team fifty in Tests.\n\nWest Indies started well after electing to field as Alzarri Joseph dismissed Zak Crawley on the match's third ball. However, Duckett smashed Jayden Seales for four successive boundaries in the very next over. Duckett and Pope were on fire thereafter, powering England to 50 in just 4.2 overs. The duo added 105 runs for the second wicket.\n\nAs per ESPNcricinfo, England's 4.2-over fifty is now the fastest for a team in Test cricket. The Englishmen broke their own record as they hammered one in 4.3 overs against South Africa in the 1994 Oval Test. Notably, England also occupy the third spot with a fifty in 4.6 overs against Sri Lanka in 2002 in Manchester.\n\nEngland were cruising on 105/1 before Shamar Joseph gave WI their second breakthrough in the form of Duckett. The England opener eventually fell for a 59-ball 71 (14 fours). He struck at a staggering 120.34. In the 30th over (post lunch), Joe Root's 14-run knock was cut short by Seales. While Pope held one end, Harry Brook (36) departed shortly after England reached 200.\n\nDuckett also reached a couple of landmarks on Day 1 at Trent Bridge. With his 62nd run, the England opener completed 10,000 runs in First-Class cricket. He also completed 1,500 Test runs during the course of his knock. Notably, Duckett has smashed three tons and eight half-centuries in the format so far. As per ESPNcricinfo, Duckett has over 570 Test runs at home.\n\nDuckett completed his half-century off 32 balls, the joint third-fastest for England in Test cricket along with Ian Botham (vs New Zealand, The Oval, 1986). Notably, Botham leads this list with a 28-ball fifty against India in Delhi in 1981. Jonny Bairstow hammered a fifty off 30 balls against New Zealand in the 2022 Headingley Test.\n\nPope raced to his sixth Test century with a boundary off Seales in the second session. He took 143 balls to reach three figures. England had crossed the 220-run mark by the time Pope completed his ton. Alzarri Joseph dismissed Pope before England reached 300. The England batter scored a 167-ball 121 (15 fours and 1 six).\n\nDuring his knock, Pope attained another feat. With his 19th run, he completed 7,000 runs in First-Class cricket. Over 2,500 of his runs have come in England whites. Pope is playing his 104th game in First-Class cricket.\n\nEngland captain Stokes, who was knocked over by Gudakesh Motie at Lord's, played a captain's knock in the 1st innings in Nottingham. He launched a counter-attack in the final session, having scored 69 off 104 balls. His knock included 8 boundaries. All-rounder Kavem Hodge, who bowls left-arm spin, dismissed the England captain in the final session (72nd over).\n\nIt is worth noting that WI dropped four catches on Day 1. Pope was dropped twice, while Mark Wood and Harry Brook got a reprieve each. WI dropped at least one catch in each of the three sessions.\n\nAfter dismissing Stokes, spinner Hodge got rid of Jamie Smith, who scored a 54-ball 36. Kevin Sinclair followed it up by dismissing Gus Atkinson. Chris Woakes and Mark Wood took the hosts past 400 thereafter. WI took the second new ball, which helped their cause. Seales and Joseph dismissed Woakes and Shoaib Bashir, respectively, ending England's innings.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [],

"title": "England vs West Indies: Ollie Pope century puts hosts on top after day one of second Test in Nottingham", "body": "Highlights from the day one of the second Test between England and West Indies at Trent Bridge as Ollie Pope's century underpinned the home side's 416 all out\n\nOllie Pope led the way with 121 as England moved into a dominant position on day one of the second Test against the West Indies at Trent Bridge.\n\nA quick-fire 105 stand between Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope helped England recover from the first-over loss of Zak Crawley and the home side reached the lunch break on 134-2 as the West Indies struggled to make the most of choosing to bowl first.\n\nJoe Root and Harry Brook both fell in the afternoon session too, but the tourists were made to pay for twice dropping Pope as he went on to reach a sixth Test century and his first since a sparkling 196 which helped set up victory in the first Test against India in Hyderabad back in January.\n\nEngland's vice-captain, who made 145 on the same ground against New Zealand two years ago as well, was eventually removed five overs after tea, with skipper Ben Stokes' first half-century of the summer helping his side on their way to reaching a first-innings total of 416 before being all out just before the scheduled close.\n\nWest Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite could hardly have wished for a better start after winning the toss as Alzarri Joseph struck third ball, tempting England opener Crawley into edging the third ball of the day to slip fielder Alick Athanaze after a fiery opening two deliveries.\n\nBut Nottinghamshire batter Duckett spearheaded a recovery from that early loss on his home ground, taking a particular liking to the bowling of Jayden Seales with a flurry of boundaries as the seamer's opening two overs went for 28 runs.\n\nTogether, he and Pope helped England race to 50 in just 26 balls at a strike rate of 190.30 and the left-hander passed the milestone himself in 32 balls in the 10th over, doing so with the 11th four of his innings, down to third.\n\nThere was even a stage where it looked as if Duckett might be on course to break Gilbert Jessop's 122-year-old record for England's fastest Test century, but his innings came to an end on 71 from 59 balls, including 14 fours, when he became Shamar Joseph's first scalp of the series after edging the seamer to Jason Holder.\n\nThe introduction of spinner Kevin Sinclair, in for the ill Gudakesh Motie, helped slow the run-rate for England as well following Duckett's dismissal, with Pope being dropped on 47 from a difficult chance for Athanaze off Seales in the final over before lunch.\n\nEngland's vice-captain would go on to reach his 13th Test 50 two overs into the afternoon session, but a change of ball after the original one went out of shape yielded an immediate result for the West Indies.\n\nIt was Seales who got the wicket of Joe Root, sending down a couple of testers followed by a horrible shot from the Yorkshireman which went up high and dropped for Alzarri Joseph to eventually make the catch.\n\nPope, meanwhile, was put down on 54 in the 31st over as neither Holder nor Kavem Hodge could make the catch in the slips and then Harry Brook, who had come out firing with five early fours, was put down at gully by Athanaze off Alzarri Joseph on 24 fours overs later.\n\nSinclair eventually accounted for Brook (36 from 34 balls) in the 42nd over though as the batter attempted a scoop-sweep but got the toe-end of the bat on the ball and popped it up to short leg Kirk McKenzie, ending a fourth-wicket stand of 59 in the process.\n\nYet Pope remained unbowed and, after being denied reaching it with a four at the start of the 47th over due to the runs being given as leg-byes, passed the century mark by pulling Seales square to the boundary with his 14th four of his innings to that point.\n\nHe and skipper Ben Stokes saw England through to 259-4 at tea, but their partnership was ended on 80 in the 58th over as Hodge clung on for a superb catch after Pope slashed at a delivery from Alzarri Joseph.\n\nStokes ploughed on to reach 50 for the 32nd time in Tests five overs later, only to depart for 69 when he pulled Hodge to substitute fielder Jeremiah Lewis, on for the cramp-stricken Shamar Joseph, on the square-leg boundary to become the spinner's first wicket at this level.\n\nThe slow-left armer claimed his second in the 78th over, with Jamie Smith unable to build on his impressive debut half-century after holing out to Holder at long-on for 36 just one ball after clattering a six back down the ground.\n\nSinclair got in on the act as well, accounting for Gus Atkinson (2), and the West Indies taking the new ball in the 87th over saw Seales and Alzarri Joseph remove Chris Woakes (37) and Shoaib Bashir (5) respectively, with the tourists to begin the reply in the morning on day two.\n\nWatch day two of the second Test between England and

start against West Indies", "body": "Nottingham (United Kingdom) (AFP) - Ben Duckett's quick-fire 71 ensured England made a rapid start to the second Test against the West Indies at Trent Bridge, with the hosts racing to 134-2 at lunch on Thursday's first day.\n\nEngland, sent in by West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite, lost Duckett's fellow opener Zak Crawley to just the third ball of the match.\n\nBut Ben Stokes' side still surged to 50 in a mere 4.2 overs -- the quickest a side have reached that total in a Test match.\n\nAs a result, this was also the highest total after five overs of a Test.\n\nLeft-hander Duckett, on his Nottinghamshire home ground, led the counter-attack with a 59-ball innings featuring 56 runs in boundaries, courtesy of 14 fours.\n\nDuckett, however, was out shortly before lunch, edging a good-length ball from Shamar Joseph to second slip, where Jason Holder held a fine low catch as the towering all-rounder moved forward.\n\nHis exit ended a second-wicket partnership of 105 in 19 overs with Ollie Pope.\n\nThe England vice-captain then hit the first six of the match when he lofted Shamar Joseph high over long leg.\n\nPope, though, should have been out just before the interval when a square-cut off Jayden Seales was dropped by Alick Athanaze.\n\nPope was 47 not out at lunch, with Joe Root unbeaten on 13.\n\nBrathwaite's decision to field after winning the toss was understandable given his side had been dismissed for just 121 and 136 during an innings and 114-run defeat in the first Test at Lord's last week.\n\nIt took West Indies just three balls to strike on Thursday, with Crawley edging an excellent delivery from Alzarri Joseph low to third slip, where a diving Athanaze held a fine catch.\n\nBut Duckett, whose partner is soon due to give birth, took the attack straight back to the West Indies with four fours in consecutive balls off fast bowler Seales during a second over that cost 19 in total.\n\nHolder came into the attack but was unable to staunch the flow of runs, with Duckett cover-driving and straight-driving the former West Indies captain for two more commanding boundaries.\n\nEngland are looking for a win that would clinch the three-match series with one Test to spare.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Duckett",

Opening batsman Zak Crawley (duck) was caught in the slip cordon by Alick Athanaze off the bowling of Alzarri Joseph with the English yet to put a run on the board.\n\nThe hosts wrested the momentum away swiftly, though, as Pope and Ben Duckett (71 off 59 balls) put on a 105-run stand for the second wicket -- taking England's score to the 50-run mark inside the first five overs of the game. The left-handed Duckett was the aggressor in the partnership, and he raced to his half-century off just 32 balls -- the joint third-fastest fifty for England in Tests.\n\nAfter a spell of pressure from the West Indies, fast bowler Shamar Joseph (one for 44) got the wicket of Duckett who edged a delivery to Jason Holder at second slip to leave England on 105 for two in the 19th over.\n\nEngland's scoring rate wasn't stalled, though, and they struck 50 fours and four sixes in their innings as their run rate hovered around five runs per over for most of day one.\n\nAided by a pair of dropped catches from Athanaze and Holder with his score on 46 and 54 respectively, Pope punished the Windies bowlers and got to his sixth Test century off 143 balls -- hitting a total of 15 fours and the solitary six in his knock.\n\nThe hosts progressed to 259 for four at the Tea interval after the dismissals of Joe Root (14) and Harry Brook (36).\n\nWith the set Pope and skipper Ben Stokes at the crease, the English were intent on driving home their advantage in the final session. The West Indies bowlers managed to put up a fight, and they got the remaining six wickets in the session, while England added 157 runs.\n\nPope was removed by the expensive Alzarri, who claimed three for 98 from 15.3 overs, with the dangerous Stokes (69 off 104 balls) being dismissed by part-timer Kavem Hodge (two for 44) who picked up his first Test wicket in the process.\n\nJamie Smith and Chris Woakes made 36 and 37 respectively as England's lower order kept the attacking impetus, with the latter being dismissed by Jayden Seales (two for 90) in the dying stages of the final session as the West Indies took the second new ball.\n\nAlzarri brought an end to the hosts' innings when he had last-man Shoaib Bashir caught at slip by Holder for five.\n\nAfter scoring a combined 257 runs in two innings in the first Test, the West Indies batsmen will need to come to the party on day two for the regional team to stay alive in the series.\n\nSummarised Scores:\n\nENGLAND -- 416 from 88.3 overs (Ollie Pope 121, Ben Duckett 71, Ben Stokes 69, Chris Woakes 37;

The duo shared a 105-run stand for the second wicket after Zak Crawley fell to the third ball of the match, lined up by Alzarri Joseph with a back-of-a-length delivery which drew a chunky edge and flew to Alick Athanaze at third slip.\n\nPope went on to reach 121 off 167 balls, his sixth Test century and second this year after his 196 against India in January. Stokes made 69 before he sent Kavem Hodge's 14th ball straight to deep midwicket with England 342 for 6. Left-arm spinner Hodge had entered the attack in the 68th over and ended up with 2 for 44 off 10 overs with a hand in two more dismissals, catching both Pope and Gus Atkinson in the slips.\n\nStokes, Jamie Smith and Atkinson fell for 28 runs in the space of 7.2 overs but by the close, the hosts were all out for 416, soft dismissals taking some of the shine off their innings.\n\nWest Indies skipper Kraigg Brathwaite said upon winning the toss and sending England in on a welcoming batting surface under clear skies that he wanted more discipline from his bowlers following a heavy innings defeat in the first Test at Lord's. At times, they put England's batters under pressure but West Indies gave away too many chances with the ball and in the field.\n\nPope rode his luck after being dropped on 46 in the final over before lunch when he struck a Jayden Seales delivery hard towards wide gully where Athanaze failed to hold on. The tourists gave him another life on 54 when he slashed Shamar Joseph to second slip, Jason Holder the culprit this time.\n\nHarry Brook punished some wayward line and length from Alzarri Joseph with three consecutive fours before being dropped on 24 at gully.\n\nBrook had arrived at 142 for 3 when Joe Root fell shortly after lunch to a fluffed pull which flew straight to mid-on. Seales' heart was in his mouth as Alzarri Joseph juggled the ball twice before grabbing it for good.\n\nBrook moved to 30 with an effortless six over deep point off Alzarri Joseph and up to then, he and Pope had added 10 further fours within the first hour of the afternoon session.\n\nBut Brook fell attempting to paddle Kevin Sinclair - a late inclusion after Gudakesh Motie woke up feeling unwell - and succeeded only in sending a toe-end high towards midwicket, where Kirk McKenzie swallowed the catch.\n\nPope brought up his century with four off Seales over square leg then, adding to West Indies woes, Shamar Joseph hobbled off the field midway through his 12th over - the last before tea - clutching a cramping left leg. The tourists could take some comfort from Pope's dismissal, however, driving at Alzarri Joseph and the ball ballooning to Hodge.\n\nSmith had put on 61 runs with Stokes, smashing Hodge for six beyond deep midwicket in the process before thumping another down the ground, but Hodge responded next ball when Smith attempted a similar shot and picked out Holder in the deep, continuing the trend of soft dismissals for England.\n\nAfter surviving a missed stumping, Mark Wood was dropped by Mikyle Louis diving forwards at point off Sinclair, continuing that other unwanted theme for West Indies.\n\nThe visitors took the second new ball after 86 overs and Jayden Seales and Alzarri Joseph used it to prise out the last two wickets, Chris Woakes for 37 and Shoaib Bashir for 5.\n\nDespite the imminent arrival of his first child, Duckett had been supremely focused in the middle. He found the boundary four times in a row off Seales in the second over, two glorious extra cover drives bookending a cut in front of point and a clip through midwicket. He helped himself to two more in Seales' next over and another, off Alzarri Joseph, brought up England's fifty in just 26 balls, the fastest for any team in Tests.\n\nHolder conceded just one run when he was brought on in the sixth over but was soon dispatched over extra cover by Duckett, who brought up his fifty off just 32 balls guiding Holder for four through deep third.\n\nIt was Sinclair and Shamar Joseph who found some control for West Indies after the first drinks break, but Duckett threatened to break free when he lunged forward to sweep a full delivery from Sinclair for four to bring up England's hundred and punished a wide one from Shamar Joseph through the covers. Shamar Joseph finally broke through when he drew an outside edge from Duckett and Holder held on at second slip.\n\nBrief scores:\n\nEngland 416 in 88.3 overs (Ollie Pope 121, Ben Duckett 71, Harry Brook 36, Ben Stokes 69, Jamie Smith 36, Chris Woakes 37; Alzarri Joseph 3-98, Jayden Seales 2-90, Kevin Sinclair 2-73, Kaveem Hodge 2-44) vs West Indies", "source": {"uri": "island.lk", "dataType":

Despite losing Zak Crawley in the first over, England reached lunch at 134-2, with the West Indies failing to capitalize on winning the toss. Joe Root and Harry Brook fell in the afternoon session, but Pope's resilience saw him reach his first Test century since January against India. He eventually fell for 121, with captain Ben Stokes contributing a half-century to help England amass a first-innings total of 416.\n\nWest Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite got off to an ideal start with Alzarri Joseph dismissing Zak Crawley for a duck. However, Duckett and Pope stabilized the innings, with Duckett particularly aggressive against Jayden Seales, helping England reach 50 in just 26 balls. Duckett was dismissed for 71 from 59 balls by Shamar Joseph, but his aggressive approach had already set a strong foundation for England.\n\nPope capitalized on two dropped catches to reach his 13th Test fifty early in the afternoon session. Despite a change of ball favoring the West Indies and costing Joe Root his wicket, Pope remained steadfast. He was eventually dismissed five overs after tea, having scored 121, with his century marked by a boundary off Seales.\n\nStokes continued to push England's score, reaching his 50th half-century in Tests before falling for 69. Contributions from the lower order, including Jamie Smith's 36 and Chris Woakes' 37, ensured England crossed the 400-run mark before being all out just before the close of play.\n\nOllie Pope, speaking to Sky Sports Cricket:\n\n\"It was a really good day, but we also feel we left a couple out there which is a really good sign for us as a batting unit. When you get put into bat and put 416 on the board, you can't complain about that. The pressure Ben Duckett put back on the West Indies bowlers was class and that took the pressure out of it for me.\"\n\nFormer West Indies bowler Ian Bishop, speaking on Sky Sports Cricket:\n\n\"I would say it's a day which, from a West Indies perspective, could have been better but could have been worse. They'll be happy to have taken all 10 English wickets today, but they'll be disappointed at the run-rate which they allowed England to fly off to and continue with through the day. With a couple of batters who got set and a hundred for Pope, I think England will say maybe we gave away two or three more wickets than we should have.\"\n\nFormer England bowler Stuart Broad on the Pavilion End at Trent Bridge being renamed after him:\n\n\"Hearing on commentary that a bowler is coming on from the Stuart Broad End still feels quite surreal. Trent Bridge played such a big role in my inspiration and enthusiasm for the game. I grew up watching my Dad here. I ran onto the outfield every lunch and tea break. Then I was lucky enough to play for Nottinghamshire and represent England here. I don't view it as an end named after me but named after my family and the relationship we have with the city of Nottingham, the county, and the club.\"", "source": {"uri": "pattayaone.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pattaya One News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Pope", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Duckett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ben Duckett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Indies"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Crawley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zak Crawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Root", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Root"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_cricket_team_in_the_West_Indies_in_2020\u201321", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lankan cricket team in the West Indies in 2020\u201321"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Brook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Brook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzarri_Joseph", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alzarri Joseph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Bridge", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Bridge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stokes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Stokes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraigg_Brathwaite", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kraigg Brathwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Woakes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Woakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duck (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caught"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottinghamshire_County_Cricket_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Broad", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stuart Broad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nottingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://pattayaone.news/storage/2024/07/Ollie-Pope-Century-Dominates-Day-One-vs-West-Indies.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743607", "eventUri": "eng-9743607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

second Test - Jamaica Observer", "body": "NOTTINGHAM, United Kingdom (AFP) -- Ollie Pope rode his luck to an unbeaten century as England reached 259-4 at tea on the first day of the second Test against the West Indies at Trent Bridge on Thursday.\n\nPope, dropped twice, was 115 not out, with England captain Ben Stokes unbeaten on 15.\n\nEarlier, Ben Duckett had launched the innings with a rapid 71 after fellow opener Zak Crawley fell for a duck.\n\nA youthful West Indies side harmed their own cause by missing several chances.\n\nPope should have been out for 46 when a square-cut off Jayden Seales was dropped by Alick Athanaze at backward point.\n\nThe England vice-captain was reprieved again on 54 when the usually reliable Jason Holder floored a chest-high chance at second slip following Pope's loose drive off Shamar Joseph.\n\nWest Indies did dismiss Joe Root for 14 when he top-edged a pull off Seales, but even then Alzarri Joseph almost floored what should have been a simple catch before grabbing the ball one-handed at the third attempt.\n\nHarry Brook fell for 24, caught by Kirk McKenzie following a toe-ended sweep off Kevin Sinclair.\n\nOff-spinner Sinclair, only included on Thursday morning after Gudakesh Motie withdrew because of illness, celebrated with his trademark somersault.\n\nPope pressed on for his sixth century in 45 Tests and first against the West Indies. the 26-year-old reached the landmark when he hammered Seales for a 15th four in 143 balls faced.\n\nEngland had been sent into bat by West Indies Captain Kraigg Brathwaite in sunny conditions, seemingly ideal for batting.\n\nYet Brathwaite's decision was understandable after his side was dismissed for just 121 and 136 during an innings and 114-run defeat in the first Test at Lord's last week.\n\nIt took West Indies just three balls to strike on Thursday, with Crawley edging an excellent delivery from Alzarri Joseph low to third slip, where a diving Athanaze held a fine catch.\n\nBut with Duckett leading the way -- he hit four successive fours off the second over of the match from Seales -- England surged to 50 in a mere 4.2 overs, the quickest a side have reached that total in a Test match.\n\nLeft-hander Duckett produced a sparkling 59-ball innings on his Nottinghamshire home ground, with 56 runs of his runs coming via 14 fours.\n\nDuckett was out shortly before lunch, edging a good-length ball from Shamar Joseph to second slip, where towering all-rounder Holder held a fine low catch.\n\nDuckett's exit ended a second-wicket partnership of 105 in 19 overs with Pope.\n\nAt tea, Alzarri Joseph had expensive figures of 1-61 in 10 overs, with new-ball partner Seales (1-69 in 12) also proving costly.\n\nEngland are seeking a win that would clinch the three-match series with one Test to spare.\n\nThis was their first match since James Anderson retired from international duty with 704 Test wickets -- the most by any fast bowler -- following the Lord's Test.\n\nIt was also England's first home Test since 2012 without either Anderson or long time new-ball partner Stuart Broad, who bowed out after last year's Ashes.\n\nBefore play started Thursday, the Pavilion End at Trent Bridge was officially renamed the Stuart Broad End in honour of the former Nottinghamshire seamer.", "source": {"uri": "jamaicaobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Start your free trial today >\n\nDAY ONE: Windies rue costly missed chances after another record Bazball blitz\n\nOllie Pope got lucky and reached the hundred mark, meaning England ended the first day of the second Test match against the West Indies at Trent Bridge on Thursday in a commanding position with 416 all out.\n\nBoth sides had reason to be frustrated, with West Indies dropping four catches, Pope being given two reprieves and wicketkeeper Joshua Da Silva missing a stumping, while several England batsmen gave away their wickets.\n\nEngland opener Ben Duckett began the innings with a quick 71 after fellow opener Zak Crawley scored a 'duck'. England reached 50 in just 4.2 overs. It was the fastest time any team has ever reached in a Test match.\n\nUnfortunately we lost a wicket in the first over but the pressure Ben Duckett put on the West Indian bowlers was class, Pope told Sky Sports after stumps\n\nIt took the pressure off me.\n\n\"It's such a fast scoring spot. The outfield is lightning fast. It's a great place to bat,\" he added.\n\nDuckett's innings was very much in the spirit of Bazball, the nickname for England's aggressive style of Test cricket under captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum.\n\nBut despite his belief in such a bold approach, few English cricketers are better at re-creating a match situation than Stokes, who made a measured 69 from 108 balls on Thursday.\n\nBut with West Indian Shamar Joseph, who collapsed in the last over before tea, missing and the attack seemingly at his mercy, Stokes removed Kavem Hodge to give the part-time spinner his first Test wicket. Jamie Smith, who had just hit a fine 70 on debut during England's crushing innings and 114-run victory in the first Test at Lords last week, also donated his wicket to Hodge.\n\nOff-spinner Kevin Sinclair was only called up to the team on Thursday morning after Gudakesh Motie called in sick. However, the 24-year-old produced a solid 2-73 from 22 overs and produced an impressive celebratory backflip when Harry Brook hit the toe-end to short leg.\n\nI think we've done a fantastic job, Sinclair told the BBC.\n\nThat said, we put Pope up a couple of times and he scored a hundred, so that hurt us a bit.\n\nWest Indies eventually defeated England when Alzarri Joseph (3-98 in 15.3 overs) got No. 11 Shoaib Bashir in the slips to end play for the day.\n\nEarlier, Pope was dropped on 46 by Alick Athanaze at backward point and again on 54 by the usually reliable Jason Holder at second slip.\n\nBut the England vice-captain's luck ran out when he was brilliantly caught by Hodge high above his head at first slip against Alzarri Joseph, ending a 167-ball innings that had seen 15 fours and a six, and a stand of 80 against Stokes.\n\nWest Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite won the toss and decided to bowl, despite sunny conditions that looked ideal for batting.\n\nYet his decision was understandable as the West Indians scored only 121 and 136 runs in the House of Lords.\n\nWest Indies needed just three balls to strike. Crawley drove a superb cross from Alzarri Joseph low to third slip, where a diving Athanaze made a fine catch.\n\nBut England soon regained the initiative when Duckett hit four consecutive fours against Jayden Seales in the second over of the match.\n\nThe left-handed bowler scored 56 runs in boundaries alone, thanks to 14 fours, on his home ground in Nottinghamshire, before being dismissed shortly before lunch when he beat Shamar Joseph to second slip, where the impressive all-rounder Holder took a superb low catch.\n\nDuckett's exit ended a second-wicket partnership of 105 in 19 overs with Pope as England seek a victory that would seal the three-match series with one Test remaining.\n\nThis was their first match since James Anderson retired from international duty, with 704 Test wickets, the most of any fast bowler after the Lords Test.\n\nIt was also England's first home Test since 2012 without Anderson or his loyal new partner Stuart Broad, who withdrew after last year's Ashes.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bazball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

But Duckett smashed four boundaries in a row to get started and sped to his fifty off just 32 balls.\n\nThe left-hander looked well on course for his fourth Test century until he pushed at a full ball from Shamar Joseph and nicked a low catch to Jason Holder at second slip.\n\nPope, dropped by Athanaze at gully just before lunch, should also have been caught by Holder after the interval before Joe Root, on 14, top-edged an attempted pull off Jayden Seales and skied a catch to Alzarri.\n\nHarry Brook moved briskly to 36 which included a six over backward point before he edged a paddle sweep off off-spinner Kevin Sinclair to Kirk McKenzie at short leg, as the bowler celebrated with a backward somersault.\n\nPope, however, had grown in confidence and moved to his hundred with a crisp four through the square-leg region before removing his helmet and raising his bat to\n\nthe crowd.\n\nHe edged a catch to Kavem Hodge off Alzarri, but captain Ben Stokes made a welcome return to form with the bat, hitting eight fours in his 69 before being caught off part-time spinner Hodge.\n\nKeeper-batter Jamie Smith (36) and seamer all-rounder Chris Woakes (37) chipped in down the order and England will feel confident of taking advantage of a positive start to move 2-0 up in the series following their innings victory in the first Test at Lord's.\n\nEngland made one change from the side that won the opening Test by an innings at Lord's. Pacer Mark Wood came in for the now-retired James Anderson.\n\nThe Windies were forced into one last-minute alteration with Sinclair replacing left-arm spinner Gudakesh Motie, who was down with illness. They were scheduled to go in unchanged in this game.\n\nIf the West Indies' decision to bowl first on a good batting wicket looked bizarre, their bowling was extremely poor. They had the ideal start when Crawley departed in the very first over of the game, but since then, they kept losing the advantage with their lousy bowling, particularly to Duckett.\n\nTheir three frontline qu\u00adicks -- Alzarri, Seales and Holder -- conceded as many as 168 in 30 overs with only two maidens, which underlines how erratic they were and had no control whatsoever on their lines and lengths. It was due to Shamar bowling with some discipline late in the first session that reduced England's scoring rate to an extent.\n\nAt one point, with Duckett dealing in boundaries, England were scoring in excess of eight runs an over.\n\nThere's more reason to wo\u00adrry for the Windies as Shamar walked off the ground after halfway into his 12th over, which was also the 53rd of England's first innings. It was the same left hamstring -- which had troubled him at Lord's last week -- that seemed to be bugging him here as well.\n\nCaptain Kraigg Brathwaite had to bowl the remaining three balls of that over. Sh\u00adamar, in fact, was seen struggling with his line in his second spell after five tight overs.", "source": {"uri": "telegraphindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors":

But Ben Stokes' side still surged to 50 in a mere 4.2 overs -- the quickest a side have reached that total in a Test match. As a result, this was also the highest total after five overs of a Test.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLeft-hander Duckett, on his Nottinghamshire home ground, led the counter-attack with a 59-ball innings featuring 56 runs in boundaries, courtesy of 14 fours. Duckett, however, was out shortly before lunch, edging a good-length ball from Shamar Joseph to second slip, where Jason Holder held a fine low catch as the towering all-rounder moved forward. His exit ended a second-wicket partnership of 105 in 19 overs with Ollie Pope.\n\nThe England vice-captain then hit the first six of the match when he lofted Shamar Joseph high over long leg. Pope, though, should have been out just before the interval when a square-cut off Jayden Seales was dropped by Alick Athanaze. Pope was 47 not out at lunch, with Joe Root unbeaten on 13.\n\nBrathwaite's decision to field after winning the toss was understandable given his side had been dismissed for just 121 and 136 during an innings and 114-run defeat in the first Test at Lord's last week. It took West Indies just three balls to strike on Thursday, with Crawley edging an excellent delivery from Alzarri Joseph low to third slip, where a diving Athanaze held a fine catch.\n\nAlso Read: When cricket legend Lillee pledged to face Tendulkar with helmet on\n\nBut Duckett, whose partner is soon due to give birth, took the attack straight back to the West Indies with four fours in consecutive balls off fast bowler Seales during a second over that cost 19 in total.

As well as Pope's twin reprieve, there were two more drops and a missed stumping as they failed to back their bowlers.\n\nEngland showed a flippant streak as a host of batters fell to sloppy shots but a scoring rate of 4.70 and a tally of 50 fours and four sixes suggested they were controlling the tempo.\n\nThe West Indies attack battled hard after a couple of fitness setbacks, with first-choice spinner Gudakesh Motie a late withdrawal through illness and Shamar Joseph restricted to 11.3 overs by a bout of cramp.\n\nVisiting captain Kraigg Brathwaite sprung a surprise at the toss when he sent England in to bat, a gamble that quickly came good when Alzarri Joseph snagged Zak Crawley's outside edge with the third ball of the match.\n\nEngland, though, were entirely unfazed by the early loss. Duckett, whose participation in the match had been in doubt due to the imminent arrival of his first child, batted like a man in a hurry to move things long, setting a rollicking pace in the morning session.\n\nDriving and cutting with utter conviction, the left-hander propelled his side to 50 quicker than any other in Test history, in just 26 balls, and reached his own half-century in 32. Only Sir Ian Botham and Jonny Bairstow have ever done it faster for England.\n\nEngland\u00b4s Ben Duckett is expecting the birth of his first child (Nigel French/PA)\n\nDuckett launched his foray in the second over, hijacking 19 off Jayden Seales. The seamer started with a wide and then saw each of his next four balls drilled to the ropes.\n\nTreating the situation like a T20 powerplay on his home ground, Duckett threw his hands at anything wide or overpitched as he stacked up 14 boundaries.\n\nThe arrival of Holder briefly settled the scoring rate, and almost teased a return catch from Pope on 16, but Duckett was soon back on top. His hopes of converting his rapid half-century into three figures before lunch were ended by Shamar Joseph, who lined him up from round the wicket and had him well caught at second slip.\n\nHad Athanaze held on to Pope in the last over before lunch, it might have changed things, but the chance tumbled to the turf and allowed England to rest easy on 134 for two.\n\nA messy exit from Joe Root, hacking Seales to mid-on, lifted the West Indies but more mistakes were coming, Holder botching a regulation chance in the cordon to give Pope another stroke of luck and Athanaze parrying Harry Brook at gully.\n\nThe Yorkshireman was still impatient, scooping Kevin Sinclair to short-leg for 36 to tee up an acrobatic somersault celebration from the spinner. Pope made sure not to let his chance slip, maturing as the innings went on and picking off a steady supply of loose offerings.\n\nHe reached his ton in style, sweeping Sinclair for four then stepping back to pull Seales through midwicket. Pope, who had Arsenal and England goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale in the stands as his guest, looked in control by the time Alzarri Joseph finally took an edge that stuck but England had plenty in the tank.\n\nStokes pulled powerfully as he ended a run of low scores with a punchy half-century, while Jamie Smith smashed two sixes in a cameo of 36. Both men were caught trying to hammer poor deliveries from the slow bowlers, while Gus Atkinson was nicely caught at slip.\n\nMark Wood survived two near misses, Josh Da Silva missing a stumping and Mikyle Louis putting one down at point, but Holder clung on to Chris Woakes (37) and Shoaib Bashir to wrap up the innings by stumps.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

Earlier, Ben Duckett had launched the innings with a rapid 71 after fellow opener Zak Crawley fell for a duck.\n\nA youthful West Indies side harmed their own cause by missing several chances. Pope should have been out for 46 when a square-cut off Jayden Seales was dropped by Alick Athanaze at backward point.\n\nThe England vice-captain was reprieved again on 54 when the usually reliable Jason Holder floored a chest-high chance at second slip following Pope\u00b4s loose drive off Shamar Joseph. West Indies did dismiss Joe Root for 14 when he top-edged a pull off Seales, but even then Alzarri Joseph almost floored what should have been a simple catch before grabbing the ball one-handed at the third attempt.\n\nHarry Brook fell for 24, caught by Kirk McKenzie following a toe-ended sweep off Kevin Sinclair. Off-spinner Sinclair, only included on Thursday morning after Gudakesh Motie withdrew because of illness, celebrated with his trademark somersault.\n\nPope pressed on for his sixth century in 45 Tests and first against the West Indies. the 26-year-old reached the landmark when he hammered Seales for a 15th four in 143 balls faced. England had been sent into bat by West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite in sunny conditions, seemingly ideal for batting.\n\nYet Brathwaite\u00b4s decision was understandable after his side was dismissed for just 121 and 136 during an innings and 114-run defeat in the first Test at Lord\u00b4s last week. It took West Indies just three balls to strike on Thursday, with Crawley edging an excellent delivery from Alzarri Joseph low to third slip, where a diving Athanaze held a fine catch. But with Duckett leading the way -- he hit four successive fours off the second over of the match from Seales -- England surged to 50 in a mere 4.2 overs, the quickest a side have reached that total in a Test match.\n\nLeft-hander Duckett produced a sparkling 59-ball innings on his Nottinghamshire home ground, with 56 runs of his runs coming via 14 fours.\n\nBowling: Alzarri Joseph 14-1-85-2,

Ben Stokes and his men created the record during the second Test between England and West Indies played at Trent Bridge, Nottingham.\n\nOn a slow wicket, the new ball came onto the bat nicely. Despite losing an early wicket, Ben Duckett played his natural game and kept attacking the poor lines and lengths of West Indian fast bowlers.\n\nAlso read: 'Humne gaaliyan khaai thi' - Munaf Patel reveals how MS Dhoni's men made Gary Kirsten apologize to Team India\n\nAfter being put into bat by the West Indies, England switched on their Bazball mode. Despite losing Zak Crawley in just the third ball of the match, England's batters kept up the scoring rate as they took full toll of some loose bowling by West Indies' opening bowlers.\n\nBen Duckett was the wrecker-in-chief as the opener showed his full strange of strokes. The left-hander was particularly impressive through the off-side as he kept smashing the ball through covers and point region.\n\nIn just the second over of the match, Ben Duckett counter-attacked by smashing all the first four balls for boundaries. When Alzarri Joseph tried to duck him with a short ball, Duckett latched on to it and pulled through the midwicket region.\n\nEngland completed its fifty in just 4.2 overs when Ben Duckett smashed Alzarri Joseph for a four through the covers. With this boundary, England broke their own record of the fastest team fifty in Test cricket. England held the earlier record when they scored the team fifty off just 4.3 overs against South Africa at The Oval in 1994.\n\nSince 2022, England have recorded most (six) completed Test innings with a run rate of above 5 runs per over, which is the most among all the teams.\n\nMost of Duckett's boundaries were through the covers region. In the process, he also completed 10000 runs in first-class cricket. The left-hander completed his fifty off just 32 balls. Meanwhile, England's vice-captain Ollie Pope played the perfect role of a second fiddle. The duo of Duckett and Pope smashed 20 fours on their way to the world record.\n\nDuckett was dismissed for a breathtaking 71 off 59 balls, which included 14 fours. But Ollie Pope carried on and kept the run rate ticking along. England's No. 3 played perfectly for his 47 off 75 balls and remained unbeaten till lunch. Pope has smashed 5 fours and 1 six so far and looks set for a big one on a good batting surface at Trent Bridge.\n\nMeanwhile, Joe Root is unbeaten on 13 off 20 balls till lunch. Both Pope and Root have taken England to 134-2 in just 26 overs till the end of the first session of the match.

As well as Pope's twin reprieve, there were two more drops and a missed stumping as they failed to back their bowlers.\n\nEngland showed a flippant streak as a host of batters fell to sloppy shots but a scoring rate of 4.70 and a tally of 50 fours and four sixes suggested they were controlling the tempo.\n\nThe West Indies attack battled hard after a couple of fitness setbacks, with first-choice spinner Gudakesh Motie a late withdrawal through illness and Shamar Joseph restricted to 11.3 overs by a bout of cramp.\n\nVisiting captain Kraigg Brathwaite sprung a surprise at the toss when he sent England in to bat, a gamble that quickly came good when Alzarri Joseph snagged Zak Crawley's outside edge with the third ball of the match.\n\nEngland, though, were entirely unfazed by the early loss. Duckett, whose participation in the match had been in doubt due to the imminent arrival of his first child, batted like a man in a hurry to move things long, setting a rollicking pace in the morning session.\n\nDriving and cutting with utter conviction, the left-hander propelled his side to 50 quicker than any other in Test history, in just 26 balls, and reached his own half-century in 32. Only Sir Ian Botham and Jonny Bairstow have ever done it faster for England.\n\nDuckett launched his foray in the second over, hijacking 19 off Jayden Seales. The seamer started with a wide and then saw each of his next four balls drilled to the ropes.\n\nTreating the situation like a T20 powerplay on his home ground, Duckett threw his hands at anything wide or overpitched as he stacked up 14 boundaries.\n\nThe arrival of Holder briefly settled the scoring rate, and almost teased a return catch from Pope on 16, but Duckett was soon back on top. His hopes of converting his rapid half-century into three figures before lunch were ended by Shamar Joseph, who lined him up from round the wicket and had him well caught at second slip.\n\nHad Athanaze held on to Pope in the last over before lunch, it might have changed things, but the chance tumbled to the turf and allowed England to rest easy on 134 for two.\n\nA messy exit from Joe Root, hacking Seales to mid-on, lifted the West Indies but more mistakes were coming, Holder botching a regulation chance in the cordon to give Pope another stroke of luck and Athanaze parrying Harry Brook at gully.\n\nThe Yorkshireman was still impatient, scooping Kevin Sinclair to short-leg for 36 to tee up an acrobatic somersault celebration from the spinner. Pope made sure not to let his chance slip, maturing as the innings went on and picking off a steady supply of loose offerings.\n\nHe reached his ton in style, sweeping Sinclair for four then stepping back to pull Seales through midwicket. Pope, who had Arsenal and England goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale in the stands as his guest, looked in control by the time Alzarri Joseph finally took an edge that stuck but England had plenty in the tank.\n\nStokes pulled powerfully as he ended a run of low scores with a punchy half-century, while Jamie Smith smashed two sixes in a cameo of 36.

Still, it was not all bad news for the visitors during the session.\n\nSeales got Joe Root caught at mid-on for 14 from a miscued pull, and Sinclair got Brook caught at short leg from a top-edged paddle-scoop after the young England batsman dominated a stand of 59 for the fourth wicket with Pope.\n\nAfter tea, Alzarri Joseph got Pope caught at slip in the fifth over, but Stokes, with whom he added 80 for the fifth wicket, carried on merrily to reach his 50 from 71 balls.\n\nIn an effort to improve the over rate and rest the pacers before the second new ball, West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite gave Hodge an extended spell, and the part-timer captured his first Test wicket when he got Stokes caught at deep mid-wicket after the England captain put on 61 for the sixth wicket with Smith.\n\nHodge added the scalp of Smith caught at long-on, and Sinclair got Gus Atkinson caught at slip for two before Brathwaite claimed the second new ball, with which Seales and Alzarri Joseph brought a topsy-turvy day for West Indies to a close with the last two English wickets.\n\nThe Caribbean side trail 1-0 in the three-match series after they lost the first Test that ended last Friday - inside three days - by an innings and 114 runs at Lord's.", "source": {"uri": "jamaica-gleaner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jamaica Gleaner"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Duckett and Pope took England's score to the 50-run mark inside the first five overs, with the former getting to his fifty off just 32 balls - the joint third-fastest fifty for England in Tests.\n\nOminously poised on 342 for five at one stage in the final session, the West Indies bowlers fought back to take the last five wickets for 74 runs as the day's play concluded with the fall of last-man Shoaib Bashir.\n\nJoseph led the West Indies attack with figures of three for 98, with fellow seamer Jayden Seales grabbing two for 90 - though both had economy rates of six runs per over or higher. Part-time spinner Kavem Hodge grabbed two for 44, with Kevin Sinclair, a late inclusion in the Windies lineup for the ill Gudakesh Motie, grabbing two for 73.\n\nSinclair said it spoke volumes for the bowling unit to dismiss the \"world-class\" England team for the second time in the series, but he acknowledged the West Indies let things slip.\n\n\"I don't think we wanted them to get to 400. I think it was a little too many,\" Sinclair told the media at the end of the day's play.\n\n\"We struck early and we let loose with the pressure. That's something we didn't want...I think we did the best we could today despite putting down a few chances.\"\n\nThe 26-year-old Pope cracked 121 off 167 balls with 15 fours and a solitary six before being dismissed by Joseph in the final session. However, with better catching by the visitors, he could have been back in the hut before crossing 50.\n\nIn the over before the lunch interval, Pope was on 46 when he was dropped after slashing to Alick Athanaze at gully. Just after the interval, Pope pushed his score to 54 before he was dropped by Jason Holder off Shamar Joseph's bowling. England's score was on 144 for three at the time, with Joe Root (14) having been dismissed moments before by Seales.\n\n\"We were guilty of putting down a few chances. Pope ended up getting off after being dropped. He played really well and stuck it out there and got a hundred,\" Sinclair said.\n\nDuckett and Pope aside, several other England batsmen got starts on what was described as a good batting surface, with both Harry Brook and Jamie Smith notching 36, and lower-order batsman Chris Woakes hitting 37. Skipper Ben Stokes (69 off 104 balls) also threatened to cut loose before he became Hodge's first Test wicket after going for an unsuccessful heave into the on-side.\n\nQuestions were raised about West Indies skipper Kraigg Brathwaite's decision to bowl first, although the pitch and fast outfield conditions seemed favourable for batting. Sinclair backed his skipper's choice.\n\n\"I think the skipper (Brathwaite) was very much level-headed and in control of what he wanted to do,\" Sinclair said.\n\n\"I think he wanted to put a little pressure on them and use up the wicket a bit more.\"\n\nWith the English on 259 for four at the tea interval, the West Indies were well behind the eight ball. But after grabbing six wickets in the final session of the day's play, Sinclair hopes he can do his part to help the Windies seize momentum in the encounter.\n\n\"For me, whenever I get the chance with the bat I look to be out there a bit longer to score some runs for my time,\" the 24-year-old Guyanese said.\n\n\"I just have to remain focused and focus on my all-around game. Whatever the team requires me to do, I'll do it to the best of my ability. Every time I get the chance (to play for the West Indies), I do it with passion.\"\n\nAfter scoring a combined 257 runs in two innings in the first Test, the West Indies batsmen will be expected to dig deep to give their team a shot at stunting England's dominance in the three-match series.\n\nSummarised Scores:\n\nENGLAND -- 416 from 88.3 overs (Ollie Pope 121, Ben Duckett 71, Ben Stokes 69,

Jayden Seales started the next over with a wide and went downhill from there as he shipped 19.\n\nDuckett proceeded to hit the next four balls for four, driving and cutting with absolute conviction and almost instantly reversing the momentum.\n\nEngland continued to treat the situation like a T20 powerplay, Duckett throwing his hands at anything a little wide or a fraction overpitched and Pope bright in support.\n\nBy the time Duckett laced Alzarri Joseph through cover for his seventh four, the crowd were enjoying the fastest team fifty ever seen, coming up in just 26 balls.\n\nThe introduction of Jason Holder threatened to cool the scoring rate, particularly when Pope almost offered a return catch, but Duckett was soon back on top, spraying shots through the infield.\n\nBoundary number 11 brought up his half-century, behind only Sir Ian Botham and Jonny Bairstow in terms of pace, with England haring to 76 for one after 10 overs.\n\nDuckett might just have started to eye up his prospects of reeling in Gilbert Jessop's 122-year-old record for the quickest English century but it was not to be, Shamar Joseph lining him up from round the wicket and snagging the outside edge.\n\nThe wicket helped the tourists regain some control but they wasted a chance to end the session on a high when Athanaze put Pope down at gully seconds before the break.", "source":

After opting to bowl first, the tourists drew first blood in the opening over itself as Alzarri Joseph dismissed Zak Crawley with his third delivery. However, the Caribbean side couldn't build on the initial breakthrough as Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope put on a scintillating show.\n\nDuckett and Pope hit boundaries at will and helped the Three Lions get to the 50-run mark off just 26 balls. They broke the record for the fastest team Test fifty, surpassing the previous recorded instant of a 27-ball fifty by them against South Africa at the Oval in 1994. Duckett, who was the more flamboyant of the duo, took England to 50 with a boundary off Alzarri.\n\nThe diminutive left-handed batter went on to slam his half-century in just 32 balls with a boundary off Jason Holder in the 10th over. Duckett registered the fastest fifty by an England opener and the third joint fastest for his country in the longest format of the game.\n\nDuckett's mayhem was eventually ended by Shamar Joseph, who dismissed the 29-year-old for a 59-ball 71. This was after the Farnborough-born had hit 14 boundaries during his blistering knock. He stitched a 105-run partnership off just 112 balls with Pope.\n\nAfter Duckett departed, Pope and Joe Root added 30 runs off 48 balls to take England to 134/2 at Lunch on Day 1. Pope gave a tough chance to Alick Athanaze at backward point in the last over of the session but the latter couldn't hold on. Eventually the right-handed batter finished unbeaten on 47 off 75 balls, belting five fours and a six.\n\nThe West Indies would have to regroup during the break and come out with better plans in the second session as the hosts are threatening to run away with the game.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Duckett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ben Duckett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Pope", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Crawley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zak Crawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzarri_Joseph", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alzarri Joseph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Bridge", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Bridge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_cricket_team_in_Pakistan_in_2020\u201321", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South African cricket team in Pakistan in 2020\u201321"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Holder", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Holder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oval", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Oval"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Root", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Root"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://media.crictracker.com/media/attachments/1705411793465_Ben-Duckett.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743607", "eventUri": "eng-9743607", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 104, "textEnd": 111}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Shamar Joseph and Kevin Sinclair did pull things back to an extent by delivering a few quiet overs which finally brought the run rate below six. That little spell resulted in a wicket as Duckett edged one behind to second slip to fall for 71.

The hosts are coming off a sensational win in the first Test at Lord's, where they won by an innings and 114 runs. They aim to secure another win to take over the series.\n\nWest Indies won the toss and opted to bowl first, a decision that initially paid off as Zak Crawley was dismissed for a duck in the opening over by Alzarri Joseph. It appeared from thereon that the Windies bowlers would tighten the screw more. However, Ben Duckett had some other plans as he launched a counter-attack that shifted the momentum.\n\nDuckett kicked off the proceedings right from the word go. He took Jayden Seales to the cleaners in the second over of England's innings, dispatching the bowler for 4 consecutive boundaries and collecting 19 runs, including an extra.\n\nContinuing with his aggressive approach, Duckett helped England race past 50 runs in just 4.2 overs, setting a new record for the fastest team fifty in Test history. In the 10th over, Duckett reached his half-century off just 32 balls, becoming the fourth fastest English batter to do so in Test cricket.\n\nIn fact the way was Duckett was playing, it appeared he would reach the triple figure score quite quickly and create another record. However, Shamar Joseph, with the assistance of Jason Holder's fielding brilliance, halted his innings in the 19th over.\n\nShamar went for a bowled a full delivery just outside off, which Duckett attempted to drive through the line. The ball nipped away slightly off the deck, catching a thick outside edge. The red leather traveled quickly and low to the slip cordon, where Holder took a remarkable catch.\n\nDuckett ended up scoring 71 runs from 59 deliveries, including 14 boundaries. By the end of the first session, England reached 134/2 in 26 overs, with Ollie Pope (47 not out) and Joe Root (13 not out) unbeaten at the crease.", "source": {"uri": "crickettimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketTimes.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "akshat_gaur@crickettimes.com", "name": "Akshat Gaur", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Duckett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ben Duckett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Indies"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lord's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Crawley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zak Crawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzarri_Joseph", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alzarri Joseph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Bridge", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Bridge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duck (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nottingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Seales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Seales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Pope", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crease_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crease (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Root", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Root"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://crickettimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Jason-Holder-takes-a-brilliant-catch-in-ENG-vs-WI-second-Test.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743607", "eventUri": "eng-9743607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Stabroek News", "body": "(CMC) - Six wickets after tea enabled the West Indies to bowl out England in the second Test of the Richards-Botham Trophy Series yesterday after Ollie Pope led powerful batting for the hosts with his sixth Test hundred.\n\nAlzarri Joseph and Kavem Hodge grabbed four wickets between them in the final session to spur a comeback for the Caribbean side, but the visitors could not fully overcome their earlier indiscretions, and Pope rode his luck to hit 121 before the English were dismissed for 416 in their first innings about half-hour past the scheduled close on the first day of the match.\n\nJoseph and new-ball partner Jayden Seales shared five wickets between them, but they were guilty of erratic bowling that undermined the West Indies effort after they shocked the world and decided to field on the notoriously batsman-friendly Trent Bridge pitch under sunny skies.\n\nJoseph ended with three for 98 from 15.3 overs, and Seales finished with two for 90 from 15 overs, but they were clearly not at their best, and the England batsmen feasted on them to pile up their highest first day total on home soil since World War II.\n\nOpener Ben Duckett cracked 71, England captain Ben Stokes made 69, Chris Woakes added 37, Harry Brook got a quick-fire 36, and Jamie Smith got the same score in a strong show from the English batting.\n\nFortunately, Hodge grabbed two for 44 from 10 overs with his part-time left-arm spin, and off-spinner Kevin Sinclair - a late inclusion after his left-arm spin bowling, fellow Guyanese Gudakesh Motie woke up with the flu - bagged two for 73 from 22 overs to try to limit the damage.\n\nEnergetic fast bowler Shamar Joseph was also tidier than Joseph (A) and Seales, but he limped off the field in the final over before tea with a recurrence of the leg cramps that hampered him in the first Test at Lord's, and this further hamstrung the Caribbean side.\n\nThe day started brightly for the West Indies when Joseph (A) got lanky England opener Zak Crawley caught at third slip for a duck with the third ball of the match - but the visitors soon lived to regret their decision to field when the bowlers haemorrhaged boundaries and the home team reached 134 for two at lunch.\n\nIt started to unravel for the Caribbean side when Seales conceded 19 in his first over - the second of the match - and Duckett struck him for a beaver-trick of fours, and the pacer had to be pulled out of the attack after only two overs that cost 28.\n\nJoseph (A) gave away 30 in an opening spell of five overs, and the West Indies had no answer for the onslaught, and the England total galloped to 50 from only 26 balls - the fastest known in a Test.\n\nJason Holder brought a measure of control with his medium-fast bowling, but Duckett reached his 50 from only 32 balls - the third fastest by an English batsman - when he steered the lanky paceman to third man for his 11th boundary.\n\nJoseph (S) ended the fun for Duckett, whose 59-ball knock included 14 fours, when the left-handed England opener, on his home turf, was caught at second slip during a period that the Caribbean side managed to stem the free flow of runs.\n\nSeales almost struck another important blow for the visitors in the final over before lunch when Pope, on 47, tried to cut a delivery too close to him, but gully fielder Alick Athanaze spilled a sharp chance.\n\nTwo wickets between lunch and tea kept the West Indies interested, but Pope tempered their elation when he reached his milestone from 143 balls with his 15th four flicked through square leg off Seales, and he anchored England to 259 for four at tea.\n\nThe Caribbean side had a chance to remove Pope on 54 in the fifth over after lunch, but Holder put down a regulation take at second slip off Joseph (S), but it was not all bad news for the visitors during the session.\n\nSeales got Joe Root caught at mid-on for 14 from a miscued pull, and Sinclair got Brook caught at short leg from a top-edged paddle-scoop after the young England batsman dominated a stand of 59 for the fourth wicket with Pope.\n\nAfter tea, Joseph (A) got Pope caught at slip in the fifth over, but Stokes, with whom he added 80 for the fifth wicket, carried on merrily to reach his 50 from 71 balls.\n\nIn an effort to improve the over rate and rest the pacers before the second new ball, West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite gave Hodge an extended spell, and the part-timer captured his first Test wicket when he got Stokes caught at deep mid-wicket after the England captain put on 61 for the sixth wicket with Smith.\n\nHodge added the scalp of Smith caught at long-on, and Sinclair got Gus Atkinson caught at slip for two before Brathwaite claimed the second new ball, and Seales and Joseph (A) brought a topsy-turvy day for the West Indies to a close with the last two English wickets.\n\nThe Caribbean side trail 1-0 in the three-match series after they lost the first Test that ended last Friday - inside three days - by an innings and 114 runs at Lord's.", "source": {"uri": "stabroeknews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stabroek News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The duo shared a 105-run stand for the second wicket after Zak Crawley fell to the third ball of the match, lined up by Alzarri Joseph with a back-of-a-length delivery which drew a chunky edge and flew to Alick Athanaze at third slip.\n\nPope went on to reach 121 off 167 balls, his sixth Test century and second this year after his 196 against India in January. Stokes made 69 before he sent Kavem Hodge's 14th ball straight to deep midwicket with England 342 for 6. Left-arm spinner Hodge had entered the attack in the 68th over and ended up with 2 for 44 off 10 overs with a hand in two more dismissals, catching both Pope and Gus Atkinson in the slips.\n\nStokes, Jamie Smith and Atkinson fell for 28 runs in the space of 7.2 overs but by the close, the hosts were all out for 416, soft dismissals taking some of the shine off their innings.\n\nWest Indies skipper Kraigg Brathwaite said upon winning the toss and sending England in on a welcoming batting surface under clear skies that he wanted more discipline from his bowlers following a heavy innings defeat in the first Test at Lord's. At times, they put England's batters under pressure but West Indies gave away too many chances with the ball and in the field.\n\nPope rode his luck after being dropped on 46 in the final over before lunch when he struck a Jayden Seales delivery hard towards wide gully where Athanaze failed to hold on. The tourists gave him another life on 54 when he slashed Shamar Joseph to second slip, Jason Holder the culprit this time.\n\nHarry Brook punished some wayward line and length from Alzarri Joseph with three consecutive fours before being dropped on 24 at gully.\n\nBrook had arrived at 142 for 3 when Joe Root fell shortly after lunch to a fluffed pull which flew straight to mid-on. Seales' heart was in his mouth as Alzarri Joseph juggled the ball twice before grabbing it for good.\n\nBrook moved to 30 with an effortless six over deep point off Alzarri Joseph and up to then, he and Pope had added 10 further fours within the first hour of the afternoon session.\n\nBut Brook fell attempting to paddle Kevin Sinclair - a late inclusion after Gudakesh Motie woke up feeling unwell - and succeeded only in sending a toe-end high towards midwicket, where Kirk McKenzie swallowed the catch.\n\nPope brought up his century with four off Seales over square leg then, adding to West Indies woes, Shamar Joseph hobbled off the field midway through his 12th over - the last before tea - clutching a cramping left leg. The tourists could take some comfort from Pope's dismissal, however, driving at Alzarri Joseph and the ball ballooning to Hodge.\n\nSmith had put on 61 runs with Stokes, smashing Hodge for six beyond deep midwicket in the process before thumping another down the ground, but Hodge responded next ball when Smith attempted a similar shot and picked out Holder in the deep, continuing the trend of soft dismissals for England.\n\nAfter surviving a missed stumping, Mark Wood was dropped by Mikyle Louis diving forwards at point off Sinclair, continuing that other unwanted theme for West Indies.\n\nThe visitors took the second new ball after 86 overs and Jayden Seales and Alzarri Joseph used it to prise out the last two wickets, Chris Woakes for 37 and Shoaib Bashir for 5.\n\nDespite the imminent arrival of his first child, Duckett had been supremely focused in the middle. He found the boundary four times in a row off Seales in the second over, two glorious extra cover drives bookending a cut in front of point and a clip through midwicket. He helped himself to two more in Seales' next over and another, off Alzarri Joseph, brought up England's fifty in just 26 balls, the fastest for any team in Tests.\n\nHolder conceded just one run when he was brought on in the sixth over but was soon dispatched over extra cover by Duckett, who brought up his fifty off just 32 balls guiding Holder for four through deep third.\n\nIt was Sinclair and Shamar Joseph who found some control for West Indies after the first drinks break, but Duckett threatened to break free when he lunged forward to sweep a full delivery from Sinclair for four to bring up England's hundred and punished a wide one from Shamar Joseph through the covers. Shamar Joseph finally broke through when he drew an outside edge from Duckett and Holder held on at second slip.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors":

We might be on for another lightning-quick innings victory if England's bowlers hit their mark and there is enough of an appetite in the dressing room for weekend golf.\n\nIndeed, it would take something extraordinary for the West Indies to claw this match back from here.\n\nThe good news for England was the century from Pope, his sixth in Tests, and a first since he struck 196 against India at Hyderabad back in January.\n\nPope did ride his luck, with two of those drops benefitting him before he had reached 55. He is a player who often looks nervy, especially at the start of innings. But the bottom line is he is averaging 42 since he was handed the No 3 role on a permanent basis at the start of the Bazball era two summers ago.\n\nPope's 121 here was his fifth hundred since and no England No 3 since Jonathan Trott has scored as many from the position.\n\nStokes also returned to form with the bat with his first half-century in 12 innings but will be cursing himself for holing out to the part-time spin of Kavem Hodge on 69.\n\nEarlier in the day, Ben Duckett flirted with Gilbert Jessop's 76-ball record for the fastest England Test hundred before falling for 71.\n\nThat other batters missed out, with Joe Root and Harry Brook guilty of terrible shots for their dismissals, is a negative.\n\nYet despite a late collapse that saw England lose their final five wickets for 74, this is the first time in more than a year Stokes's team have posted a 400-plus total in a home Test.\n\nThe problem is that the very fabric of Test cricket is cheapened by one-sided \"contests\" such as this.\n\nThis West Indies bowling attack was weakened by the loss of Kemar Roach before the tour began and further here when Shamar Joseph, their brightest young quick bowler, left the field for the second successive Test with cramp. They also lost spinner Gudakesh Motie to illness before play began on this first day.\n\nHowever, the standard of bowling was the worst England have faced in a long time.\n\nThere can be no criticism of the effort put in by the West Indies players. Kevin Sinclair, who filled in for Motie, plugged away manfully for his two wickets. Hodge, who had not bowled in Tests before, picked up the scalps of Stokes and Jamie Smith.\n\nBut England should have made more than they did at a venue that can be classed as the spiritual home of Bazball given this is where Jonny Bairstow scored a ludicrous 77-ball hundred during a thrilling run chase against New Zealand two summers ago that lit a fire under England's attacking new approach.\n\nDuckett channelled it early on as the hosts raced to fifty in just 26 balls.\n\nYet everything we have seen in this series feels seriously devalued.\n\nAfter Zak Crawley was dismissed to the third ball of the day from Alzarri Joseph, England needed something. Ben Duckett provided it. The opener's partner is due to give birth any day now and he batted like a man in a rush as he counter-attacked superbly to reach fifty in 32 balls. His onslaught started when he hit the first four deliveries of the second over bowled by Jayden Seales for four. He fell short of breaking Ian Botham's 28-ball record for the fastest England half-century. But it was the quickest by an England opener.\n\nGilbert's record lives on\n\nWhen he was on 67 from 53 deliveries, Duckett had looked set to break perhaps the most sought-after England batting record - the fastest England Test century (76 balls) set by Gilbert Jessop against Australia in 1902. Jonny Bairstow - a 77-ball ton at Trent Bridge two years ago against New Zealand - has come the closest to breaching Jessop's mark. But it still stands after Duckett edged Shamar Joseph to second slip, walking off with 71 from 59 balls.\n\nHack of the day\n\nThe shot that did for Joe Root shortly after lunch - caught at mid-on after an ugly attempted pull to Seales - was bad. But this innings of 14 did see Root move past Sri Lanka great Mahela Jayawardene into ninth place on the all-time list of Test runscorers. Now on 11,818 runs, Root needs 655 more to overhaul Sir Alastair Cook to become England's all-time leading Test runscorer.\n\nSinclair flips out\n\nHarry Brook was looking good as he reached 36 from 33 balls. But he was caught trying an inexplicable reverse scoop off the bowling of Kevin Sinclair. The off-spinner, only in the team because Gudakesh Motie was taken ill overnight, celebrated with a back flip that was greeted warmly by the Trent Bridge crowd.\n\nPope's no dope\n\nOllie Pope wasn't at his best but when he pulled Seales through midwicket for four in the second hour after lunch it brought up his sixth Test century and first since that epic match-winning 196 against India at Hyderabad in January. Dropped on 46 and 54, he rode his luck but cashed in to become the first Bazballer to reach three figures this summer.\n\nStat of the day\n\nWhen England brought up their fifty in 26 balls (4.2 overs) this felt like a T20 match. It was the fastest-ever a team had got to the total in Tests, beating the previous record - set by England against South Africa at The Oval in 1994 \u00ad- by one delivery.\n\nQuote of the day\n\n\"He's such a clean striker of the ball, so when these pitches come on nicely with a quick outfield, he looks in such fine form. He's not scored many runs since his brilliant hundred in India. There's no doubt the whole changing room will have been thrilled for him getting that hundred today.\"\n\nFormer England bowler Stuart Broad speaking on Sky Sports about Ollie Pope\n\nBazball-o-meter: 9/10\n\nDuckett set off like a train and England became the fastest team in Test history to reach 50 - in just 26 balls. With Pope and Stokes also in the runs, England laid waste to a poor Windies attack, scoring 400 in a day again during the Bazball era.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

Jayden Seales started the next over with a wide and went downhill from there as he shipped 19.\n\nDuckett proceeded to hit the next four balls for four, driving and cutting with absolute conviction and almost instantly reversing the momentum.\n\nEngland continued to treat the situation like a T20 powerplay, Duckett throwing his hands at anything a little wide or a fraction overpitched and Pope bright in support.\n\nBy the time Duckett laced Alzarri Joseph through cover for his seventh four, the crowd were enjoying the fastest team fifty ever seen, coming up in just 26 balls.\n\nBen Duckett was a man in a hurry (Nigel French/PA)\n\nThe introduction of Jason Holder threatened to cool the scoring rate, particularly when Pope almost offered a return catch, but Duckett was soon back on top, spraying shots through the infield.\n\nBoundary number 11 brought up his half-century, behind only Sir Ian Botham and Jonny Bairstow in terms of pace, with England haring to 76 for one after 10 overs.\n\nDuckett might just have started to eye up his prospects of reeling in Gilbert Jessop's 122-year-old record for the quickest English century but it was not to be, Shamar Joseph lining him up from round the wicket and snagging the outside edge.\n\nThe wicket helped the tourists regain some control but they wasted a chance to end the session on a high when Athanaze put Pope down at gully

wickets after tea enabled the West Indies to bowl out England in the second Test of the Richards-Botham Trophy Series yesterday after Ollie Pope led powerful batting for the hosts with his sixth Test hundred.\n\nAlzarri Joseph and Kavem Hodge grabbed four wickets between them in the final session to spur a comeback for the Caribbean side, but the visitors could not fully overcome their earlier indiscretions, and Pope rode his luck to hit 121 before the English were dismissed for 416 in their first innings about half an hour past the scheduled close on the first day of the match.\n\nJoseph and new-ball partner Jayden Seales shared five wickets between them, but they were guilty of erratic bowling that undermined the West Indies effort after they shocked the world and decided to field on the notoriously batsman-friendly Trent Bridge pitch under sunny skies.\n\nJoseph ended with three for 98 from 15.3 overs, and Seales finished with two for 90 from 15 overs, but they were clearly not at their best, and the England batsmen feasted on them to pile up their highest first-day total on home soil since World War II.\n\nOpener Ben Duckett cracked 71, England captain Ben Stokes made 69, Chris Woakes added 37, Harry Brook got a quickfire 36, and Jamie Smith got the same score in a strong show from the English batting.\n\nFortunately, Hodge grabbed two for 44 from 10 overs with his part-time left-arm spin, and off-spinner Kevin Sinclair -- a late inclusion after his left-arm spin bowling, fellow Guyanese Gudakesh Motie woke up with the flu -- bagged two for 73 from 22 overs to try to limit the damage.\n\nEnergetic fast bowler Shamar Joseph was also tidier than Joseph (A) and Seales, but he limped off the field in the final over before tea with a recurrence of the leg cramps that hampered him in the first Test at Lord's, and this further hamstrung the Caribbean side.\n\nThe day started brightly for the West Indies when Joseph (A) got lanky England opener Zak Crawley caught at third slip for a duck with the third ball of the match, but the visitors soon lived to regret their decision to field when the bowlers haemorrhaged boundaries, and the home team reached 134 for two at lunch.\n\nIt started to unravel for the Caribbean side when Seales conceded 19 in his first over -- the second of the match -- and Duckett struck him for a beaver-trick of fours, and the pacer had to be pulled out of the attack after only two overs that cost 28.\n\nJoseph (A) gave away 30 in an opening spell of five overs, and the West Indies had no answer for the onslaught, and the England total galloped to 50 from only 26 balls -- the fastest known in a Test.\n\nJason Holder brought a measure of control with his medium-fast bowling, but Duckett reached his 50 from only 32 balls -- the third fastest by an English batsman -- when he steered the lanky paceman to the third man for his 11th boundary.\n\nJoseph (S) ended the fun for Duckett, whose 59-ball knock included 14 fours, when the left-handed England opener, on his home turf, was caught at second slip during a period that the Caribbean side managed to stem the free flow of runs.\n\nSeales almost struck another important blow for the visitors in the final over before lunch when Pope, at 47, tried to cut a delivery too close to him, but gully fielder Alick Athanaze spilled a sharp chance.\n\nTwo wickets between lunch and tea kept the West Indies interested, but Pope tempered their elation when he reached his milestone of 143 balls with his 15th four flicked through the square leg off Seales, and he anchored England to 259 for four at tea.\n\nThe Caribbean side had a chance to remove Pope on 54 in the fifth over after lunch, but Holder put down a regulation take at second slip off Joseph (S), but it was not all bad news for the visitors during the session.\n\nSeales got Joe Root caught at mid-on for 14 from a miscued pull, and Sinclair got Brook caught at short leg from a top-edged paddle-scoop after the young England batsman dominated with a stand of 59 for the fourth wicket with Pope.\n\nAfter tea, Joseph (A) got Pope caught at slip in the fifth over, but Stokes, with whom he added 80 for the fifth wicket, carried on merrily to reach his 50 from 71 balls.\n\nIn an effort to improve the over rate and rest the pacers before the second new ball, West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite gave Hodge an extended spell, and the part-timer captured his first Test wicket when he got Stokes caught at deep mid-wicket after the England captain put on 61 for the sixth wicket with Smith.\n\nHodge added the scalp of Smith caught at long-on, and Sinclair got Gus Atkinson caught at slip for two before Brathwaite claimed the second new ball, and Seales and Joseph (A) brought a topsy-turvy day for the West Indies to a close with the last two English wickets.\n\nThe Caribbean side trail 1-0 in the three-match series after they lost the first Test that ended last Friday -- in three days -- by an innings and 114 runs at Lord's.\n\nSummerise Scores\n\nENGLAND 416 (Ollie Pope 121, Ben Duckett 71, Ben Stokes 69, Chris Woakes 37, Harry Brook 36, Jamie Smith 36; Alzarri Joseph 3-98, Kavem Hodge 2-44, Kevin Sinclair 2-73, Jayden Seales 2-90) vs WEST INDIES\n\nToss: West Indies.\n\nUmpires: Adrian Holdstock (South Africa), Rod Tucker (Australia).", "source": {"uri":

As well as Pope's twin reprieve, there were two more drops and a missed stumping as they failed to back their bowlers.\n\nEngland showed a flippant streak as a host of batters fell to sloppy shots but a scoring rate of 4.70 and a tally of 50 fours and four sixes suggested they were controlling the tempo.\n\nThe West Indies attack battled hard after a couple of fitness setbacks, with first-choice spinner Gudakesh Motie a late withdrawal through illness and Shamar Joseph restricted to 11.3 overs by a bout of cramp.\n\nVisiting captain Kraigg Brathwaite sprung a surprise at the toss when he sent England in to bat, a gamble that quickly came good when Alzarri Joseph snagged Zak Crawley's outside edge with the third ball of the match.\n\nEngland, though, were entirely unfazed by the early loss. Duckett, whose participation in the match had been in doubt due to the imminent arrival of his first child, batted like a man in a hurry to move things long, setting a rollicking pace in the morning session.\n\nDriving and cutting with utter conviction, the left-hander propelled his side to 50 quicker than any other in Test history, in just 26 balls, and reached his own half-century in 32. Only Sir Ian Botham and Jonny Bairstow have ever done it faster for England.\n\nTreating the situation like a T20 powerplay on his home ground, Duckett threw his hands at anything wide or overpitched as he stacked up 14 boundaries.\n\nThe arrival of Holder briefly settled the scoring rate, and almost teased a return catch from Pope on 16, but Duckett was soon back on top. His hopes of converting his rapid half-century into three figures before lunch were ended by Shamar Joseph, who lined him up from round the wicket and had him well caught at second slip.\n\nHad Athanaze held on to Pope in the last over before lunch, it might have changed things, but the chance tumbled to the turf and allowed England to rest easy on 134 for two.\n\nA messy exit from Joe Root, hacking Seales to mid-on, lifted the West Indies but more mistakes were coming, Holder botching a regulation chance in the cordon to give Pope another stroke of luck and Athanaze parrying Harry Brook at gully.\n\nThe Yorkshireman was still impatient, scooping Kevin Sinclair to short-leg for 36 to tee up an acrobatic somersault celebration from the spinner. Pope made sure not to let his chance slip, maturing as the innings went on and picking off a steady supply of loose offerings.\n\nHe reached his ton in style, sweeping Sinclair for four then stepping back to pull Seales through midwicket. Pope, who had Arsenal and England goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale in the stands as his guest, looked in control by the time Alzarri Joseph finally took an edge that stuck but England had plenty in the tank.\n\nStokes pulled powerfully as he ended a run of low scores with a punchy half-century, while Jamie Smith smashed two sixes in a cameo of 36. Both men were caught trying to hammer poor deliveries from the slow bowlers, while Gus Atkinson was nicely caught at slip.\n\nMark Wood survived two near misses, Josh Da Silva missing a stumping and Mikyle Louis putting one down at point, but Holder clung on to Chris Woakes (37) and Shoaib Bashir to wrap up the innings by stumps.", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news",

The pacer had to be pulled out of the attack after only two overs that cost 28.\n\nJoseph (A) gave away 30 in an opening spell of five overs, and West Indies had no answer for the onslaught as the England total galloped to 50 from only 26 balls -- the fastest known in a Test.\n\nJason Holder brought a measure of control with his medium-fast bowling, but Duckett reached his 50 from only 32 balls - the third fastest by an English batter - when he steered the lanky paceman to third man for his 11th boundary.\n\nJoseph (S) ended the fun for Duckett, whose 59-ball knock included 14 fours, when the left-handed opener, on his home turf, was caught at second slip during a period in which the Windies managed to stem the free flow of runs.\n\nSeales almost struck another important blow for the visitors in the final over before lunch when Pope, on 47, tried to cut a delivery too close him, but gully fielder Alick Athanaze spilled a sharp chance.\n\nTwo wickets between lunch and tea kept West Indies interested, but Pope tempered their optimism when he reached his milestone from 143 balls with his 15th four flicked through square leg off Seales, and he anchored England to 259 for four at tea.\n\nWest Indies had a chance to remove Pope, on 54, in the fifth over after lunch, but Holder put down a regulation take at second slip off Joseph (S). But it was not all bad news for the visitors during the session.\n\nSeales got Joe Root caught at mid-on for 14 from a miscued pull, and Sinclair got Brook caught at short leg from a top-edged paddle-scoop after the young England batter dominated a stand of 59 for the fourth wicket with Pope.\n\nAfter tea, Joseph (A) got Pope caught at slip in the fifth over, but Stokes, with whom he added 80 for the fifth wicket, carried on merrily to reach his 50 from 71 balls.\n\nIn an effort to improve the over rate and rest the pacers before the second new ball, West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite gave Hodge an extended spell, and the part-timer captured his first Test wicket when he got Stokes caught at deep midwicket after the England captain put on 61 for the sixth wicket with Smith.\n\nHodge added the scalp of Smith caught at long-on, and Sinclair got Gus Atkinson caught at slip for two before Brathwaite claimed the second new ball, and Seales and Joseph (A) brought a topsy-turvy day for West Indies to a close with the last two English wickets.", "source": {"uri": "trinidadexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Trinidad Express Newspapers"}, "authors": [],

Duckett hammered a 59-ball 71 after the Caribbeans put England in to bat. He shared a century-plus stand with Ollie Pope following Zak Crawley's early departure in the very first over. Notably, Duckett smashed the joint third-fastest Test fifty for England.\n\nWest Indies started well as Alzarri Joseph dismissed Crawley on the match's third ball. However, Duckett smashed Jayden Seales for four successive boundaries in the very next over. Duckett and Pope were on fire thereafter, with England reaching the 50-run mark in just 4.2 overs. They took England past 100, having added a 105-run stand for the second wicket.\n\nDuckett completed his half-century off 32 balls, the joint third-fastest for England in Test cricket along with Ian Botham (vs New Zealand, The Oval, 1986). Notably, Botham leads this list with a 28-ball fifty against India in Delhi in 1981. Jonny Bairstow hammered a fifty off 30 balls against New Zealand in the 2022 Headingley Test.\n\nShamar Joseph gave WI their second breakthrough in the form of Duckett. The England opener eventually fell for a 59-ball 71, a knock laced with as many as 14 fours. He struck at a staggering 120.34.\n\nDuckett also reached a couple of landmarks on Day 1 at Trent Bridge. With his 62nd run, the England opener completed 10,000 runs in First-Class cricket. He also completed 1,500 Test runs during the course of his knock.

England kept the tempo up throughout the day like they have been doing under Ben Stokes in recent times and eventually, they finished with 416 on the board by stumps.\n\nThey did get off to a false start as Zak Crawley got squared up very early in the day, getting dismissed for a three-ball duck. But that didn't deter Duckett from launching into the West Indies attack as he smashed his first four balls for boundaries. Duckett hit a thrilling 32-ball fifty and in the process, helping England break the record for the fastest team fifty in Tests as well.\n\nPope, who took a backseat initially, got going as well with an array of strokes before Duckett at the other end edged Shamar Joseph behind to the slip cordon for a 59-ball 71. West Indies did get their hopes up in the post-lunch session when they managed to get rid of Joe Root cheaply but Harry Brook came out all guns blazing to quickly turn things around again. Brook raced to 24 off a mere 12 deliveries at one stage but one shot too many led to his downfall.\n\nPope, who had received a couple of reprieves by this time, regained his composure once again and took on the mantle of being the aggressor in the second session that led to a three-figure score. Stokes, who was batting on 2 off 19 at one stage, eventually got into the groove as his partnerships with Pope initially and then Jamie Smith later, gave England total control.\n\nAt one stage, England were cruising at 342/4 with Stokes looking good for a century. However, against the run of play, the skipper mistimed a half-tracker and failed to get enough connection to get caught at the boundary. To West Indies' credit, they did seize on that opportunity to pick up the remaining wickets at regular intervals before the close of play. For a side that didn't even post 150 in the first Test, 416 will indeed be a tall order when they commence their innings on the second day.\n\nBrief scores: England 416 (Ollie Pope 121, Ben Duckett 71; Alzarri Joseph 3/98) vs West Indies", "source": {"uri": "cricbuzz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cricbuzz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Duckett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ben Duckett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stokes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ben Stokes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Pope", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Crawley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zak Crawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Indies"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Bridge", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Bridge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Century (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duck (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Brook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Brook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Root", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Root"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzarri_Joseph", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alzarri Joseph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.cricbuzz.comhttps://static.cricbuzz.com/a/img/v1/600x400/i1/c521041/pope-made-121-in-the-first-inn.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743607", "eventUri": "eng-9743607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Duckett, whose participation in the match had been in doubt due to the imminent arrival of his first child, batted like a man in a hurry as he set a rollicking pace in the morning session.\n\nDriving and cutting with utter conviction, the left-hander propelled his side to 50 quicker than any other in Test history, just 26 balls, and reached his own half-century in only 32. Only Sir Ian Botham and Jonny Bairstow have ever done it faster in Tests for England.\n\nDuckett launched his foray in the second over, hijacking 19 off Jayden Seales. The seamer started with a wide and then saw each of his next four balls drilled to the ropes.\n\nTreating the situation like a T20 powerplay on his home ground, Duckett threw his hands at anything wide or overpitched as his ambitious strokeplay piled on the pressure. More than once, he was assisted by sloppy fielding.\n\nThe arrival of Holder briefly settled the scoring rate, and almost teased a return catch from Pope on 16, but Duckett was soon back on top as he sprayed the all-rounder either side of point.\n\nDuckett's hopes of converting his rapid half-century into three figures before lunch were ended by Shamar Joseph, who lined him up from round the wicket and had him well caught at second slip.\n\nHad Athanaze held on to Pope in the last over before lunch, it might have changed things, but the chance tumbled to the turf and allowed England to rest easy on 134 for two.\n\nA messy exit from Joe Root, hacking Seales to mid-on, restored balance but the West Indies needed to stay error-free. Instead they fell to pieces in the field, Holder botching a regulation chance in the cordon to give Pope another lifeline and Athanaze parrying another in the gully to spare Brook.\n\nThe Yorkshireman was impatient, scooping Kevin Sinclair to short-leg for 36 to tee up a somersault celebration from the spinner, but Pope showed real focus. Maturing into his innings as it moved along, he waited for the four balls and made sure not to waste them.\n\nHe moved to 98 with a sweep off Sinclair, a late call-up for the ill Gudakesh Motie, and secured his ton with a swivel pull through midwicket.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rory_dollard@aol.co.uk", "name": "Rory Dollard",

Ben Duckett scored 71, captain Ben Stokes added 69, Chris Woakes chipped in with 37, and both Harry Brook and Jamie Smith contributed 36 runs each.\n\nAlzarri Joseph and Jayden Seales were pivotal for the West Indies, sharing five wickets between them, but their inconsistent bowling initially undermined the visitors' efforts. Joseph ended the day with figures of 3 for 98 from 15.3 overs, while Seales took 2 for 90 from 15 overs. Their erratic spells allowed England to amass their highest first-day total on home soil since World War II.\n\nThe day began on a high note for the West Indies when Joseph dismissed Zak Crawley for a duck with the third ball of the match. However, the celebration was short-lived as Seales conceded 19 runs in his first over, forcing him out of the attack early. England capitalized on this shaky start, reaching 134 for two at lunch.\n\nDuckett, who reached his 50 from only 32 balls, was eventually dismissed by Shamar Joseph after a flurry of boundaries. Despite this, Pope continued to anchor the innings, reaching his century from 143 balls with his 15th four. He survived a dropped catch by Alick Athanaze on 47 and another missed opportunity by Jason Holder at second slip.\n\nThe West Indies managed to stem the flow of runs between lunch and tea, with Seales dismissing Joe Root for 14 and Sinclair getting Brook out for 36. After tea, Joseph removed Pope, but Stokes continued to build England's total, reaching his 50 from 71 balls.\n\nPart-time spinner Kavem Hodge took two crucial wickets, including Stokes, to curtail England's momentum. Sinclair and captain Kraigg Brathwaite utilized the second new ball effectively, taking the final two wickets and wrapping up England's innings.\n\nThe West Indies, trailing 1-0 in the three-match series after a heavy defeat in the first Test at Lord's, will look to build on their late-day resurgence as they prepare to bat.

Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope brought up the fifty for England in just 4.2 overs against West Indies. England's aggressive style of Test cricket under the coaching of Brendan McCullum is often referred to as 'Bazball,' a nod to McCullum's nickname 'Baz'.\n\nWest Indies won the toss and sent England in to bat first. Despite losing the opener Zak Crawley on the very third ball of the match as the batter lost his wicket to Alzarri Joseph, the new batter Ollie Pope and the other opener Ben Duckett took the attack to the Caribbean bowlers and never let them settle.

Duckett, whose participation in the match had been in doubt due to the imminent arrival of his first child, batted like a man in a hurry as he set a rollicking pace in the morning session.\n\nDriving and cutting with utter conviction, the left-hander propelled his side to 50 quicker than any other in Test history, just 26 balls, and reached his own half-century in only 32.

The seamer started with a wide and then saw each of his next four balls drilled to the ropes.\n\nTreating the situation like a T20 powerplay on his home ground, Duckett threw his hands at anything wide or overpitched as his ambitious strokeplay piled on the pressure. More than once, he was assisted by sloppy fielding.\n\nThe arrival of Holder briefly settled the scoring rate, and almost teased a return catch from Pope on 16, but Duckett was soon back on top as he sprayed the all-rounder either side of point.\n\nDuckett's hopes of converting his rapid half-century into three figures before lunch were ended by Shamar Joseph, who lined him up from round the wicket and had him well caught at second slip.\n\nHad Athanaze held on to Pope in the last over before lunch, it might have changed things, but the chance tumbled to the turf and allowed England to rest easy on 134 for two.\n\nA messy exit from Joe Root, hacking Seales to mid-on, restored balance but the West Indies needed to stay error-free. Instead they fell to pieces in the field, Holder botching a regulation chance in the cordon to give Pope another lifeline and Athanaze parrying another in the gully to spare Brook.\n\nThe Yorkshireman was impatient, scooping Kevin Sinclair to short-leg for 36 to tee up a somersault celebration from the spinner, but Pope showed real focus. Maturing into his innings as it moved along, he waited for the four balls and made sure not to waste them.\n\nHe moved to 98 with a sweep off Sinclair, a late call-up for the ill Gudakesh Motie, and secured his ton with a swivel pull through midwicket.", "source": {"uri": "cricket365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cricket365.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Duckett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ben Duckett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Pope", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lord's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Brook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Brook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Indies"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Bridge", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Bridge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraigg_Brathwaite", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kraigg Brathwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Holder", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Holder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Result_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Result (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alick_Athanaze", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alick Athanaze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Seales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Seales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzarri_Joseph", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alzarri Joseph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Botham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ian Botham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Bairstow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonny Bairstow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudakesh_Motie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gudakesh Motie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Root", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Root"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2gjl3w70qc898.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F07%2F18161524%2F2.76881378.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743607", "eventUri": "eng-9743607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

As well as Pope's twin reprieve, there were two more drops and a missed stumping as they failed to back their bowlers.\n\nVisiting captain Kraigg Brathwaite sprung a surprise at the toss when he sent England in to bat, a gamble that quickly came good when Alzarri Joseph snagged Zak Crawley's outside edge with the third ball of the match.\n\nEngland, though, were unfazed and Duckett set a rollicking pace in the morning session.\n\nThe left-hander propelled his side to 50 quicker than any other in test history, in just 26 balls, and reached his own half-century in 32.

Pope, however, matured as the innings went on and picked off a steady supply of loose offerings.\n\nHe reached his ton in style, sweeping Sinclair for four then stepping back to pull Seales through midwicket. Pope looked in control by the time Alzarri Joseph finally took an edge that stuck but England had plenty in the tank.\n\nStokes pulled powerfully as he ended a run of low scores with a punchy half-century, while Jamie Smith smashed two sixes in a cameo of 36. Both were caught trying to hammer poor deliveries from the slow bowlers, while Gus Atkinson was nicely caught at slip.\n\nMark Wood survived two near misses but Holder clung on to Chris Woakes (37)

Duckett, whose participation in the match had been in doubt due to the imminent arrival of his first child, batted like a man in a hurry as he set a rollicking pace in the morning session.\n\nDriving and cutting with utter conviction, the left-hander propelled his side to 50 quicker than any other in Test history, just 26 balls, and reached his own half-century in only 32. Only Sir Ian Botham and Jonny Bairstow have ever done it faster in Tests for England.\n\nDuckett launched his foray in the second over, hijacking 19 off Jayden Seales. The seamer started with a wide and then saw each of his next four balls drilled to the ropes.\n\nThe arrival of Holder briefly settled the scoring rate, and almost teased a return catch from Pope on 16, but Duckett was soon back on top as he sprayed the all-rounder either side of point.\n\nDuckett's hopes of converting his rapid half-century into three figures before lunch were ended by Shamar Joseph, who lined him up from round the wicket and had him well caught at second slip.\n\nHad Athanaze held on to Pope in the last over before lunch, it might have changed things, but the chance tumbled to the turf and allowed England to rest easy on 134 for two.\n\nA messy exit from Joe Root, hacking Seales to mid-on, restored balance but the West Indies needed to stay error-free. Instead they fell to pieces in the field, Holder botching a regulation chance in the cordon to give Pope another lifeline and Athanaze parrying another in the gully to spare Brook.\n\nHe moved to 98 with a sweep off Sinclair, a late call-up for the ill Gudakesh Motie, and secured his ton with a swivel pull through midwicket.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Duckett", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ben Duckett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Pope", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lord's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Brook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Brook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Indies"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Bridge", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Bridge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Holder", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Holder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Result_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Result (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzarri_Joseph", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alzarri Joseph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Botham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ian Botham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraigg_Brathwaite", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kraigg Brathwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Bairstow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonny Bairstow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudakesh_Motie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gudakesh Motie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Root", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Root"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://d3gvyx4eg3tne0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Img38602420.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743607", "eventUri": "eng-9743607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

After the West Indies won the toss and opted to bowl first, England produced a scintillating batting display, headlined by Ollie Pope, Ben Duckett, and Ben Stokes.\n\nAlzarri Joseph gave the tourists the ideal start as he dismissed Zak Crawley off the third ball of the match. However, Duckett and Pope joined forces and helped England break their own record for the fastest team 50 in Test cricket, reaching the landmark in just 26 balls. The southpaw was the more aggressive batter in a 105-run partnership, which came off just 112 balls.\n\nDuckett notched up his half-century off just 32 balls, fastest for an England opener in the Test arena. He got out for a 59-ball 71 after belting 14 boundaries. Pope, however, went on displaying his wide range of strokes and brought up his century in the second session. Alzarri ended his fluent knock of 121 off 167 deliveries after he had hit 15 fours and a solitary six.\n\nRoot was dismissed cheaply but Harry Brook played a breezy 36-run knock off 34 balls. Stokes contributed nicely as he slammed a 104-ball 69 before being dismissed by Kavem Hodge. Jamie Smith and Chris Woakes got starts but departed for 36 (54) and 37 (48), respectively.\n\nAfter reaching a commanding 281/4, it seemed that England would not be dismissed below the 400-run mark, however it did seem so when they slipped to 370/8. However, Woakes' contribution helped them get to 416 before being bowled out in the penultimate over of the day.\n\nThe West Indies wouldn't be too unhappy with themselves because they managed to pick wickets throughout the day but they conceded a few too many runs for their liking. Kraigg Brathwaite will rue the chances that his side put down during the day as England could have been dismissed much earlier. However, the visitors will need to put the disappointing fielding effort behind them and look to put on a solid batting show on Day 2.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Duckett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ben Duckett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Indies"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Pope", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Crawley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zak Crawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzarri_Joseph", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alzarri Joseph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Bridge", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Bridge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stokes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Stokes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Brook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Brook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Woakes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Woakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Smith_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Smith (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraigg_Brathwaite", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kraigg Brathwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.crictracker.com/media/attachments/1721316430557_Ollie-Pope-and-Ben-Stokes.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743607", "eventUri": "eng-9743607", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 126, "textEnd": 133}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Alzarri Joseph opened the bowling for the visitors, and got them off to the perfect start as Zak Crawley nicked the third ball to Alick Athanaze at third slip, leaving England 0-1.\n\nNo.3 Ollie Pope hit the first runs of the match, driving Joseph down the ground for four off the final delivery of the first over. The second over saw England start to motor, as Jayden Seales came into the attack and opener Ben Duckett faced up to him.\n\nAfter a wide off the first ball, Seales watched as Duckett reeled off four consecutive fours and a double, taking the total in the over to 19 runs. Twelve more followed in the third over as Pope got two more boundaries away off Alzarri Joseph.\n\nAnother nine runs came off the fourth over, leaving England 44-1.

On that occasion, openers Graham Gooch and Michael Atherton raced to the mark to give England a platform to chase down 204 for victory against South Africa at the Oval. Graeme Hick and Graham Thorpe, who came in later, also scored briskly and helped complete an eight-wicket win in just 35.3 overs.\n\nEngland now hold the record for the three fastest team fifties in men's Test cricket (where data is available).

There were times when it was a struggle and he wafted at wide balls in what was a fairly chequered hundred. But there were also some sumptuous shots in his 121, the sixth century of his Test career brought up with his 14th four. As always with Pope, it is what comes next that is important. Can he string together a run of big scores or will this be another oasis in the desert?\n\nTo make 416 all out after being asked to bat first, at 4.7 an over as well, added up to a decent, not outstanding total. England lost six wickets in the final session and against one of the top teams it would have felt an opportunity missed to control the game. But this feels like an awful lot of runs for a West Indies side bowled out cheaply twice a week ago and is so inexperienced.\n\nUnlocking consistency is Pope's challenge this summer against weaker opposition so he has numbers and a body of work to fall back on when England play 10 Tests in 2025-26 against India and Australia. In 18 Tests against the two best teams in the world he averages 22, a mark inflated by his 196 in Hyderabad. Yet that remarkable innings ushered in not a period of dominance but another series that ended with his place the subject of scrutiny. At the moment he is a slayer of average teams, or player of great shots, but can be so much better than that.\n\nHe is vice-captain, which is not a sop because he is increasingly involved in decision making. He is approaching 50 Tests at the age of 26 and his five hundreds at no 3 is the most for England since Jonathan Trott. It is now time to play like a senior leader in the team and making a hundred when not playing particularly well is a great start. If his touch improves after this could be Pope's summer, the kind he has threatened but never produced.\n\nPope is capable of playing a wonderful stroke one ball, and a hack at the next without reason or pressure from the bowlers. One former England Test player yesterday likened him to someone who is constantly being tickled by a feather duster because he is always likely to move in unpredictable ways. But this was an innings of substance over style and he was a lot less jumpy at the start, the freneticism dialled down as he happily allowed Ben Duckett to attack.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC he said captaining Surrey recently in the Blast had convinced him of his status as a senior pro and talked of feeling more comfortable in his own skin. This innings came at just the right time.\n\nWest Indies bowled some superb deliveries at times but were mostly erratic, shelled four catches, with two off Pope, missed a stumping and were minus two of their bowlers. Shamar Joseph pulled up with a hamstring injury in his 12th over and left-arm spinner Gudakesh Motie, their best player at Lord's, went down with flu before the toss.\n\nInviting England to bat first on a beautifully sunny day at Trent Bridge was a dangerous move and once West Indies squandered an early strike with the new ball by feeding England a succession of four balls, this Test quickly took shape as another procession.\n\nThe morning started with homage paid to one of Trent Bridge's own with Stuart Broad unveiling the plaque that marks the renaming of the Pavilion End in his honour. He would have enjoyed the ball from Alzarri Joseph that took Zak Crawley's edge in the first over but then shook his head at what followed next.\n\nIt was as if West Indies had never seen Duckett bat before, feeding him width as he whacked four fours in a row in the second over and propelled England to the fastest team fifty in Test cricket - off only 26 balls.\n\nDuckett briefly entered Gilbert territory - breaking the fastest Test hundred record held since 1902 by Gilbert Jessop - but ran out of puff as West Indies tightened up in the second hour, falling for 71 off 59 balls when he was well held at second slip by Jason Holder breaking a 105 run stand at nearly a run a ball.\n\nPope was dropped on 46 just before lunch by Alick Athanaze at gully, as West Indies tightened up in the second hour. It was a straightforward chance and it would arguably have been their morning at 134 for three had it been taken.\n\nPope was gifted another life soon after on 54 by Holder who messed up an edge that was far easier than the one he caught off Duckett. With Joe Root and Harry Brook both out to strange shots - Root changing his mind when playing a cut and Brook toe-ending a sweep because he lost his patience again - it was threatening to become West Indies' day.\n\nJoseph had bowled better than at Lord's and was West Indies most consistent seamer but his lack of conditioning sums up their Test game. Back to back Tests calls for stamina and fitness but Shamar has barely bowled since his heroics in Brisbane six months ago.\n\nMotie was replaced by Kevin Sinclair, an off spinning all-rounder, and he bowled well despite not really turning the ball. He celebrated Brook's wicket with a somersault and back flip.\n\nBen Stokes found a better balance between attack and defence in making his first fifty since Hyderabad but was caught on the legside fence off part-timer Kevam Hodge who had never taken a Test wicket before. It summed up a bitty England day.\n\nIn the spurious concept of 'winning sessions', West Indies win their first of the series by bagging six wickets since tea. After putting England in on winning the toss, bowling them out in 89 overs is a pretty good return, though England rarely bat for three complete sessions even when making a big total.\n\nA sense of disappointment in that score? Yes, in that they lack the ruthlessness they are going to need in the future. No, in that they have still taken on West Indies' strongest suit and made 400+.\n\nBut those four dropped catches hide what could have been another story altogether.\n\nBashir c Holder b Alzarri Joseph 5 Holder swoops low again at second slip when Joseph finds the No 11's edge. And he looks like a proper No11. FOW 416 all out.\n\nSeales starts with a loosener and Woakes whips it off his pads for four. Next ball, though, is on the money and nabs the England all-rounder. Enter England's new No 11, Shoaib Bashir, who gloves down the legside, short of the keeper, then chops a pull off the bottom edge for a single.\n\nWood takes Bashir's arrival as an invitation to tee off and whooshes a drive at fresh air to a full one. So Seales gives him a vicious bouncer that Wood evades via the splice in front of the nose. What's 'You guys are history' in Geordie?\n\nOne over to come.\n\nWoakes c Holder b Seales 37 Angles into him, holds its line and Woakes, hanging back, nicks off to second slip. Holder dives low to his left to take it. FOW 408/9\n\nWoakes brings up the 400 by climbing aboard his pogo stick to tuck a bouncer off his ribs for four. The next ball is short, too but wider, and Woakes clubs it for two through cover. A single to farm the strike gives Woakes the chance of facing Seales by poking through cover.\n\nWoakes works Hodge for a two and a brace of singles while Wood gets out the driver for a single to long on.\n\nTime for the new ball for the final overs of the day.\n\nWoakes torments Hodler at mid-off with an off drive that forces him to stretch his aching limbs in a futile chase as the ball arrows down for four.\n\nDeft by Woakes to scoop two over his shoulder then to drive a single. Wood sweeps hard for two but doesn't middle it and also drives for a single . Impressive contribution from these two spinning batsmen.\n\nNot exactly declaration batting by England off the spinners. A single each bookends Sinclair's over.\n\nMark Wood is trying to rein in his instincts and doesn't attempt a big shot but takes three with a very nice dab down through third. He is batting too low!\n\nEngland are given another life - Mikyle Louis drops Wood diving at point. It was low but should have been taken. A fourth dropped catch of the innings. Poor Sinclair.\n\nMark Wood, who made decent contributions in the last two Ashes with the bat coming in at eight or nine, has been demoted to No 10. I would feel insulted if I were him.\n\nIt's unlikely that England have blown this but it is very shoddy indeed from where they were at lunch and tea. As Nick wrote at tea. A decent side would punish them.\n\nDa Silva misses a stumping when Wood walks down for a swipe and misses.\n\nEngland have made 400 in their first innings in 25 Tests since Stokes became full time captain in 2022 only six times and they may fall short again today. Atkinson gets off the mark with a flick round the corner.\n\nSmith c Holder b Hodge 36 Another cheap dismissal. Smith had clobbered the previous delivery straight back over Hodge's head for six and then has another go. It was certainly there to hit, a bit wider perhaps so he had to fetch it, didn't middle it and carted it to wide long on where Holder had to run in and take it on the slide. FOW 367/7\n\nSinclair returns to make it spin at both ends and England take him for three singles.\n\nJust the single off Hodge as West Indies try to hug the wall unobtrusively as they approach the new ball.\n\nWoakes opens the face to run a single off Hodler down to the point boundary-rider. Smith is lured across his crease to try to flick a fuller ball fine that was angled across him but it nips back in to hit his right shin. Would have missed leg stump but there was always the danger of it spinning back on to the stumps.\n\nSmith reads the outswinger and strokes it down through point for two then wraps up the over by smearing a half-volley through extra for four.\n\nA little more caution shown towards Hodge now, Woakes pushing two singles in the arc through cover and point and Smith easing a drive down to the cover sweeper.\n\nArsenal and England No2 goalie Aaron Ramsdale is in the Sky box now, here to watch his good friend Ollie Pope. He's a cricket nut who had the chance as a kid to play for Staffs before football intervened.\n\nWoakes keeps out Holder's yorker then flicks a single through midwicket.\n\nNasser, once a Leeds fan, now tries to touch Ramsdale up for Arsenal tickets. He won't be there next season, as well you should know, Nass.\n\nTo be fair to Stokes, any batsman or batter worth their salt would have climbed into that long hop. It was slightly outside off stump but he just didn't middle it.\n\nStokes walks off shaking his head, his helmet clamped on. In a slight funk.\n\nStokes c sub (J Louis) b Hodge 69 Oh dear. He hangs his head after holing out to cow corner. The pull off a long-hop loops straight down the substitute fielder's throat. Jeremiah Louis takes a stride in from the rope and takes it, helping Hodge to his maiden Test wicket. FOW 342/6\n\nShamar Jospeh is back on the field. Mercifully it was only cramp but that speaks off poor prep given it's the second time in two Tests that he has been forced off.\n\nHolder continues. Stokes glides a single off the back foot down to third man and gives Smith the strike.\n\nHodge is given some punishment in the last over before drinks, Smith pivoting to muller his long hop for six after Stokes had chopped a two and a single into the offside.\n\nThere are 75 minutes left. I think the charge is coming.\n\nHolder has been causing Stokes problems with balls ramping off a good length from round the wicket but when he drops short, it sits up invitingly. So Stokes RSVPs and collars it on the pull for four. Holder goes back to a good length and Stokes runs it down to third man for two and then whips the attempted yorker fine for a single.\n\nA change of spinner - the left-armer Hodge replacing the offie Sinclair. Nice start, particularly round the wicket to the right-handed Smith as he loops the ball above his eyeline. Stokes takes two singles and Smith one.\n\nStokes tries to break the manacles by charging Holder and going for a slog to cow corner but it takes the leading edge and loops wide of long off. They run two. Staying at home, now, he check drives a single to mid-off. Smith sees out the over. Slightly becalmed but it should not be a problem if they can remain patient. Sometimes opponents only have to wait, to bore them out.\n\nConsolidation from England who play out four dot balls of Sinclair's 17th over and work a single each into the legside.\n\nJason Holder has found a spot from round the wicket that trampolines the ball up to the left-handed Stokes, beating him for lift on the outside edge and then forcing him to loosen his grip and steer another lifter down in front of gully. Stokes gets away from strike by dropping another rising ball at his toes and is called through for a burgled single by the swift-footed Smith.\n\nStokes slaps a single off the offie through cover and there's a no-ball to add to the score. At the end of the over there's some confusion about whether there were only five legit balls or the full six. Sky's Mark Butcher and Ian Ward say their scorer counted only five but the third umpire confirms it was six.\n\nHave lost count of the times umpires when playing or watching my son in club cricket routinely ask the scorer, 'One to come?'\n\nFifty for Stokes, brought up off 71 balls and by eassing a fullish ball from Seales through point for a single. More a defensive prod than a check-drive. Smith had given him the strike with an elegant drive to the cover sweeper for three as Seales errs too full once more.\n\nIt's Stokes' sixth half-century as captain to go with his centuries at Old Trafford against South Africa and versus Australia at Lord's.\n\nStokes hangs back to drill a single off Sinclair through cover and Smith works another off his pads. Stokes keeps talking to himself at the non-striker's. He is in constant dialogue.\n\nSeales diddles Stokes with one that spits up like a cobra from outside off from round the wicket. Well, the pitch diddles him. He was trying to drive it off the back foot and ended up splicing it over the slips for four. Plundering a two and a single into the offside, he gives Smith the strike and the keeper-batsman plays that pull in front of square he delighted Lord's with to hammer his first four.\n\nStokes is surprised by one that shapes away to the left-hander but nips back in and strikes him on the front thigh before cannoning into his left elbow. There's a gasp and a rub of the funny bone for a blow that would have weakened many a batsman's knees. As night follows day, Joseph follows striking the England captain with a short ball that he pulls hard for a single. Smith does a Pope and has a flashing drive at a wide one and squirts it past point for two. Alzarri gives Seales, the fielder who should have stopped it, a beseeching glare.\n\nSinclair's long hop on leg and middle is given the treatment by Stokes, whacking it fine for four and then the captain fiddles another single off his pads.\n\nStreaky century from Pope ends with the third chance he offered to slip but the drops don't go into the scorebook and all people 10 years hence will see is his 121, the 15 fours and a six.\n\nSmith gets off the mark after his fine debut last week with a whisk through the onside for a single. Alzarri Joseph tests Stokes again with the short ball and the England captain pans a pull through midwicket for four. He middled that with murderous power.\n\nPope c Hodge b A Joseph 121 Went hard at a drive and nicked off to wide first slip. It flew at Hodge at head-height to his left and he took a good catch. One of those whose trajectory looks regulation until you also take the speed into account. Pope didn't move his feet, just threw his hands at it. FOW 281/5\n\nNo trumpeter today so a chap in the crowd improvises the Great Escape theme with a rolled-up programme. Just the pair of singles off Sinclair.\n\nStokes defends a couple from Alzarri Joseph and then is disappointed to find point with a crashing drive off a no-ball. So much so that he throws caution to the wind and his bat at a lifting ball outside off, slicing it jammily over gully for four. Joseph tries him out on a flaccid-looking bouncer and he takes on the pull but is nowhere near it. It's ugly batting but he is still there having made 0,2,0,2 and 4 in his previous five Test innings\n\nChange of ends for Kevin Sinclair, too. Nice shot from Pope, leaning on to the front foot and stroking a straightish ball through cover for four.\n\nAlzarri Joseph resumes from the Radcliffe Road End, coming down the hill for the first time in the match. His second ball is wide and overpitches and Stokes cracks a square drive for four.\n\nJoseph tries a different tack, bangs one in short and Stokes pulls it hard and flat and square for four. Pedal to the metal.\n\nAnother solid session for England. Ollie Pope's sixth Test hundred should settle him in nicely for the summer after a poor run and England can really accelerate in the evening session.\n\nWest Indies have bowled inconsistently, shelled three catches and shipped runs through misfields. They ended the afternoon session losing Shamar Joseph as well, who limped off clutching his left hamstring. England can really cash in after tea against a depleted attack with Stokes, Pope and Jamie Smith to come.\n\nIt has not been Pope's finest innings and he was dropped twice, on 46 and 54, both catches that should have been taken, but at least he has stayed in this time. Substance over style for once from him.\n\nHarry Brook gave his wicket away, toe-ending a sweep after getting tied down for five overs, which is becoming a theme. Teams will now play on his patience, knowing he will offer up a chance.\n\nBowling is West Indies strong suit so 259-4 looks very ominous. Shamar was bowling well, with more control than at Lord's but his lack of conditioning reflects the fact West Indies just do not play enough cricket these days, this series being their first six seven months. A better team would have England in trouble today. West Indies are talented but green and another one-sided game is brewing.\n\nNot the fireworks of the first session, that Brook onslaught on the erratic Alzarri Joseph apart. Both Tykes, Root and Brook, rather gave away their wickets in a manner that would cause Ticker Mitchell to spin in his grave. \"Does tha not like battin', lad?'\n\nAnyway, England are in the ascendancy and will be hoping to build a score that enables them to win while batting only once.\n\nShamar pulls up lame after three balls. It's not the end of his Test, he came back from doing the same at Lord's to continue, but this one seems to be a groin issue. Any road, it delays tea by five minutes and Brathwaite finishes the over with three of his slow catapults, Pope and Stokes fiddling his darts through the offside for a single each.\n\nPope and Stokes miss two singles apiece off Sinclair, three through the offside, one, from Pope, with the turn to deep backwards square. This is the first half-century partnership for these two since that double hundred they put on at Port Elizabeth/Gqebehra in early 2020, just before Covid struck. This is the 15th time they have batted together since.\n\nSeales digs one in to Stokes who picks it up early but is a bit cramped on his pull so top-edges it to long leg for two. Sayles berates Louis for his fielding, believing it should only have rendered a single. Seales pitches the next one up and Stokes whisks it through midwicket for two more then ends the over en pointe, slapping a single through mid-on.\n\nNo one would want to jinx Stokes but there are healthy signs in his gear-shift here.\n\nSinclair bowled very well this morning and at the start of this spell but his line in the past couple of overs to the right-hander has been a little too wide of off stump and he continues in that vein to Pope, giving him the opportunity, risk-free, to smack two twos between point and cover and arrive at 111, his own, personal, Nelson. Reach out, touch faith.\n\nFirst boundary for Stokes off the returning Seales who gives him an opportunity to free his arms and he drives square off the back foot, beating the point sweeper.\n\nStokes, who averages 24 in his past nine Tests after his brilliant hundred at Lord's last summer, taps a single down the ground off Sinclair after Pope had pushed two through cover and drilled a single to point.\n\nA groan from the crowd when Pope flicks at one angled across him and the four is signalled as leg-byes. But the next ball from Holder is short but doesn't get up. Pope pulls it nonetheless and skelps it for four.\n\nPope since June 2022 under Stokes' captaincy and at No 3: 1,579 runs in 22 Tests at 42.67 with five hundreds.\n\nStokes under Joe Root: 1,032 runs in 23 Tests at 28.66 with one century.\n\nPope moves to the verge of a sixth Test century with two twos and a four, reverse sweeping and driving Sinclair for a pair of deuces, sweeping him for four fine and then tapping a half-volley through mid-on for a single to reach 99.\n\nToo many gimme balls from Holder, giving Pope a half-volley to cream between mid-off and extra-cover for four. The nxt ball floats tamely towards middle and Pope whips it through midwicket for three.\n\nPope takes a single off Sinclair's first ball, spearing the arm ball through cover. Stokes plays out the rest of the over with a full face, looking for gaps but finding none.\n\nJust when West Indies try to turn the screw, Holder giftwraps a pie on Pope's legs and he moves into the eighties with a flick fine for four.\n\nKevin Sinclair's second Test wicket in his second Test is celebrated like the first with a cartwheel and somersault. He has bowled really well having come in as a late replacement for the injured Motie. An ugly shot from Brook.\n\nEnter Ben Stokes to a loud ovation and he gets off the mark second ball by whisking one off the back foot through square leg.\n\nBrook c McKenzie b Sinclair 36 Tried to paddle the off-spinner off off and middle, caught the ball with the toe and spooned it towards silly mid-on. Short leg covered the ground to complete the catch. Sinclair completes a joyous cartwheel with a back somersault. Lovely! FOW 201/4\n\nHolder is a 78mph bowler these days in his later spells and is not going to be able, despite his height, to test Brook's iffiness under a barrage. He pitches it up, leaks a single when he loses his line but is otherwise tight.\n\nBack comes Kevin Sinclair and with this abysmal over-rate he'll have to bowl a long spell to get them anywhere close to parity by 6.30pm.\n\nThe offie starts with a tight over, beginning with four dot balls until Pope uses his feet to smear a single down through mid-on and Brook farms the strike by spearing one out of the blockhole to the point sweeper. It also brings up England's 200 at five an over on the nail.\n\nNice video here of Joe Root presenting Chris Woakes with his 50th cap. I've been thinking that in recent weeks, people's emotions around Jimmy Anderson's enforced retirement have meant that Woakes has been rather talked down. Yes, he is 35, but he is more than six years younger than Anderson, and was player of the series in last year's Ashes. Then, he averaged under 20 and Anderson averaged more than 80. My personal take is that as England build towards the 25/26 series, they do have space for one veteran home specialist, and to me it makes sense to select the younger model with a better recent record who also is a No 8, not a No 11.\n\nTalking of probing, that's what Holder does these days. He pounds ball after ball down t'corridor, Brook lets two go, drives for two with the help of Louis' misfield and two more by virtue of two misfields, a fumble at cover by Louis followed by an overthrow. Who'd be a bowler?\n\nLouis makes amends with a fine diving stop at extra-cover, turning what should have been a four for a sweet drive into a dot ball. So he's 1 up on the over.\n\nTime for drinks.\n\nA maiden for Shamar to His Holiness, Pope playing it orthodox fashion, probing, finding fielders. Time for a change, Jason Holder will replace the wayward Alzarri for the ore-drinks over.\n\nBrook, becalmed for a couple of overs, wakes up with a roar. It's a perfectly respectable ball, probably fourth stump, tailing in and he jabs it over third man for six. No room to free his arms. No bother. Extraordinary stroke. England Cricket might post a clip. If they do I'll stick it on here.\n\nShamar returns to join his kinsman and racks up five dot balls until he strays on to Pope's pads and the vice-captain insouciantly glances it fine for four.\n\nAthanaze drops Brook but there is some mitigation. The ball flew at gully as Brook went for the back-foot drive, diddled by the inswing, and Athanaze, masochistically close in, was lucky to escape being a victim of dental disintegration as he threw his hands in front of his face to parry it away, hurting his finger in the process.\n\nStill, a maiden for Alzarri J having been tonked in his preceding over.\n\nPope has been his usual combination of sublime and streaky when making a decent score. Seales sighs (so tempting to write 'squeals' but it wouldn't be accurate) when Pope essays an expansive drive to the channel outswinger and Harrow drives/French cuts it for four to fine leg, the ball whistling past off stump. The next ball is a pie, short and wide and Pope lamps it over cover for four more.\n\nWest Indies seized the initiative and are spraying it all up the wall. The bowlers' pitch maps look like a snooker table after an earthquake.\n\nAlzarri replaces Shamar. The Josephs share a surname but, of course, as cricket aficionados know, it is hard to find more than a handful of West Indian Test cricketers who share the same Christian/first name. There are so many uniquely monikered legends.\n\nBrook tucks in, smiting three successive fours, off filth. The first is a cover drive, hit gloriously on the up, the second a flick off the toes, as deft and oily wristed as a classical Indian batsman and the third a brutally cleaved square cut.\n\nHis previous square cut in the over had gone down, rather than up, and bounced into the face of the diving Sinclair at backward point.\n\nThis replacement ball is behaving as West Indies might wish. Brook throws the bat at a Seales outswinger and nicks it over the head of gully for four. So Seales goes shorter and Brook slices it over the same fielder with more control and panache for four more.\n\nAustralia saw a conspiracy in a replacement ball last summer. How daft was that?\n\nPope's beans are jumping again and he flashes a drive at Shamar and nicks off to second slip where Jason Holder drops a routine chance, the ball bursting through his hands as he swayed to his left and first slip, Hodge, can't reach the rebound.\n\n\"Swing, Brookie!\" shouts Pope. I think he knows, Ollie.\n\nSeales bowled two unplayable deliveries in a terrific over, the first angling in to Root and nipping away to beat the outside edge and whistle past off stump and then, having discombobulated him, bags him with an innocuous back of a length delivery that Root horribly misjudges. And at the end of over he beats Pope with another ripper that angles in and snakes away.\n\nRoot c Alzarri Joseph b Seales 14 Cloths a pull high to mid-on and Joseph, who makes a hash of his first attempt, pouches the sitter with great relief at the second. The ball before had missed Root's off-stump by a whisker and he made the least of his 'life'. FOW 142/3\n\nHaving passed 50, Pope allows himself a woolly waft outside off at Shamar and then tries to show his contrition with a textbook forward defensive, straight out of Harry Altham's MCC manual that was still de rigueur in schools in the late 70s. Shamar Joseph drops short and Pope pulls off the bottom edge, collaring it for four then chisels out a fuller one with such force that he knocks the ball out of shape sufficiently, finally, to persuade the umpires to change it.\n\nSeales bowls a heavy ball at 84mph. Not express but you can sense it jars when Root defends a couple after Pope flicked the first, full one through square leg for a single.\n\nA lot of encouragement for Seales from one of his team-mates whose voice, but not what it is saying, can be clearly heard above the hum of the Nottingham crowd. Root punches a single off the back foot through cover and Pope brings up his 50 when Seales attempts the yorker that drifts in, like a sandshoe crusher, but pitches three inches too soon and Pope jabs down his bat and takes a single off the inside-third of the toe behind square.\n\nShamar Joseph, who bowled well this morning, giving his captain some control by bowling a top of off line, starts the second session and straightway he has Pope on the front foot but not middling the ball as he tries a flick and two pushes to inswingers. A misfield by the captain, diving at midwicket, gives Root the strike and Shamar Joseph immediately switches from inswingers to 4th stump, Root leaving one and defending one, nose above the ball, elbow bent, holding the pose before smiling and skipping up the pitch for a wander.\n\nGood afternoon. Bagchi here, taking over from Smyth. Apropos Will's point below. England have made only six centuries in the past 11 Tests, Joe Root's at Edgbaston in the Ashes and at Ranchi bookending Ben Stokes at Lord's, Zak Crawley at Old Trafford, Ollie Pope at Hyderabad and Ben Duckett at Rajkot.\n\nEngland are set for the afternoon and a big score to control the second Test. West Indies decision to bowl first on a belting pitch backfired because of the waywardness of their bowlers and inability to cope with Ben Duckett's counter-attack on the ground where Bazball was born.\n\nZak Crawley's third-ball duck in the opening over appeared to justify Kraigg Brathwaite's defensive call at the toss but the bowlers could not keep up the pressure feeding Duckett width on both sides of the wicket as he set the ball rolling with four fours in a row and England raced to a new record for the fastest team fifty in history - off 26 balls.\n\nIt was rollicking stuff as Duckett hit 14 boundaries in his first Test on his home ground while Ollie Pope settled in a lot calmer than recent times providing good back up support. Duckett's fifty off 32 balls was the quickest by an England opener and suddenly Gilbert Jessop's name was banded around again as the fastest Test hundred became reality.\n\nDuckett slowed up when Shamar Joseph bowled a tighter line from the newly minted Stuart Broad End and spinner Kevin Sinclair was tidy too in a better second hour for West Indies. England had raced to 56 for one off the first six overs - almost as good as their best powerplay in the recent T20 World Cup - and were 86 for one in the first hour. It slowed with 48 added in the second hour. Duckett was caught well, low down at second slip by Jason Holder off Joseph and if Pope had been held at gully in the final over, it could arguably have been West Indies' session.\n\nPope is dropped on the stroke of lunch! He back cut Seales towards gully, where Athanaze put down a very sharp chance. That would have made it an even session; instead it belongs to England and especially Ben Duckett, whose riotous 59-ball 71 gave England an extraordinary start. West Indies pull it back pretty well in the second hour, but they have work to do.\n\nIncidentally, that boundary took Root above Sri Lanka's Mahela Jayawardene and up to ninth place on the list of leading Test runscorers. The next man in his sights in Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who is around 50 runs ahead.\n\nRoot has found his timing now. A wristy pull for four off Alzarri takes him into double figures. Even with a relatively quiet second hour, England are going at five an over.\n\nPope has happy memories of playing at Trent Bridge. Two years ago he made 145 against New Zealand on this ground, his first century in his new role at No3. Bar one or two strokes he has played carefully, with a bed and breakfast mindset.\n\nRoot gets his first boundary, clipping Seales through midwicket. Both teams will be happy enough as we approach lunch - England because of where they are, West Indies because of where they were. The first 12 overs disappeared for 86; the last 12 have cost only 40.\n\nAlzarri Joseph replaces Shamar and concedes three from a quiet over. Root hasn't yet found his timing and has 3 from 13 balls.\n\nJayden Seales, whose two overs with the new ball were pummelled for 28, retuns to the attack. Root is beaten by a full-length jaffa that moves very late, and Seales returns with a maiden. You don't see figures of 3-1-28-0 every day.\n\nBefore drinks England were scoring at 7.17 runs per over; in the first eight overs after the break they scored at 2.38.\n\nPope gives that figure a boost by hitting Shamar Joseph for 10 in two balls, an excellent pull followed by an extravagant pick up for six. England have punished the bad ball mercilessly.\n\nSinclair hasn't done much with the ball - it's the first morning - but he played his part in the wicket by helping Shamar Joseph to slow England down. Another quiet over gives him figures of 4-0-14-0.\n\nThat was the last ball of the over.\n\nDuckett c Holder b S Joseph 71 Shamar Joseph is rewarded for a fine spell. He moved around the wicket to Duckett, who clobbered him for four but then edged an outswinger to second slip. Holder got down smartly to his right to take a fine catch.\n\nDuckett goes for an exhilarating 71 from 59 balls. Now he can go and witness the birth of his child. FOW: 105/2\n\nDuckett hits the first boundary since drinks, sweeping Sinclair through square leg on the full. That brings up the hundred partnership as well as the England hundred; Zak Crawley's third-ball duck feels forever ago.\n\n\"It's all calmed down a little here,\" writes Will Macpherson at Trent Bridge, \"which is remarkable when you think that England are 101 for one after 18.\"\n\nPope tries to pull Shamar and is beaten. Apologies for the brevity, we're having one or two technical problems.\n\nJust eight runs in four overs since drinks, which is a victory of sorts for West Indies. The problem is they put England in, and when you do that you don't want your spinner to be drying up before lunch.\n\nStuart Broad, commentating on Sky, says Shamar Joseph's stride pattern and rhythm look much better than at Lord's. So does his economy rate: he has figures of 3-1-9-0 and almost takes his first wicket when Pope swishes at fresh air.\n\nAnd now for something completely different: the offspin of Kevin Sinclair, who came into the side this morning when Gudakesh Motie woke up feeling unwell. A quiet first over, two from it. Gilbert Jessop's record looks safe: Duckett has 61 from 46 balls now.\n\nThe early signs are good for Shamar Joseph, whose second over is an accurate maiden to Pope.\n\nDuckett clatters Holder through the covers for four more. An exasperated Holder tells the man to go back to the boundary and switches to around the wicket. The rest of the over passes without incident or boundary.\n\nThat's drinks. Surely, in the long history of Test cricket - all red-ball cricket - no team has put the opposition in and gone at more than seven an over in the first hour.\n\nShamar Joseph replaces Alzarri at the Stuart Broad End. He was very rusty at Lord's but is the kind of character who will relish this challenge. A fraction of width allows Pope to flash a back cut for four; it feels like Pope has started watchfully and he's 23 not out from 27.\n\nI think we can say, without fear of contradiction, that Kraigg Brathwaite probably made the wrong decision at the toss.\n\nDuckett steers Holder through point for four to reach a thrilling fifty from only 32 balls, including 11 no-frills boundaries. It's the fastest by an England opener and the third fastest overall:\n\nThe fastest England century, the Gilbert Jessop stat that has been imperilled in the last two years, is 76 balls.\n\nPope has been anything but frenetic this morning. He's happily building an innings in Duckett's shadow; in fact he's scored only 1 off this last 12 overs.\n\nA good over from Alzarri includes a sharp bouncer that beats Duckett's attempted hook. West Indies enquired for caught behind but the only thing is brushed was Duckett's helmet. Duckett is 48 not out from 31 balls.\n\nJason Holder won't be bowling any maidens to Ben Duckett. A full ball is smoked through extra cover for four, then another is rifled whence it came for Duckett's 10th boundary. He's faced 29 balls and this is officially bonkers.\n\nA Test match is starting to break out at Trent Bridge. Alzarri concedes only two from his seventh over, one of which was a no-ball.\n\nBen Duckett has 40 from 23 balls, Ollie Tavare has 16 from 17.\n\nA desperate Kraigg Brathwaite turns to Jason Holder, his most accurate bowler. He calms things down with a maiden to Pope, and almost takes a wicket when Pope checks a shot that loops just past Holder's outstretched hand.\n\nDuckett hits four more off Alzarri to bring up the England fifty in 4.2 overs - that's the fastest on record for any team, one delivery quicker than that Gooch/Atherton partnership I mentioned. \"The Bazballers of their day...\" deadpans Athers on commentary.\n\nThe orgy of boundaries continues with a businesslike pull from Duckett, who is 38 not out from 17 balls on the first morning of the Test. He's not the greatest opener of all time, not even in the top 100, but he is unique: he hardly ever leaves the ball and his strike rate of 87 is the highest of any opener who has made 200 Test runs. Even Virender Sehwag, the ultimate Bazballer, scored at 83 runs per 100 balls.\n\nThis is getting silly. Duckett times Seales sweetly to the point boundary to make it 39 from the last 14 balls.\n\nSeales restores a soup\u00e7on of order with three straight dot balls, including an underedge that bounces short of the keeper da Silva, but then Duckett guides another boundary to third man. This might be England's fastest start to an innings since Graham Gooch and Mike Atherton went mad at the Oval 30 years ago.\n\nDuckett has 27 from 12 balls, Pope 16 from 9.\n\nAlzarri Joseph beats Pope, who then cuffs a pull for two. Joseph is getting movement but has been slightly short, and England are scoring runs far too easily. Pope slashes a back cut for four, then clips through midwicket for another.\n\nEngland have scored 35 runs from the last 13 balls, on the first morning of a Test. What kind of sick world are we living in.\n\nBen Duckett is in a hurry at the best of times; today, with his partner due to give birth, he is unlikely to hang around. But I don't think any of us expected him to hit his first four legal deliveries for four! Stunning batting.\n\nSeales started with a wide, then was crashed twice to the cover boundary. When Seales adjusted his line, Duckett clipped through midwicket for another. Then when Seales went back too far the other way, Duckett lasered him through extra cover.\n\nOllie Pope gets England going with a fine drive to the left of mid-on for four.\n\nCrawley c Athanaze b Joseph So that's why they bowled first: Zak Crawley has gone third ball for nought! He'd already been hit on the arm by Alzarri Joseph when he was squared up by a length delivery and edged low to third slip, where Alick Athanaze swooped to take a fine two-handed catch. FOW: 0/1\n\nIt really does look like a batting day at Trent Bridge. The first hour should tell us whether Kraigg Brathwaite was right to bowl first.\n\nFresh from unveiling the new Stuart Broad End, Stuart Broad rings the bell just before the players line up for the anthems.\n\nOne change apiece, both enforced: Mark Wood for Jimmy Anderson, Kevin Sinclair for Gudakesh Motie.\n\nEngland Crawley, Duckett, Pope, Root, Brook, Stokes (c), Smith (wk), Woakes, Atkinson, Wood, Bashir.\n\nWest Indies Brathwaite (c), Louis, McKenzie, Athanaze, Hodge, Holder, da Sillva (wk), Sinclair, A Joseph, S Joseph, Seales.\n\nSo much for it being a batting day. Ben Stokes says he was bit undecided what to do, and he's not telling us anyway.\n\nI'm ready to go. I haven't had loads of overs off the back of the T20 World Cup but I feel fresh, I'm not coming off an injury or anything. Hopefully I can find catch up on those overs and find some rhythm. There's nothing like being on the field.\n\nIt's great to have Jimmy still in the dressing-room, passing on his knowledge, and we see Broady in the morning. But yeah, it's a bit of a shock to the system. I hope people aren't expecting me to bowl like Anderson - that's definitely not gonna happen!\n\n[On his increase in pace] Trevor Bayliss inspired me when he said I need a bit of mongrel, then I lengthened my run-up in 2019.\n\n[On his scintillating performance at Headingley when he came into the side last summer] I felt great - I felt 100 per cent on it. I think it's like being in the zone as a batter. Your legs feel weightless.\n\nThis is the first day of the rest of English cricket's life, their first Test since the retirement of James Anderson. If you want to feel really old, look at this team - the XI they picked for the last Test before Anderson's debut in 2003: Trescothick, Vaughan, Butcher, Hussain, Key, Crawley, Stewart (wk), Dawson, Caddick, Hoggard, Harmison. Our own Michael Vaughan slammed a majestic 183 as England beat Australia at Sydney.\n\nBen Duckett's partner is due to give birth, but he is at the ground and on course to start the game. The plan is that he will leave as and when required.\n\nHello and welcome to live coverage of the second Test between England and West Indies at Trent Bridge. Test cricket could do with some Robin Hood action: last week's mismatch at Lord's highlighted the increasingly dangerous gap between the haves and the have-nots, and we could really do with a proper contest this week.\n\nWest Indies should be better for the match practice, particularly the two Josephs, and their astonishing victory in Brisbane in January came after an equally demoralising defeat in the first Test.\n\nEngland's plan is to scorch them while they're down. Mark Wood will join Gus Atkinson, Chris Woakes and Ben Stokes in a mouthwatering seam attack. Then again, on the last two occasions England picked two proper quicks - at Southampton in 2020 and Edgbaston in 2021 - they were beaten by West Indies and New Zealand respectively.\n\nIt should be fun to watch, whatever happens. \"You ask any batter in the world, whether it be Joe Root, Steve Smith, Marnus Labuschagne, pace is a massive weapon that makes you do different things,\" said the England captain Ben Stokes. \"It makes you think differently. But also there has got to be skill attached to your pace.\n\n\"Gus showed that last week, that he's more than just an out-and-out quick bowler, he's incredibly skilful. As is Mark Wood. The ability for him to be able to bowl as quickly as he does but have the control and swing as well is something that's very rare in someone who bowls that fast.\n\n\"It's an added bonus having people who you can select who can bowl at 90mph and above, but you still have to be very skilful with what you've got.\"\n\nOr, as Michael Holding succinctly put it, pace is pace.\n\nEngland Crawley, Duckett, Pope, Root, Brook, Stokes (c), Smith (wk), Woakes, Atkinson, Wood, Bashir.\n\nWest Indies Brathwaite (c), Louis, McKenzie, Athanaze, Hodge, Holder, da Sillva (wk), Motie, A Joseph, S Joseph, Seales.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Pope", "type": "person",

After winning the toss, the visitors invited the hosts to bat first and the decision paid off as Zak Crawley was dismissed for a duck in the opening over by Alzarri Joseph.\n\nBut Ben Duckett stood firm at the other end showing his masterclass with bat as he scored a sensational half-century to set the base for the English side. Duckett accumulated 71 runs off just 59 deliveries which included 14 boundaries but fell shy of a century. After the first strike, Duckett unexpectedly launched a counter-attack on the Windies bowling and accumulated quick runs in the process.\n\nHowever, his innings was cut short in the 19th over by Shamar Joseph who put an end to his lethal powerplay. Duckett helped England race past 50 runs in just 4.2 overs, setting a new record for the fastest team fifty in Test history. In the 10th over, Duckett reached his half-century off just 32 balls, becoming the fourth fastest English batter to do so in Test cricket.\n\nHowever, Joseph, with the assistance of Holder's fielding brilliance, halted his innings in the 19th over with a full delivery just outside off, which Duckett attempted to drive through the line. The ball caught a thick outside edge of the bat and travelled to the slips where Holder took a remarkable catch.\n\nMeanwhile, after his dismissal, Ollie Pope took charge of the innings and continued from where Duckett had left. Joe Root too entered the club a a fine start but could not take his innings beyond a certain point succumbing for 14 runs.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sumit_channa@news9live.com", "name": "Sumit Channa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Duckett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ben Duckett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Crawley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zak Crawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzarri_Joseph", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alzarri Joseph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Bridge", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Bridge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Holder", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Holder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duck (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nottingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Pope", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Root", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Root"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Jason-Holder-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743607", "eventUri": "eng-9743607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Pope, who survived chances on 46 and 54, capitalized on these reprieves to notch up his sixth test hundred. His innings gathered pace after lunch, although he was let off again by Holder shortly after the break. Joe Root's aggressive intent was curtailed when he top-edged a pull shot off Jayden Seales to Alzarri Joseph.\n\nHarry Brook contributed a brisk 36, highlighted by a daring six over backward point, before falling to Kevin Sinclair's spin, caught by Kirk McKenzie at short leg. Sinclair marked the wicket with a celebratory backward somersault. Pope's confidence surged as he reached his century with a boundary through square leg, acknowledging the crowd with helmet off and bat raised. His innings eventually ended with an edge to Kavem Hodge off Alzarri Joseph.\n\nCaptain Ben Stokes found form with a fluent 69, striking eight fours before falling to part-time spinner Hodge. The wicket of Stokes would trigger a collapse as the West Indies bowlers would find the needed momentum to come back into the contest.\n\nLower-order contributions from Jamie Smith (36) and Chris Woakes (37) ensured England reached a formidable total, leaving them well-placed to capitalize on their strong start and potentially go 2-0 up in the series after their comprehensive win in the first test at Lord's.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Pope", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Duckett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Duckett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Crawley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zak Crawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzarri_Joseph", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alzarri Joseph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Bridge", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Bridge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stokes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Stokes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alick_Athanaze", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alick Athanaze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Seales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Seales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Brook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Brook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Holder", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Holder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Sinclair_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Sinclair (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lord's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavem_Hodge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kavem Hodge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Woakes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Woakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202407/eng-vs-wi-181418791-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=kow3YFQlJp8apORRM.OL_cG4VovjhB17", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743607", "eventUri": "eng-9743607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Dropped on 46 and 54, Pope compiled his sixth test century as the hosts built on Ben Duckett's sparkling 71 in the morning to establish a strong position. Put in to bat, England lost Zak Crawley to the third ball of the match, caught at slip by Alick Athanaze off Alzarri Joseph, but Duckett hit four boundaries in a row to get started and sped to his fifty off 32 balls. The left-hander looked well on course for his fourth test century until he pushed at a full ball from Shamar Joseph and nicked a low catch to Jason Holder at second slip. Pope, dropped by Athanaze at gully just before lunch, should also have been caught by Holder after the interval before Joe Root, on 14, top-edged an attempted pull off Jayden Seales and skied a catch to Alzarri Joseph. Harry Brook moved briskly to 36, including a six over backward point, before he edged a paddle sweep off spinner Kevin Sinclair to Kirk McKenzie at short leg and the bowler celebrated with a backward somersault. Pope grew in confidence, moving to his hundred with a crisp four through square leg before removing his helmet and raising his bat to the crowd. Pope edged a catch to Kavem Hodge off Alzarri Joseph but captain Ben Stokes made a welcome return to form with the bat, hitting eight fours in his 69 before being caught off part-time spinner Hodge. Jamie Smith (36) and Chris Woakes (37) chipped in down the order and England will feel confident of taking advantage of a positive start to move 2-0 up in the series following their innings victory in the first test at Lord's.", "source": {"uri": "thedailyherald.sx", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "editorial_dept@thedailyherald.sx", "name": "Editorial Dept.", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Pope", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Duckett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Duckett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Crawley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zak Crawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzarri_Joseph", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alzarri Joseph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Bridge", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Bridge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nottingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Seales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Seales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Holder", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Holder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Root", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Root"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Sinclair_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Sinclair (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lord's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavem_Hodge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kavem Hodge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Brook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Brook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stokes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Stokes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Result_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Result (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Woakes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Woakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Off spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.thedailyherald.sx/images/2024/07/18/CRICKET_large.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743607", "eventUri": "eng-9743607", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nottingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Opening the innings for his side on Day 1 of the second Test, Duckett lost his partner Zak Crawley early on who edged Alzarri Joseph to third slip.\n\nHowever, the early loss didn't bring any change in Duckett's plans who began his innings in quite a dramatic fashion by scoring four consecutive boundaries against Jayden Seales.

Courtesy of his fiery start, England registered the fastest team fifty in the history of Test cricket, reaching the landmark in just 4.2 overs.

As well as Pope's twin reprieve, there were two more drops and a missed stumping as they failed to back their bowlers.\n\nVisiting captain Kraigg Brathwaite sprung a surprise at the toss when he sent England in to bat, a gamble that quickly came good when Alzarri Joseph snagged Zak Crawley's outside edge with the third ball of the match.\n\nEngland, though, were unfazed and Duckett set a rollicking pace in the morning session.\n\nThe left-hander propelled his side to 50 quicker than any other in test history, in just 26 balls, and reached his own half-century in 32. Only Ian Botham and Jonny Bairstow have ever done it faster for England.\n\nHis hopes of converting his rapid half-century into three figures before lunch were ended by Shamar Joseph, who had him well caught at second slip.\n\nHad Athanaze held on to Pope in the last over before lunch, it might have changed things, but the chance tumbled to the turf and allowed England to rest easy on 134-2.\n\nJoe Root had a messy exit, hacking Jayden Seales to mid-on, and Harry Brook scooped Kevin Sinclair to short-leg for 36 to tee up an acrobatic somersault celebration from the spinner. Pope, however, matured as the innings went on and picked off a steady supply of loose offerings.\n\nHe reached his ton in style, sweeping Sinclair for four then stepping back to pull Seales through midwicket. Pope looked in control by the time Alzarri Joseph finally took an edge that stuck but England had plenty in the tank.\n\nStokes pulled powerfully as he ended a run of low scores with a punchy half-century, while Jamie Smith smashed two sixes in a cameo of 36. Both were caught trying to hammer poor deliveries from the slow bowlers, while Gus Atkinson was nicely caught at slip.\n\nMark Wood survived two near misses but Holder clung on to Chris Woakes and Shoaib Bashir to wrap up the innings by stumps.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Indies"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lord's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Duckett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Duckett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Bridge", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Bridge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Holder", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Holder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stumped", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stumped"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzarri_Joseph", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alzarri Joseph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stokes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Stokes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Botham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ian Botham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraigg_Brathwaite", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kraigg Brathwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Bairstow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonny Bairstow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_Atkinson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gus Atkinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Seales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Seales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Wood_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Wood (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Brook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Brook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Woakes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Woakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Root", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Root"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/07/18/1600x900/AP07-18-2024-000271A-0_1721328835158_1721328858152.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743607", "eventUri": "eng-9743607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett came out to the middle.\n\nThe Three Lions didn't get the start which they wanted as they lost the first wicket on the third ball of the match as Crawley was dismissed by Alzarri Joseph when the team score was 0.\n\nFollowing Crawley's departure, Ollie Pope came into bat along with Duckett.

The highest wicket-taker for the Kraigg Bratwaithe-led side was Joseph who snapped three wickets in his spell of 15.3 overs where he conceded 98 runs.\n\nTwo wickets each were bagged by Jayden Seales, Kevin Sinclair, and Kavem Hodge in their respective spells. Also, one wicket was taken by Shamar Joseph in his spell of 11.3 overs where he conceded 44 runs.\n\nBrief Score: England 416 all out in 88.3 overs (Pope 121, Duckett 71, Stokes 69, A Joseph 3-98) vs West Indies.

I know what I'm doing, I've perfected it over the years.\"\n\nPope grew in confidence, moving to his hundred with a crisp four through square leg before removing his helmet and raising his bat to the crowd.\n\nPope edged a catch to Kavem Hodge off Alzarri Joseph but captain Ben Stokes made a welcome return to form with the bat, hitting eight fours in his 69 before being caught off part-time spinner Hodge.\n\nJamie Smith (36) and Chris Woakes (37) chipped in down the order and England will feel confident of taking advantage of a positive start to move 2-0 up in the series following their

The second game of the three-match series between the teams is underway at Trent Bridge in Nottingham.\n\nEngland National Cricket Team have been asked to bat first in the ongoing second game against West Indies. The start of the game didn't go in their favour as they lost Zak Crawley for a three-ball duck but after that, it was Ben Duckett who stole the limelight with his brutal batting in the game.\n\nBen Duckett looked unfazed by the wicket of Zak Crawley at the other end and looked in terrific touch. He made sure he kept the scoring rate high for the team and took them off to a flying start in the second match of the series, putting the opposition under pressure.\n\nBen Duckett brought up his aggressive mode and played like T20I in Test cricket. The opening batter took the attack to the bowlers right from the start and smashed them all over the park. He seemed to be in a good mood as he hardly put a foot wrong in his innings.\n\nThanks to the brutal innings by Ben Duckett, England National Cricket Team brought up 50 runs in just 4.3 overs. This is the fastest-ever fifty by any team in the history of Test cricket. With the way he was going, West Indies bowlers looked clueless.\n\nBen Duckett also brought up his half-century in just 32 balls and registered the joint third-fastest half-century for England in Test cricket. He equaled Ian Botham's record in 32 balls and has Botham and Jonny Bairstow ahead of him as well in the list.\n\nFastest Test fifties for England (by balls faced)\n\n28 - Ian Botham vs India, Delhi, 1981\n\n30 - Jonny Bairstow vs New Zealand, Headingley, 2022\n\n32 - Ian Botham vs New Zealand, The Oval, 1986\n\n32 - Ben Duckett vs West Indies, Trent Bridge, 2024\n\nBen Duckett played a powerful hand for the England National Cricket Team and put them in a dominating position. The opening batter ended with an innings of 72 runs off 59 balls and also slammed 14 fours in his innings.

Trailing by 65 runs, the pair of Jason Holder and Joshua da Silva will look to establish a big partnership to help them establish a solid lead to put them in the driver's seat going into the final innings.\n\nEngland on the other hand are far from the dominant force that they were in the previous Test.

before putting up a big score.\n\nEngland had an injury scare yesterday with Mark Wood walking off the field but that could be cramps rather than a major physical concern, but the home side will hope to wrap things up fairly quickly or it can be yet another tiring day for Ben Stokes' side.\n\nShoaib Bashir will once again look to contribute with his long spells and hope that he can hold one end firmly and build up pressure while the others can hopefully capitalise with a few wickets.\n\nWest Indies will hope to ride out the new ball storm while England will hope to get some quick wickets and

He accomplished the milestone with a fiery fifty on Day 1 of the second Test against West Indies at Trent Bridge, Nottingham. The southpaw entered the game, requiring 62 runs to accomplish the mark. He also completed 1,500 Test runs during the course of his knock. Here are his stats.\n\nWI started well as Alzarri Joseph dismissed Zak Crawley for a duck. However, Duckett smashed Jayden Seales for four successive boundaries in the very next over. He continued to torment WI pacers as Ollie Pope supported him. Their brilliance meant England reached the 50-run mark in just 4.2 overs. Meanwhile, Duckett completed his fifty off just 32 balls.\n\nEarlier this year, Duckett went past 9,500 runs in First-Class cricket. He has now raced past 100,00 runs in 144 matches, averaging 42-plus. Interestingly, his strike rate is over 73. The tally includes 27 tons and 45 fifties with 282* being his best score. As mentioned, Duckett was 62 short of the 10,000-run landmark ahead of the Nottingham game.\n\nDuckett recorded the joint-third-fastest Test fifty by an England batter, off 32 balls. Ian Botham also took as many deliveries to complete his fifty against New Zealand at The Oval, 1986. Botham (28 balls vs India, 1981) also tops this list as Jonny Bairstow (30 balls vs NZ, 2022) holds the second place.\n\nPlaying his 22nd Test, Duckett has raced past 1,500 runs at an average of 39-plus (SR: 84-plus). He has smashed three tons and eight half-centuries in the format so far. As per ESPNcricinfo, Duckett has over 550 Test runs at home, averaging around 50.

The West Indies badly needed a strong outing after a demoralizing first test, but their handling errors proved costly. As well as Pope's twin reprieve, there were two more drops and a missed stumping as they failed to back their bowlers. As a result, England went on to pile 400 runs on the board, putting the West Indies on the back foot.\n\nVisiting captain Kraigg Brathwaite sprung a surprise at the toss when he sent England in to bat, a gamble that quickly came good when Alzarri Joseph snagged Zak Crawley's outside edge with the third ball of the match.\n\nEngland, though, were unfazed and Duckett set a rollicking pace in the morning session. The left-hander propelled his side to 50 quicker than any other in test history, in just 26 balls, and reached his own half-century in 32. Only Ian Botham and Jonny Bairstow have ever done it faster for England.\n\nHis hopes of converting his rapid half-century into three figures before lunch were ended by Shamar Joseph, who had him well caught at second slip. Had Athanaze held on to Pope in the last over before lunch, it might have changed things, but the chance tumbled to the turf and allowed England to rest easy on 134-2.\n\nJoe Root had a messy exit, hacking Jayden Seales to mid-on, and Harry Brook scooped Kevin Sinclair to short-leg for 36 to tee up an acrobatic somersault celebration from the spinner. Pope, however, matured as the innings went on and picked off a steady supply of loose offerings.\n\nHe reached his ton in style, sweeping Sinclair for four then stepping back to pull Seales through midwicket. Pope looked in control by the time Alzarri Joseph finally took an edge that stuck but England had plenty in the tank.\n\nStokes pulled powerfully as he ended a run of low scores with a punchy half-century, while Jamie Smith smashed two sixes in a cameo of 36. Both were caught trying to hammer poor deliveries from the slow bowlers, while Gus Atkinson was nicely caught at slip.

But Kraigg Brathwaite, West Indies' captain and the sole Test centurion in his top five, won the toss and elected to bowl first.\n\nBazball was born on this ground two years ago, when Ben Stokes did the same against New Zealand and Jonny Bairstow utterly vaporised a fourth innings target of 299. But even factoring that remarkable last Test here, it felt like a negative move and one that had not aged massively well by stumps. Powered by Ollie Pope's 121 and later burnished by 69 from Stokes, England raced to 416 all out in 88.3 overs.\n\nBen Duckett had very much signposted this possibility first thing. After the loss of Zak Crawley third ball the left-hander responded with a flurry of boundaries - including four in four off Jayden Seales's first over - and talk of Gilbert Jessop's cobwebbed record for the fastest Test century by an Englishman (76 balls) even began to percolate. That was until Duckett drove Shamar Joseph to slip and mooched off with 71 from 59 balls.\n\nInstead, it was Pope who made the three-figure score that the conditions were practically begging for. The England vice-captain was not always at his fluent best and was dropped either side of his half-century and lunch. But given some nagging, admittedly external doubts about his suitability for No 3, the right-hander's sixth Test century and first since that highwire 196 in Hyderabad in January was a welcome return to the runs column.\n\nThe same went for Stokes, who after his first half-century in 11 Test innings holed out off the part-time spin of Kavem Hodge trying to cash in before the second new ball. Stokes was not alone in this regard, Joe Root (14), Harry Brook (36) and Jamie Smith (36) all architects of their respective demises. Less culpable was Chris Woakes, whose useful 37 in his 50th Test match was ended by Seales, the second new ball, and an edge to slip.\n\nIt was tough going for West Indies who, despite bowling well in patches and throwing some late punches, did not exactly support Brathwaite's call at the toss along the way. The first of those lives granted to Pope, on 46, was a tough one, the ball scorching off the middle to Alick Athanaze at backward point. But the second, shelled by Jason Holder at slip after going fingers-up to a chance at chest height, was a dolly.\n\nBoth were costly, while some of the ground fielding was a bit shoddy at times. The pressure felt from England's aggressive intent only went so far by way of mitigation here.\n\nPerhaps the greatest frustration beyond the drops - four in total by the end - was Shamar Joseph who, despite halting Duckett's early onslaught, walked off the field clutching his left hamstring for the second successive Test match. The biggest plus for the tourists was probably Kevin Sinclair stepping off the bench after Gudakesh Motie fell ill overnight. On a day when Brathwaite's opening bowlers shipped a run a ball, the off-spinner offered control and threat for his captain with figures of two for 73 from 22 overs.\n\nSinclair is a bit of a showman, too, with the latest sold-out crowd treated to a wonderful somersault celebration when Brook tamely top-edged a paddle sweep after lunch. Sinclair told the BBC earlier this year that perfecting the leap was a way of staying out of trouble growing up in Berbice and Brook, whose earlier back-foot six might be the viral clip of the day, probably wished he flipping well had not.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ali_martin@theguardian.com", "name": "Ali Martin",

If it had been me unbeaten on 60-odd as lunch approached, as Duckett was on Thursday, I'd have been texting the wife, saying: 'Hang in there.'\n\nFaced with a batting surface like this, openers of the ilk of Graham Gooch and Geoff Boycott would have been booking in for bed and breakfast, adopting an 'over my dead body' approach to preserving their wicket.\n\nBut this England team were still thrashing at it, going at nearly five an over, and for good reason - because if this Trent Bridge pitch goes even flatter, the value of scoring quickly will be emphasised, as it was in Rawalpindi in late 2022 when they made a mountain of runs on day one and defeated Pakistan deep into the final day.\n\nDuckett epitomises this way of playing and going back a couple of years, his was an excellent selection.\n\nHe wasn't the name at the top of everyone's list of candidates when changes were required at the top of the order, but I remember Rob Key telling me on the outfield at the Oval that Brendon McCullum really liked him.\n\nBen Duckett (right) went into this Test match knowing he might miss a part of it to be at the birth of his first child\n\nDuckett hit 14 fours as he raced to 71 runs off 59 balls on Day One of the Second Test\n\nAt times Duckett is vulnerable outside that off-stump and he nicked off at Lord's last week,\n\nYou can see why. Traditionally, openers in England have left well. Think of Michael Atherton, Alastair Cook, Andrew Strauss. Duckett just doesn't.\n\nIn Test match cricket he lets about 2% of his deliveries go - a ridiculously low amount. Next is something like the 15% of Australia's David Warner.\n\nAt times he's vulnerable outside that off-stump and he nicked off at Lord's last week, but with him it's a classic case of risk and reward. If you don't leave in England, you will nick off. Yet he is only too aware that it's his strong area.\n\nHe's so good square of the wicket on the off side that if you're marginally out on line or length he'll just put you away for four.\n\nIf I'd been in West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite's shoes yesterday, I'd have done more of what Australia did in last year's Ashes and posted a sweeper on the off side immediately to counter his strength.\n\nHaving a man out there would also have encouraged him to run the ball through the offside in search of singles and that in turn would have brought the outside edge into play, but they kept the field up and he just kept belting it through there.\n\nI like his mindset. England lost the toss, then Zak Crawley in the first over, yet he didn't go into his shell.\n\nDuckett was eventually caught as Shamar Joseph took his first of two wickets on Day One\n\nBrendon McCullum has been a huge fan of Duckett and his just-whack-it mentality\n\nAn England side of just a few years ago would have tried to survive and gone nowhere, but Duckett put the bad balls away, put some good balls away too and West Indies momentum had gone when the 50 came up in 4.2 overs.\n\nRecall the number of times not so long ago that England lost early wickets and Joe Root came in at 20 for two, with openers trying to play the other way.\n\nFair play to Key, the ECB's managing director of men's cricket, because while he liked Dom Sibley, Haseeb Hameed and Rory Burns as people, he just didn't believe in going into survival mode at the top of the order. Key is a big fan of putting the bowler back under pressure.\n\nWhenever you get to 20 not out in a Test match, you feel a million dollars. Sometimes you have to grind so hard to do so. Duckett took half a dozen deliveries yesterday, was moving well at the crease and unconcerned about the prospect of another low score, set the tone perfectly.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

He continued his composed batting after lunch, reaching his half-century in 81 balls. The West Indies team missed opportunities to dismiss him, dropping him twice, which allowed him to maintain his momentum.\n\nPope's milestone century came in the 46th over, bowled by Jayden Seales. A well-placed boundary to deep square leg brought up his sixth Test hundred, completed in 143 balls. His innings was a blend of patience and aggression, crucial in bolstering England's position.\n\nPost-match, Pope revealed his delight in having Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale among the spectators at Trent Bridge.

Coming in after the early dismissal of Zak Crawley, Pope steadied the innings and played a vital role in England's batting performance.\n\nPope formed a crucial partnership with opener Ben Duckett, who played a fine knock of 71 runs.

Pope's splendid innings came to an end at 121 runs off 167 balls, including 15 boundaries and a six. His knock was crucial in setting a strong total for England and was met with applause from fans and teammates alike.", "source": {"uri": "crickettimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketTimes.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "akshat_gaur@crickettimes.com", "name": "Akshat Gaur", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Bridge", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trent Bridge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Pope", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Duckett", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Duckett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Crawley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zak Crawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Brook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Brook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Root", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Root"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://crickettimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Ollie-Pope-hits-a-magnificent-ton-in-ENG-vs-WI-2nd-Test.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743607", "eventUri": "eng-9743607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

In the following session, Holder also had an opportunity to send Pope back to the pavilion, but the chance went begging.\n\nJoe Root was on 14 when he mistimed a pull shot off Jayden Seales' delivery. The ball ballooned up in the air, and Alzarri Joseph safely pouched the catch.\n\nHarry Brook looked in fine touch, swiftly reaching 36, which included a six over backward point. However, his innings came to an end when he attempted a paddle sweep against spinner Kevin Sinclair.\n\nThe ball took the edge and landed in the hands of Kirk McKenzie at short leg. Sinclair, elated with the wicket, celebrated by performing a backward somersault.\n\nPope's confidence surged as he progressed towards his century, reaching the milestone with a well-timed shot that raced to the boundary at square leg. Upon achieving this feat, he removed his helmet and acknowledged the applause from the spectators by raising his bat.\n\nHowever, Pope's innings came to an end when he nicked a delivery from Alzarri Joseph, presenting a catch to Kavem Hodge. England's skipper Ben Stokes found his form with the willow, striking eight boundaries en route to a valuable 69 before falling victim to the part-time spin of Hodge.\n\nContributions from Jamie Smith (36) and Chris Woakes (37) further bolstered England's total in the latter stages of the innings. With this strong start, the hosts will be optimistic about their chances of securing a 2-0 lead in the series, having already triumphed by an innings in the opening Test at Lord's.\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

However, the ball hit the bottom of the bat and a chunk of the willow came off immediately.\n\nTalking about the game, England were on 58 for 1 in the second innings at the time of writing this report with Ollie Pope on 33 and Duckett on 19. England would be hoping that Pope and Duckett continue their fine display with the bat in the game and guide them to a big score. Pope had scored 121 runs while Duckett had scored 71 runs in the first innings.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Pope", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Crawley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zak Crawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Bridge", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Bridge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crease_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crease (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Duckett", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Duckett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzarri_Joseph", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alzarri Joseph"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://static.cricketaddictor.com/images/2024/Ollieapopebatbroken.webp?q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743607", "eventUri": "eng-9743607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Anderson has been moved into this role keeping the 2025-26 Ashes series in Australia in mind in order to groom newer stars into world-class bowlers.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports during the innings break, Anderson said that the past few days have been interesting for him.\n\n\"It has been an interesting few days, I have had to deal with the emotions of Lord's and then come straight here and into a new job. I have loved it,\" said Anderson.\n\n\"I have known most of the bowlers for many years, nice to just relax and not try to bowl the tail out on a flat one,\" he added.\n\nThe fast bowler bid farewell to Test cricket after the first Test at Lord's as the third-highest Test wicket-taker to grace the game.\n\nThe 41-year-old took four wickets in the Test match to finish with 704 career scalps in the format, the third behind Muttiah Muralidaran and the late Shane Warne.\n\nThe hosts thumped the Caribbeans by an innings and 114 runs in the Test match. Some of the legends of the sport, both past and present, took to social media and acknowledged Anderson's contribution to cricket for over two decades.\n\nIn the second Test, the West Indies won the toss and opted to bowl first.\n\nEngland delivered a fine batting performance, powered by Ollie Pope's sixth Test ton and fine half-centuries from Ben Duckett and skipper Ben Stokes . England made 416/10 in 88.3 overs.\n\nAlzarri Joseph was the pick of the bowlers for WI. Jayden Seales, Kavem Hodge, Kevin Sinclair took two wickets, while Shamar Joseph got one wicket.\n\nIn their first innings, WI was struggling at 84/3, staring at yet another potential big loss. However, Alick Athanaze and Kavem Hodge pulled out a brilliant counter-attacking partnership of 175 runs. Later on, wicketkeeper-batter Joshua da Silva pulled off an impressive 71-run partnership for the tenth wicket along with Shamar Joseph , which helped WI breach England's first innings score and take a 41-run lead. WI was bundled out for 457 runs in 111.5 overs.\n\nChris Woakes was the top wicket-taker for England. Young pacer Gus Atkinson and spinner Shoaib Bashir also took two wickets each while skipper Ben Stokes and Mark Wood got one.\n\nEngland will now be aiming to overcome this slender trail in their

Anderson has been moved into this role keeping the 2025-26 Ashes series in Australia in mind in order to groom newer stars into world-class bowlers.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports during the innings break, Anderson said that the past few days have been interesting for him.\n\n\"It has been an interesting few days, I have had to deal with the emotions of Lord's (where the first Test was played) and then come straight here and into a new job. I have loved it,\" said Anderson.\n\n\"I have known most of the bowlers for many years, nice to just relax and not try to bowl the tail out on a flat one,\" he added.\n\nThe fast bowler bid farewell to Test cricket after the first Test at Lord's as the third-highest Test wicket-taker to grace the game.\n\nThe 41-year-old took four wickets in the Test match to finish with 704 career scalps in the format, the third behind Muttiah Muralidaran and the late Shane Warne.\n\nThe hosts thumped the Caribbeans by an innings and 114 runs in the Test match. Some of the legends of the sport, both past and present, took to social media and acknowledged Anderson's contribution to cricket for over two decades.\n\nIn the second Test, the West Indies won the toss and opted to bowl first.\n\nEngland delivered a fine batting performance, powered by Ollie Pope's sixth Test ton (121 in 167 balls, with 15 fours and a six) and fine half-centuries from Ben Duckett (71 in 59 balls, with 14 fours) and skipper Ben Stokes (69 in 104 balls, with eight fours). England made 416/10 in 88.3 overs.\n\nAlzarri Joseph (3/98) was the pick of the bowlers for WI. Jayden Seales, Kavem Hodge, Kevin Sinclair took two wickets, while Shamar Joseph got one wicket.\n\nIn their first innings, WI was struggling at 84/3, staring at yet another potential big loss. However, Alick Athanaze (82 in 99 balls, with 10 fours and a six) and Kavem Hodge (120 in 171 balls, with 19 fours) pulled out a brilliant counter-attacking partnership of 175 runs. Later on, wicketkeeper-batter Joshua da Silva (82* in 122 balls, with 10 fours and three sixes) pulled off an impressive 71-run partnership for the tenth wicket along with Shamar Joseph (33 in 27 balls, with five fours and two sixes), which helped WI breach England's first innings score and take a 41-run lead. WI was bundled out for 457 runs in 111.5 overs.\n\nChris Woakes (4/84) was the top wicket-taker for England. Young pacer Gus Atkinson and spinner Shoaib Bashir also took two wickets each while skipper Ben Stokes and Mark Wood got one.\n\nEngland will now be aiming to overcome this slender trail in their second inning and set a massive target for the visitors to seal the series 2-0.

AP\n\nComing into the second Test, West Indies' hopes of getting back into the series appeared to be something of a long shot. After Day One at Trent Bridge, it seems unfortunately as if it is one that they have fired straight into their own foot.\n\nFor the tourists, the self-sabotage started before play had begun: winning the toss and choosing to bowl, despite the sun beating down from bright blue Nottinghamshire skies. Given the West Indies had barely managed to make 250 in both their innings combined at Lord's, you can perhaps forgive a little trepidation at batting first, but if ever there were conditions to do so, these were it.\n\nIf the wicket of Zak Crawley from the third ball of the innings provided a morsel of justification for the decision, the West Indies soon saw it thrashed to all parts of the ground, Ben Duckett taking 19 runs from Jayden Seales' first over - the second of the game.\n\nIt was as if England were trying to show, in as cartoonish a style possible, that batting first on this pitch was the only way to go, they had 50 runs on the board after just 4.2 overs - there have surely been slower scoring T20 games on this ground.\n\nIn reality though the West Indies bowlers were simply woefully profligate, doubling down on the bad decision at the toss with a failure to put the opposition under any real pressure with the ball. Rarely can a wicket in the first over have felt quite so inconsequential.\n\nThe bowlers though were not entirely to blame for everything, the general sloppiness extended to the West Indies' performance in the field, there were almost too many misfields to keep count, and by the end of the play, it felt as if there had been far more of them than good deliveries bowled - never an ideal place to be as a bowling side.\n\nThen there were the dropped catches, four in all by the end of the day. Chief to capitalise was Ollie Pope, dropped twice by West Indies fielders, he made them pay with a sixth Test century.\n\nIn truth though it was not his greatest innings, not just because of the two catches he offered but all too often he was unable to find gaps in the field, picking out fielders with regularity. However ultimately he will surely not be too dissatisfied with his day's work, he finished with 121, while his partnership with Duckett of 105 from just 112 balls set the tone for England early on.\n\nSelf-sabotage though was seemingly in the air because England, playing the part of generous hosts, also failed to truly make the most of several dominant positions they found themselves during the day. Both Joe Root and Harry Brook were guilty of giving their wickets away with poor shots, as England faltered a little following their electric start.\n\nThen later with Ben Stokes and Jamie Smith appearing on the cusp of really grinding home England's advantage, both men also fell cheaply, and to make matters worse, to the part-time spin of Kavem Hodge.\n\nAll in all, it meant England will perhaps feel a little rueful at having 'only' made 416 all out by the close of play, more ruthless sides would have really taken the opposition apart given the same opportunities. However, it is nothing compared to the regret the West Indies must be feeling, a day filled with avoidable errors that threaten to immediately smother any slim hopes they had of getting back into this series.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Indies"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Bridge", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trent Bridge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lord's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Duckett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Duckett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Crawley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zak Crawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottinghamshire_County_Cricket_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Seales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Seales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caught"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Smith_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Smith (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Pope", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Brook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Brook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stokes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Stokes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Root", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Root"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/07/ENG-vs-WI-2nd-Test-2024-07-6bf290328e583d9477997dc6e47cd253-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743607", "eventUri": "eng-9743607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

The Three Lions are 1-0 up in the series having won the series opener.\n\nEven though the post James Anderson era has started for England with this Test, with the focus of the Lord's Test happening to be around his farewell, West Indies batter Kirk McKenzie's dismissal did turn some heads in their first innings of the second Test.\n\nThe incident happened in the third ball in the 25th over when Bashir flighted a delivery enticing McKenzie to go for an aerial stroke. The batter fell in the trap set by the bowler and ended up hitting one straight to Ben Stokes who was stationed at mid-on.\n\nREAD HERE | ENG vs WI 2nd Test Live Streaming, Telecast: Where To Watch England vs West Indies Match?\n\nHowever, commentator Nasser Hussain on air went on to describe Bashir's delivery as \"very close to being a no-ball.\" Even though the third umpire eventually ruled it in favour of the bowler, the dismissal was enough to raise eyebrows as McKenzie fell for 11 off 27.\n\nMeanwhile, Ollie Pope'e century took England to 416 in their first innings. Pope was sensational as his innings was studded with 15 fours and a six. Ben Duckett (71 off 59) and Ben Stokes (69 off 104) also chipped in with half-centuries to take the hosts to a solid total.\n\nALSO READ | ENG vs WI 2nd Test: England's Bazball Scripts World Record By Bringing Up Fastest Team Fifty In Test History\n\nWith the ball in hand, Shoaib Bashir and Gut Atkinson have been amongst the wickets for England thus far.

We also feel like we left a couple out there which I think is a really good sign for where we're at as a batting unit.\n\n\"When you get put into bat and put 416 on the board, you can't complain.\"\n\nPope's batting was emblematic of the Bazball philosophy as he smashed 15 boundaries and one six during his outing to quieten any doubters about his eventual future as Stokes' successor.\n\nPope's bid to become the future leader of the England's Test team was enhanced by his appointment as full-time vice-captain in May last year, and during the reign of Stokes and head coach Brendon McCullum the 26-year-old has established himself as England's No 3.\n\nPope admitted that he felt like he was improving as a batter but couldn't see those changes materialise on the field as he struggled during the County Championship season with Surrey and in the Vitality Blast hit 142 runs at an average of 47.33.\n\n\"Things weren't really clicking for me in the county stuff before this and I couldn't work out why because I felt like I was becoming a better player,\" Pope said.\n\n\"For me, it was about trying to trust my defence as best I can. I felt I was getting better but the runs and the results weren't there.\n\n\"It was probably the first time in county cricket that I'd had that and it wasn't clear why.\n\n\"A lot of it was about temperament. I found a nice routine going into a Test match and walking out to bat I just had that clarity of mind about how I wanted to go about my innings.\"\n\nSky Sports Cricket's Stuart Broad praised Ollie Pope's performance saying that England trust their No 3 batter enough to give him plenty of opportunities.\n\n\"Especially at Trent Bridge, he loves batting here. In 2022, he got a great century against New Zealand,\" Broad said.\n\n\"He's such a clean striker of the ball, so when these pitches come on nicely with a quick outfield, he looks in such fine form.\n\n\"But the gully chance, trickier than the slip chance to be honest, but both very catchable. At this level, if you give top-class batters opportunities they will punish you.\n\n\"He's not scored many runs since his brilliant hundred in India and there's no doubt the whole changing room will have been thrilled for him getting that hundred today.\n\n\"I think his spot is safe in that England side. He's batting, I think, in the most difficult position at No 3.\n\n\"He's a fine player, he's a brilliant character within the group and he's trusted in that spot. We know this England set-up with Stokes and McCullum like to give players a lot of opportunities to find form and that hundred in India was one of the best away hundreds you're ever going to see.\n\n\"I'm delighted to see him get a hundred, he deserved that.\"\n\nWatch day two of the second Test between England and West Indies, from Trent Bridge in Nottingham, live on Sky Sports Cricket from 10am on Friday (first ball to be bowled at 11am).\n\nStream Sky Sports live with no contract on a Month or Day membership on NOW.

After losing the toss, England posted 416 runs on the board before getting bundled out in the 89th over. Ollie Pope was the star for the hosts smashing 121 runs with 15 fours and a six while Duckett and skipper Ben Stokes scored fifties.\n\nEngland got off to a poor start losing Zak Crawley in the very first over but that didn't have any effect on Duckett as he went about his business staying true to Bazball philosophy. In the process, he also climbed the ladder in the list of most runs scored in the ongoing World Test Championship 2023-25. He is currently the sixth highest run-getter in the third edition of WTC with 738 runs to his name in 21 innings at an average of 35.14 with a century and three fifties to his name.\n\nHis 71-run knock helped him go past India skipper Rohit Sharma as well who is now at the eighth place in the list. Rohit has so far scored 700 runs in 16 innings in this WTC at an average of 46.66 with three centuries and as many half-centuries. Rohit is currently enjoying the break away from the game after winning the T20 World Cup 2024 in the West Indies and USA beating South Africa in the final.\n\nHe will next feature in the three-match ODI series in Sri Lanka in the first week of August and will only be able to return to Test cricket during the home season in September when India is scheduled to host Bangladesh and New Zealand.

University students and their parents are in town for their graduation ceremonies, most of which take place this week. The city is hosting the Touch Rugby World Cup, which has a record 188 teams - Australia alone has sent 13 of them - representing nations from Chile to Chinese Taipei and from Lebanon to Luxembourg. In the evenings, after the action at the university's Highfields Sport Complex winds down, the city centre hums with groups in liveried singlets or flag-emblazoned T-shirts, scurrying through the cobbled laneways seeking somewhere to socialise.\n\nAnd into this a Test match has been squeezed. In short, these are heady days for the city's hospitality industry. At a budget hotel on Wednesday a receptionist, checking in a guest, tapped their details into the computer and suddenly looked up, shocked: \"Do you know how much you're paying for this?\" With all these visitors and the belated arrival of summer driving people out into the streets, at times the town feels ready to burst.\n\nA few minutes after 11am, England having been put in to bat, Ben Duckett looked around and saw nothing but space.\n\nLast year Pat Cummins got all sorts of abuse for scattering fielders around the boundary at the start of England's first innings of the Ashes, an approach which was considered both too defensive and also not defensive enough, allowing batters to score easy singles, rotate the strike and generally live stress-free lives. \"They've gone defensive straight away,\" complained Ricky Ponting. \"I'm not a huge fan. If the scoreboard continually ticks over, batsmen never feel under pressure at all. With that field, where are you expected to bowl?\"\n\nIt was impossible not to think back to those moments as Duckett repeatedly smeared the ball through an empty outfield in the first few overs. Kraigg Brathwaite had taken precisely the opposite approach to Cummins, preferring to keep his fielders close and challenge England's batters to find a way past them. The problem was, they could.\n\nIt took just 26 balls for England to score their first 50. They failed to score off 11 of those deliveries and scored boundaries off another 11, Duckett responsible for seven of them. By the time the players took drinks, an hour into the day and immediately after the game's first maiden over, England had 86 and Duckett was on 60.\n\nBrathwaite's decision at the toss, under cloudless blue skies, to bowl rather than bat indicated a fundamental lack of confidence in a callow batting group, but his side's weaknesses are varied enough to not be easily hidden and his bowling unit is only comparatively strong. Every captain feels it necessary from time to time to jog over to a struggling bowler, rest a consoling hand upon his shoulder and give him a pep talk; the first time Brathwaite was moved to do so the game was just 10 deliveries old.\n\nDespite the morale boost of Alzarri Joseph finding Zak Crawley's edge with the third ball of the day, Alick Athenaze taking an excellent catch at third slip, West Indies swiftly became ragged. The second over went for 19, the third for 12. But for an uptick in the hour before lunch there was little consistency from the bowlers, and though it took a while - and Jason Holder produced another good catch in the cordon to curtail Duckett's boundary-bothering - the fielding eventually frayed as well.\n\nAt times the action seemed fundamentally unserious, which in many ways is fine - cricket is, as Ben Stokes has said, an entertainment business and a mix of quality and comedy is arguably ideal. Harry Brook completely fluffed a scoop and ballooned a catch to short leg, prompting an acrobatic, somersaulting celebration from the bowler, Kevin Sinclair. For the second time in the series Shamar Joseph was helped from the field mid-over after suffering from cramp. Alzarri Joseph, easily identifiable thanks to his ostentatious canary-yellow watch, was presented with the easiest possible catch by Joe Root and dropped it twice, the ball bobbling helpfully upwards on both occasions and allowing him to take it at the third attempt, a passage of play that would have been equally at home in a circus tent as on a cricket field. Ollie Pope looked out of sorts, was dropped just before lunch on 46 and just after lunch on 54, and still ended up with a handsome century and the fifth-highest score of his Test career. Somehow his was the outstanding performance but, perhaps appropriately given the way the day had begun - if not the state of the city - it wasn't exactly a crowded field.", "source": {"uri":

As it was, Pope went into Lunch unbeaten on 47 a ball later, and reached his half-century two overs after the break.\n\nOn 54, however, he gave another chance. This one really should have been the end, slashed to Jason Holder at second slip but inexplicably fumbled. When you reach a century, there's no caveat on the scorecard, no asterisk stating the number of times a player should have been out, nothing to say their innings has been anything other than a masterclass.\n\nPope's 121 at Trent Bridge wasn't a masterclass. There was a familiar freneticism at the start, coming in during the first over after Zak Crawley missed out on a good pitch. Early on, he was squared up and kept in line as Ben Duckett plundered runs at the other end. But, as he neared three figures, there was more control. He chose the deliveries to score off with more purpose, punishing the plethora of bad balls the West Indies attack dealt him while reining in his aggression before it reached recklessness.\n\nHaving made 57 in his previous innings at Lord's, it adds up to a near-perfect start to a Test summer Pope came into needing to make the grade. He was given a significant run-in at his happiest hunting ground, playing seven County Championship matches for Surrey before joining up with England. But, from those 10 innings, he averaged 22.88 and passed 50 only once. While this was no cause for immediate alarm given the credit he has in the bank, a continuation of this lean form would have shone a harsher light on that run and what came before it.\n\nPope's imperious 196 in Hyderabad - an innings hailed by Joe Root as \"one of the best he'd ever seen\" - was followed by a drought for the rest of the series in India. After that innings, his high score for the series was 39 and his average for the series, even with his Hyderabad heroics, was 31.50. What had looked like a turning point instead continued the narrative that Pope's runs have mainly come on flat tracks or against weaker opposition.\n\nThe talent Pope possesses should never be in doubt. Touches of genius like the ducked-scoop in India, the 90-ball century in Rawalpindi and what he's produced time after time for Surrey have shown what England have on their hands. The frustration isn't that Pope isn't good enough to play for England's Test side for many years, but that anything but retiring as an England great will be less than his potential.\n\nAfter 45 Tests, Pope averages 35.52. It's fine, but everything about watching him play says he should be averaging in the mid 40s as a minimum. If he is to be that player, groomed for potential future captaincy and set to be one of the locks of England's future, centuries like the one he scored today are bread and butter. Against a flagging opposition on a good pitch, the runs were there for the taking. That Pope took them today puts him back to where he should be.\n\nEqually, despite their dominance at Lord's, none of the five batters who made half centuries went onto three figures. It's welcome for England that one of their number converted in the types of conditions that should be ripe for runs, and at this point only a moderate concern that the rest haven't yet been ruthless.\n\nCrawley is the only one of England's lineup that can really say they were undone by a jaffa today. Root made a mess of a pull shot just after Lunch, Harry Brook horribly mistimed a pull shot to give Kevin Sinclair something to somersault about. Ben Stokes was probably the most egregious culprit, closing in on what looked a near-certain triumphant century, he holed out from the tamest floaty length ball you'll ever see. Even new golden-boy Jamie Smith wasn't immune, slapping another non-threatening ball to Jason Holder at long-on.\n\nBy the time of Smith's wicket, England probably had enough runs to win the match comfortably - perhaps even without needing to bat again. But with Stokes keeping an eye on the Ashes in 18 months time, throwing away a position of utter control isn't the bedrock of rare away Ashes wins. Pope's hundred was still the story, but it's not accompanied by an undertone of England dominance.", "source": {"uri": "wisden.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wisden"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Pope", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lord's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Duckett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Duckett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Crawley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zak Crawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Bridge", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Bridge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Holder", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Holder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouncer_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bouncer (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Indies"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Root", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Root"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawalpindi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rawalpindi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rawalpindi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Brook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Brook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stokes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Stokes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ashes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Ashes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.wisden.com/static-assets/waf-images/76/d6/df/16-9/PizvkRInw0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9743607", "eventUri": "eng-9743607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

West Indies Test early", "body": "Joe Denly made a Test-best 94 after missing an Ashes Test session back in 2019\n\nEngland opener Ben Duckett could miss part of the second Test against West Indies at his home ground of Trent Bridge to be at the birth of his first child.\n\nDuckett, 29, has been given the blessing of captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum to leave the match if his partner Paige goes into labour - opening the possibility of him being 'retired out' should he be at the crease at the end of a session or a day's play.\n\n'We'll just have to make a decision if it was to happen before the game started,' said Stokes.\n\n'If anything happens throughout the Test match, Ben will just go and come back into the team.\n\n'He's obviously desperate to play at his home ground but the message from me and Baz is family always comes first.'\n\nBen Duckett could be forced to leave the second Test early to be with his partner Paige for the birth of their first child\n\nDuckett has been given the blessing of captain Ben Stokes (pictured) and coach Brendon McCullum\n\nSurrey's Dan Lawrence is the standby batsman in the squad, but would only be available to replace Duckett in the XI before the morning's toss.\n\nBy the laws of the game, once play has started, substitutes are permitted solely for incidents of concussion - meaning England potentially face batting with 10 men for an innings dependent on length of absence.\n\nIt is not the first time an England cricketer has been faced with this kind of stay-or-go conundrum during a home Test.\n\nIndeed, Stokes owed his debut as Test captain to Joe Root opting to be present for the arrival of his daughter Isabella during the Covid summer of 2020 - a defeat to the Windies in Southampton.\n\nMichael Vaughan was also faced with an unmissable delivery while captaining his country, temporarily quitting the Headingley Test win over New Zealand in 2004 to be alongside wife Nichola in welcoming Tallulah Grace to the world.\n\nVaughan exited the field with an hour's play remaining on day two, handing over to vice-captain Marcus Trescothick and dashing down the M1 to Sheffield in what was the first occurrence of an England cricketer leaving a game in such circumstances.\n\nFormer batter Joe Denly made a Test-best 94 back in the 2019 Ashes after missing a morning session for the birth of his child\n\nHe returned next morning a dad and was permitted to bat in his usual position of no 4, despite his absence, as match referee Clive Lloyd said his situation was 'very exceptional'.\n\nJoe Denly missed a morning session of an Ashes match at the Oval in 2019 for the same reason, following up with a Test-best 94 next day.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

{"id": 243323688, "title": "Dean Smith signing has already shown Aston Villa how to deal with Moussa Diaby", "text": "Aston Villa's multi-million pound import Moussa Diaby supposedly has interest from Saudi Arabia this summer. Cristiano Ronaldo's Al-Nassr are reportedly keen to complete a deal for Diaby, who only arrived from Bayer Leverkusen last summer for a then club record fee and on a five-year deal. While Diaby didn't quite hit the soaring heights predicted by some, there were encouraging signs in the final third of the season, enough to excite heading into his second year. Diaby hit the ground running shortly after arriving last summer; his strikes at Newcastle United and Burnley were as clinical as they come. Diaby made an impact on the European stage, too, as he displayed early signs of relationships being built up with Ollie Watkins and his fellow attackers. Diaby joined at a time when Villa and Unai Emery were making no bones about their intent to clearly upgrade aspects of their squad. Having lost creative figure Emi Buendia to injury, there might even have been a little more onus on Diaby - who'd have been on his way to the club irrespective of the Argentine's injury - to perform immediately than was already expected of him. It certainly didn't appear to faze him in those opening weeks of the season. READ: Emery has made feelings clear on Ramsey amid Tottenham cash plus player bid READ: Villa hatch \u00a330m Man City transfer plan for shock Champions League qualifier Without scoring, Diaby continued to contribute. He set up a couple in the battering of Brighton, and then he produced again in the home victory over Luton Town in October. There have been the odd moments since - the goal at home to Burnley after Christmas and the consolation against Chelsea in the FA Cup - but, in general, Diaby's spark was snuffed out. He even lost his place in the starting XI in the spring; Diaby didn't start a league game between the defeat at home to Newcastle in January and the end of March - and when was introduced he didn't quite hit those heights which excited everybody concerned with Villa towards the beginning of the season. Pertinently, his loss in front of goal was Leon Bailey's gain. The Jamaican has been a talent long before he arrived at Villa Park, but this past year he produced like never before. Indeed it'd be fair comment to admit that Bailey's numbers this past season were the sorts of stats that we might've anticipated would belong to Diaby, certainly after witnessing those opening weeks of the season. Bailey was a man possessed throughout the winter as he terrorised full-backs, supplied teammates and chipped in with plenty of strikes of his own. Now playing under his third manager at Villa, Emery seemed to unlock Bailey last year. \"The adaptation for some players is longer, then we need to understand the adaptation, how each player can do it differently,\" Emery said of Bailey during his particularly fruitful patch. \"He came from Germany and the first year he didn\u2019t play being consistent and he had some injuries. When I arrived here I tried to set him as a second striker and for him to take the best characteristics. \"He was still in the adaptation when I arrived here and the adaptation is everything. More or less, at the end, we can watch him on the pitch and this year he didn\u2019t start really being strong even and last year he was not consistent always. For example, the last two matches we played last season, key matches, he wasn\u2019t in the starting XI. \"I spoke with him this year when we started pre-season about how we could improve different issues and things he wasn\u2019t showing us in a consistent way. I explained it to him. \u2018No Leon, I want more. We need more of you. You have to be consistent and focus more than you are doing because it is not enough\u2019. His commitment has improved and his focus working every day harder has improved. \"His way here, his skills, scoring goals, assists, improves. We decided more or less one month ago to extend his contract. We had to be very demanding with the players and if they want to increase their level and their demands like the team is doing, then it has to change. We spoke to him, he is happy here, happy in Birmingham and Aston Villa. He is working progressively better.\" Diaby, then, had to wait his turn while Bailey, who signed a new contract last season, shone up top with Watkins. With many places in the starting XI soldered down by key personnel, there were few ways back into the side while those players were performing. Morgan Rogers' arrival in January only increased the competition for spots out wide further. \u201cI spoke with him and usually we are meeting with the squad, with the team collectively and individually too,\" Emery said when asked about Diaby's performances. \"I send them the same message - we are building a team and we are in that process. In the summer we brought in some players and now in January too. With everybody we have to try to get stronger in our structure in the squad. We have quality players and specialist in different positions. \u201cOne of them is Moussa Diaby and I am happy with him. His commitment is high and his behaviour is fantastic. His performances haven\u2019t been consistent but I can understand because he is in the process of understanding everything. He is adapting in the Premier League which is difficult. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s more difficult than in Germany, but it is difficult. We are always trying to send him the same message - we are building a team collectively. \"You have to understand and practise a lot how we can combine with different players in our tactical idea and get stronger when we face each match. He is in the process and with this process I am happy. The most important thing for me is is the commitment and behaviour everyday. He is always with his teammates practising and trying to improve.\u201d While Bailey, now three years into his stay at Villa and whose goal involvements last year were one per 1.9 games in all competitions, Diaby's campaign had become rather disjointed. He did, though, enjoy a stronger end to the campaign. The Frenchman popped up with a goal and an assist when Emery granted him a way back into the starting XI against Wolves. He had just teed up Lucas Digne's dramatic winner at Luton Town, too, and fashioned an assist for Nicolo Zaniolo at West Ham. Diaby was then handed 90 minutes in the exhilarating draw with Liverpool in the final home game of the season and took his chance when setting up Jhon Duran for his late equaliser. He'd also fired against Olympiacos and Ajax in the Conference League throughout the spring. While spent big to bring him to the club from Leverkusen, for a player new to English football and whose output was immediately expected to be sky high, Diaby can be pleased with how he concluded his campaign. As Diaby did, Bailey burst onto the scene a couple of years ago too; all three of his Premier League goal involvements came before the end of October, including the goal in the 3-0 win as Villa blitzed Everton under Dean Smith. His influenced waned thereafter but, a little further down the line, Bailey under Emery became one of the most in-form players in the country. There might be a frustration for many that Diaby hasn't fired fully yet, certainly over the course of a season, but there is surely no better example to follow than his teammate's heading into the new season and, in the face of interest from abroad, unless an offer was to be presented which Villa couldn't possibly turn away, then there already exists a perfect case study which shows why Diaby can take the Premier League by storm next term.

He\u2019s believed to have suffered a severe heart attack when the Singapore Airlines flight plunged 7,000ft in just six minutes, and his wife is still in hospital.

In many cases, turbulence is light, causing just a few bumps. In all, around 65,000 flights encounter moderate turbulence every year, and about 5,500 encounter severe turbulence, according to the National Centre for Atmospheric Research.

The incident occurred about 6:30 p.m. Tuesday in Baxter, Minn., at Hwy. 371 and Excelsior Road, the State Patrol said. Patrol Lt. Jill Frankfurth said the larger SUV's driver, a 60-year-old man, was killed. The other driver, a 55-year-old woman, survived, the lieutenant said. The patrol said their identities will be released Thursday. \"The cause of the crash is under investigation, and no arrests have been made,\" Frankfurth said. According to the patrol: The Range Rover \"started to make contact\" with the Buick Encore while both were heading east on Excelsior and nearing Hwy. 371. After the light turned green, the Range Rover made contact again with the Buick, this time pushing it into a spinout. The Range Rover then veered to the right and struck Bill's Gun Range to the southeast of the intersection, where there are several major retail outlets.", "summary": "The incident occurred about 6:30 p.m. Tuesday at Hwy. 371 and Excelsior Road, the State Patrol said.", "url": "https://www.startribune.com/driver-of-large-suv-hits-smaller-one-from-behind-twice-in-baxter-then-crashes-into-building-and-dies/600369417/", "image": "https://www.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:28:47", "author": "Paul Walsh,Star Tribune", "authors": ["Paul Walsh", "Star Tribune"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.684}

These 14 seats are mostly fall under BJP's area of influence,\" they argue.\n\nThe constituencies include Chikkodi, Belgaum, Bagalkot, Bijapur, Gulbarga, Raichur, Bidar, Koppal, Bellary, Haveri, Dharwad, Uttara Kannada, Davangere and Shimoga.\n\nBut what about public sentiments\n\nPerceptions and public sentiments play a major role in any elections and the Congress is using the issue to call out BJP on its \"hypocrisy\" by juxtaposing it with PM Modi's famous 'Beti bachao beti padhao' slogan.\n\nAccording to ground reports, pictures of Revanna and PM Modi together are doing the rounds on social media and the Congress is using it to corner the BJP in its Lingayat support base in the region.\n\n\"Revanna has given the Congress a powerful tool against the BJP which was highlighting the murder of Neha Hiremath by a Muslim youth in Hubballi to corner the saffron party. Voters, including in rural areas, are aware that such a crime has been committed however much the BJP may think otherwise. It will impact women voters who may either vote against the BJP or will not vote at all,\" claim BJP's adversaries.\n\nThough BJP leaders say the issue \"will not impact voters' decision or mind\", observers point to the party's nuanced step back on Neha Hiremath' murder and PM Modi's 400 plus pledge.\n\nKarnataka -- 14 seats\n\nThe issue is reverberating in the state where 14 of the 28 constituencies will poll in Phase-3, as per BJP's rivals.\n\nIt has already led to heated national-level exchanges between the Congress and the BJP with Congress leaders alleging that PM Modi shared the stage with Revanna which is why the BJP \"helped him flee the country\".\n\nGround reports suggest that it was the first time a sex scandal was publicly and widely exposed without the use of social media.\n\nApparently USB drives were distributed directly to people just five days before the voting in Hassan.\n\n\"The issue may not have influenced voting in the earlier phase in Karnataka as USB drives were distributed only in Hassan but with the publicity it has received since then, it is only but natural that the BJP should be worried. However, the exact damage and whether Congress managed to leverage the issue will only be known after the votes are counted,\" they add.\n\nBJP leaders also admit that it would have been better off without the \"embarrassing situation\". At the same time they also add that the BJP-JDS coalition would \"emerge victorious\" in Karnataka.\n\nAs many as 13 states, including PM Modi's home state Gujarat, and Union Territories will cast their votes in phase 3 election on May 7. This phase includes all seats in Gujarat, Goa, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu along with key constituencies in states like Karnataka, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, majority of which are considered BJP strongholds.\n\nRevanna 'scandal'\n\nRevanna is the grandson of JD(S) patriarch and former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda.\n\nThe probe agency has also issued a notice to his father and JD(S) MLA H D Revanna, causing a major embarrassment to Karnataka allies JD(S) and BJP.\n\nPrajwal \"fled\" the country soon after his constituency polled on April 26 and now stands suspended by the JD(S).", "source": {"uri": "tribuneindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prajwal_Revanna", "type": "person",

These videos were collected when they were in power and were released during the elections after the Vokkaligas exercised their right to vote, he added.\n\nThe videos were released after his expulsion from the country, the prime minister said, calling the development highly suspicious.

The regional party enjoys influence in southern Karnataka, particularly among the Vokkaligas, the community to which Gowda belongs.\n\nTo a question on his accusations against the Congress on issues such as inheritance tax and wealth redistribution, the Prime Minister said he had cited the language, words and written assurance of the party and its leaders to make their point of view.\n\n\"This time I exposed them to the end. That's why they are shaken. When they go to seek the votes of one community, they speak differently, and when they address the other community, They take a neutral position. This is their duplicity,\" he said.\n\nThis is different from the BJP which has always talked about construction of Ram temple, abrogation of Article 370 and Uniform Civil Code, he noted.\n\nOn the other hand, the Congress has been constantly lying by attacking the BJP by claiming that it has plans to amend the Constitution, he said, adding that some BJP members have said something and that Congress overdid it.\n\n\"They refuse to hear our version.

Deve Gowda escaping to Germany, it is virtually the BJP that has to carry the cross on this shameful episode. Prajwal's father, H.D. Revanna, has been arrested on charges of abduction of a woman to protect his son. An Interpol blue corner notice is set to be issued against the 33-year-old JD-S MP.\n\nThe Prajwal bomb has exploded at the most inopportune time for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah as the JD-S is virtually a non-player and it will be the BJP that will be in the dock for the company it keeps. Such are the wages of association, accidental or opportunistic.\n\nThe sex abuse case also punctured the PM's campaign on \"mangalsutra\" and the BJP's \"Nari Shakti\" boasts, with the Opposition questioning Mr Modi's silence on Prajwal, who has since been suspended from the JD-S.\n\nWhat is worse is that Opposition leaders are latching on to the case to target the PM, insisting that what Prajwal has committed is the biggest sex scandal in Independent India and accusing the PM of campaigning for the perpetrator of \"mass rape\". Nothing less than an apology from the PM will do, so goes the refrain.\n\nThe questions being asked by the Opposition are relevant. How can a PM who knows every foreign trip of an Opposition leader remain in the dark about Prajwal's plans of sudden departure abroad?\n\nWorse still, their refrain, right or wrong, is to ask why Mr Modi did not object to Prajwal's renomination. They wonder how he could have been ignorant of Prajwal's dubious past given the PM's alleged penchant for keeping a tab on every friend and foe.\n\nThe JD-S has been in the process of gradual extinction and no one in the democratic firmament will shed a tear for its predicament. For the BJP, the fear now is that Deve Gowda's party will pull it down in its most fertile state in the South.\n\nThe BJP and media outlets which treat it with kid gloves have gone out of their way to project that Prajwal has nothing to do with the party, clearly ignoring that he is an NDA candidate. Reports claimed that local BJP leaders had cautioned against Prajwal's candidature, warning the top leadership that he was a shady character and the party should keep its distance.\n\nFor the Opposition, the issue is a godsend in election season. One may recall how the BJP had exploited to the hilt the Nirbhaya affair in Delhi ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The tandoor murder case in Delhi in 1995 involving then Congress leader Sushil Sharma was used to target the grand old party ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.\n\nWhile the BJP would be much weary, the Prajwal case will bring focus on the less than fair treatment of women by the Modi establishment, be it the protests by Olympic women wrestlers, the Hathras incident or the Bilkis Bano case.\n\nIn the past, Mr Modi has benefited immensely from the sudden surfacing of CDs of the detractors of the then Gujarat CM. They made good use of selectively destroying the leaders from Opposition parties or within the BJP who acted against his interests.\n\nWith the expose of the Prajwal affair, the elections to the remaining 14 seats in Karnataka could be an added worry for the BJP. In faraway Uttar Pradesh, the BJP has been forced to deny renomination to the controversial Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who has been accused by the women wrestlers of sexual harassment, and nominate Brij Bhushan's son in his place.\n\nBesides, the worry for the top BJP leadership is that the Prajwal scandal will further aggravate the fissures in the state unit, with a section feeling that the B.S. Yediyurappa dynasty is being promoted.\n\nThe worry is that if the results are not good, the Modi-Shah duo would be targeted for going into an alliance with the JD-S by keeping the state unit in the dark. Former Union minister Sadananada Gowda, who was denied a Lok Sabha ticket this time, had claimed that even Mr Yediyurappa was not aware of the plan to align with the JD-S.\n\nThe Modi-Shah tactics and strategy in Karnataka are taking the party on a slippery slope. They forced Mr Yediyurappa out of the chief minister's post and brought in Basavaraj Bommai in his place as CM without much preparation. All the problems for the BJP in the South started from the Karnataka polls a year ago, where the controversial campaign by the PM fell flat due to bread and butter issues.\n\nStrange things are happening for the BJP in the South. In neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, TDP supremo N. Chandrababu Naidu's move to align with the BJP has helped chief minister and YSRCP leader Jagan Mohan Reddy to gain some ground.\n\nIn Congress-ruled Telangana, however, the decline in the BRS/TRS fortunes is now helping the BJP.\n\nIn Odisha, discussions of an alliance between the ruling BJD and the BJP led to so much dissensions in both parties that the situation is far from stabilised. The Congress, which has been in the cold for the past three decades, is sensing a feeble chance but still looks unprepared.\n\nReports say that in Madhya Pradesh, the sensational withdrawal of the nomination by Indore Congress candidate Akshay Kanti Bam is an \"explosive manifestation\" of the BJP's nervousness in the face of the unexpectedly low voting in the first two phases.\n\nIn Maharashtra, what is worrying the BJP is the sympathy factor for Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar, whose parties were split by it to gain power two years ago. The BJP's narrative that the state is witnessing a tussle between Mr Modi and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has not worked.\n\nIn Bihar, chief minister Nitish Kumar and his JD-U are becoming an acute source of trouble for the BJP amid growing signals that they are not fighting fit and are losing ground.\n\nIn the Northeast, the ethnic violence in BJP-ruled Manipur and its consistent neglect by the Centre, especially the PM, is casting a shadow over the entire region.\n\nAmid all this, Mr Modi's attacks on the Opposition, especially the Congress, are becoming louder. Much louder than that is his silence on the issues that have come to haunt the BJP.", "source": {"uri": "asianage.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Asian Age"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sunil_gatade@asianage.com", "name": "Sunil Gatade", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._D._Deve_Gowda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "H.

Photograph: ANI Photo\n\nModi told Times Now that the responsibility to take action in the raging matter lay with the state government as it was a law and order issue, according to the transcript of the interview provided by the broadcaster.\n\nHe said the presence of thousands of videos implies that it is of the time when the JD-S was in alliance with the Congress. These videos were gathered when they were in power and they released it during the elections after Vokkaligas exercised their franchise, he added.\n\nThe videos were released after he was sent out of the country, the prime minister said, calling the development very suspicious. If the state government had information, it should have kept a watch and there should have been vigil at the airport, he said.\n\n\"You did not do anything, the government of India was not informed. This means that it was a political game and they know that these videos were from the time they were in alliance and they accumulated these videos. However, this is not my issue, my issue is that any culprit should not be spared. These games should be stopped in our nation,\" he said, according to the transcript.\n\nHe added, \"As far as Modi is concerned, as far as the BJP is concerned, as far as our Constitution is concerned, I am of the clear view that there should be zero tolerance against such people. Stringent punishment should be given using all the legal options available.\"\n\nReplying to a question, he said, \"We should bring him back and strict action should be taken against him. There should be no ifs and buts.\"\n\nThe Congress and Janata Dal-Secular ran an alliance government in Karnataka after the 2018 polls and parted ways after fighting the 2019 Lok Sabha polls together.\n\nFormer prime minister HD Deve Gowda-led party entered into an alliance with the BJP in September last year and they are fighting the current Lok Sabha polls together.\n\nThe Congress has used the issue of Revanna's alleged sexual exploitation of a large number of women, captured in nearly 3000 video clips, to target the BJP.\n\nRevanna, Gowda's grandson, is again in the fray from Hassan, where polling was held on April 26. The regional party enjoys influence in south Karnataka, especially among Vokkaligas, the community Gowda belongs to.\n\nTo a poser about his charge against the Congress over issues like inheritance tax and redistribution of wealth, the prime minister said he has cited the language, words and written assurance of the party and its leaders to make his point.\n\n\"This time I have exposed them to the hilt. That is why they are rattled. When they go seeking votes of one community, they speak differently, and when they approach the other community, they take a neutral stand. This is their duplicity,\" he said.\n\nThis is unlike the BJP which always talked about building the Ram temple, abrogation of Article 370, and the Uniform Civil Code, he noted.\n\nOn the other hand, the Congress has been continuously lying while attacking the BJP by alleging that it intends to change the Constitution, he said, adding that some BJP members said something and the Congress blew it out of proportion.\n\n\"They are refusing to hear our version.

While JD(S) has a limited base in these constituencies and has not been allocated any seat in this region as part of its alliance, it does have pockets of support in Raichur, Kalaburagi and Vijayapura manifested in its past victories in Legislative Assembly elections in these districts. The Congress has pounced on the issue and has been highlighting the hypocrisy of the BJP with its focus on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's message, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (Save Women, Educate Women).\n\nAlso Read | 'Prajwal scandal has affected many families in Hassan': Banu Mushtaq\n\nPictures of Revanna alongside Modi have also been doing the rounds on social media as the Congress is making an aggressive attempt to critique Modi among his Lingayat supporters in the region. With Revanna's scandal, the Congress has also found a powerful issue to counter the BJP, which was fore-fronting the murder of Neha Hiremath by a jilted Muslim youth in Hubballi. A Congress leader, who was campaigning in rural Kalaburagi told Frontline that there was awareness of Revanna's scandal among voters, especially women. \"This is becoming an important issue that has come at the right time for the Congress. Wherever I go, even to the remotest village, people are aware that a crime has been committed. We already had an advantage with our five guarantees touching the lives of women. This will add to our support.\"\n\nTremendous disgust\n\nK. Neela, the Kalaburagi-based State vice president of the All India Democratic Women's Association, said that the JD(S) support base in Kalyana Karnataka (Hyderabad Karnataka) had already eroded even before the Revanna videos came to light. \"The JD(S) had a narrow support base in Kalyana Karnataka, primarily among Backward Castes and Muslims. These supporters and local-level leaders have been reluctant to campaign for the BJP candidates because the basis of their politics has been against the saffron party.\" She added, \"This is a feudal, backward part of the State, and when Revanna's videos went viral, there was tremendous disgust among people here so this will certainly affect the BJP's prospects.\"\n\nA similar sentiment was expressed by R. Khaatib, a Kalaburagi-based social activist who said that while \"Muslims and Dalits, who constitute a major chunk of the voters in Kalyana Karnataka, will vote against the BJP, Revanna's scandal may also impact BJP's traditional Lingayat voters who are a large part of the population here.\"\n\nBJP's massive margins\n\nA Belagavi-based English journalist with a prominent national broadsheet, who did not want to be named, said: \"The magnitude of Revanna's sexual crimes has meant that women voters of the area, including BJP's traditional supporters, will either vote against the BJP or will not vote at all.\" This could be a serious concern for the BJP as Modi enjoyed wide support among women across north Karnataka: this was evident in the massive margins of victory for the BJP in 2019 wherever women turnout was more than that of men.\n\nAlso Read | Karnataka's special investigative team to probe Prajwal Revanna case from three angles\n\nAnother Kannada-language journalist in Vijayapura went to the extent of saying that Revanna's crimes were \"the last nail in the coffin\" for the BJP in Bijapur and Bagalkot Lok Sabha seats. \"The women's wing of the Congress has campaigned effectively focussing on Revanna's sexual predatory behaviour, reaching rural hamlets as part of their door-to-door campaign. Even before the scandal came to light, there was a sentiment of anti-incumbency against the BJP candidates in these two constituencies. With Revanna's scandal becoming widely known, I highly doubt that the BJP will win here.\"\n\nM. Ahiraj, a Ballari-based senior journalist, however said that the issue did not seem to have a tremendous impact on the voters' mind. \"In Ballari at least, which is an ST reserved constituency, the issue is not being discussed widely. In fact, there were more protests after the murder of Neha Hiremath; but this was done by the BJP. Ballari is peculiar as no issue dominates the election narrative with both the BJP and Congress having an entrenched voter base. Since the JD(S) did not have a presence, it will not have any direct impact on the voters.\"", "source": {"uri": "frontline.thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Frontline"}, "authors": [],

They (Congress) are speaking all nonsense because they have lost all hope that they will not get even 3/4th seats in Karnataka.\" HD Revanna and his son, Prajwal Revanna are facing a probe by a Special Investigative Team (SIT), constituted by the Karnataka government, over allegations of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation following a complaint by a woman who worked in their household.\n\nHD Revanna is under Special Investigation Team (SIT) custody till May 8, while Prajwal Revanna has fled to another country. The BJP leader affirmed that his son BY Raghvendra, who is contesting from Shivamogga, will win by a margin of over 3 lakh votes.\n\n\"According to me, we are going to win 400 seats. In Karnataka, out of 28 seats minimum, we are going to win 25 seats. We are trying our level best in all 28 Lok Sabha constituencies. BY Raghavendra is going to win over 3 lakh votes margin,\" Yediyurappa said. \"Prime Minister has clarified that we are not going to touch the Constitution. Unnecessarily Congress is saying all these things...We need not discuss Rahul Gandhi's statements because they are not going to win even 50 seats in these Lok Sabha elections,\" he added.\n\nYediyurappa further said that all communities including SC and ST are supporting the BJP this time, because of the development work carried out by PM Modi-led BJP. \"Not only Vokkaligas, Lingayats, SC and ST all are supporting BJP because of PM Modi and the several development works that are being done,\" he stated.\n\nVoting for 28 Lok Sabha seats in Karnataka is being held in two phases. While 14 seats were polled on April 26, the remaining 14 will go to polling on May 7. The counting of votes is scheduled on June 4. In the 2019 elections, BJP almost swept the state by winning 25 out of 28 seats. While, Congress and JD-S -- who were in coalition in the state government -- could only win one seat each.

The three generations of the family of former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda are currently members of both the Houses of Parliament and the state legislature.\n\nAll three seats -- Hassan, Mandya, and Kolar -- contested by JDS went to polls in the second phase on April 26. Now, in the third phase, the BJP is in a direct contest with the Congress in 14 seats. BJP's alliance partner JDS is not a major force in those seats, although it has a presence in some pockets in North Karnataka.\n\nHours after voting in the second phase of polls in the seats in Vokkaliga-dominated Old Mysuru region, the scandal exploded into becoming a major topic of discussion in political circles across India. As the details of the horrendous crimes started coming out, Congress used it to attack the BJP by accusing it of turning a blind eye to atrocities on women. It became one of the electoral issues in their campaigning.\n\nThe Congress' no-holds-barred attack may have pre-empted the BJP's plans to aggressively use women's safety issues to attack the Congress government in the state. The BJP was going hammer-and-tongs against the Siddaramaiah government over law-and-order issues, especially Neha Hiremath's murder on the college campus in Hubballi.\n\nThe scandal involving its alliance candidate put the BJP on the backfoot to some extent, causing embarrassment to its top leaders. As a damage-control measure, JDS suspended Prajwal from the party and BJP turned the tables to question the State Government over delay in taking action against Prajwal as law and order is a state subject.\n\nWhile the issue remains a point of political discussion, it is unlikely to impact voters' decisions. The major factors in these elections include: the BJP's emphasis on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership and the Central Government's performance in the last 10 years, Congress' focus on its five guarantee schemes, promises made in its manifesto for the Lok Sabha polls, and its sustained campaign against the Centre over alleged discrimination against Karnataka.\n\nThe BJP, which in 2019 swept all 14 seats that will be going to the polls on May 7, will be banking on support from Lingayats as well as other communities to retain the seats. Congress is hoping to consolidate support from Dalits, backward classes, and minorities, while also trying to breach BJP's Lingayat fortress as it tries to improve its performance in North Karnataka. Determined to regain the lost ground, AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge has been spending considerable time in his home district Kalaburagi, while also campaigning vigorously in other states.", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ramu_patil@newindianexpress.com", "name": "Ramu Patil", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prajwal_Revanna", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prajwal Revanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janata_Dal_(Secular)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Janata Dal (Secular)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Lok_Sabha_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hassan Lok Sabha constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_information_report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First information report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._D._Deve_Gowda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "H.

Stringent punishment should be given using all the legal options available.\"\n\nReplying to a question, he said, \"We should bring him back and strict action should be taken against him. There should be no ifs and buts.\" The Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) ran an alliance government in Karnataka after the 2018 polls and parted ways after fighting the 2019 Lok Sabha polls together.\n\nFormer prime minister H D Deve Gowda-led party entered into an alliance with the BJP in September last year and they are fighting the current Lok Sabha polls together.\n\nThe Congress has used the issue of Revanna's alleged sexual exploitation of a large number of women, captured in nearly 3000 video clips, to target the BJP.\n\nRevanna, Gowda's grandson, is again in the fray from Hassan, where polling was held on April 26. The regional party enjoys influence in south Karnataka, especially among Vokkaligas, the community Gowda belongs to.\n\nTo a poser about his charge against the Congress over issues like inheritance tax and redistribution of wealth, the prime minister said he has cited the language, words and written assurance of the party and its leaders to make his point.\n\n\"This time I have exposed them to the hilt. That is why they are rattled. When they go seeking votes of one community, they speak differently, and when they approach the other community, they take a neutral stand. This is their duplicity,\" he said.\n\nThis is unlike the BJP which always talked about building the Ram temple, abrogation of Article 370, and the Uniform Civil Code, he noted.\n\nOn the other hand, the Congress has been continuously lying while attacking the BJP by alleging that it intends to change the Constitution, he said, adding that some BJP members said something and the Congress blew it out of proportion.\n\n\"They are refusing to hear our version. Now, the Congress asks where wealth distribution and inheritance tax are mentioned in its manifesto. The Congress shouldn't have double standards. The Congress will have to answer,\" PM Modi Modi said.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nExpanding his arguments against reservation based on religion, he said such an idea goes against the Constitution. Citing his government's welfare measures, PM Modi said he does not discriminate on the basis of religion.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vokkaliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vokkaliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janata_Dal_(Secular)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Janata Dal (Secular)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prajwal_Revanna", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prajwal Revanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Now", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Times Now"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Civil_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uniform Civil Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revocation_of_the_special_status_of_Jammu_and_Kashmir", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inheritance tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDTV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NDTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manifesto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-04/aalpoogo_pm-modi-ani-650_650x400_15_April_24.jpg?ver-20240430.08", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541174", "eventUri": "eng-9541174", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-26", "textStart": 2655, "textEnd": 2663}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

In Karnataka, out of 28 seats minimum, we are going to win 25 seats. We are trying our level best in all 28 Lok Sabha constituencies.

Unnecessarily Congress is saying all these things...We need not discuss Rahul Gandhi's statements because they are not going to win even 50 seats in these Lok Sabha elections,\" he added.\n\nYediyurappa further said that all communities including SC and ST are supporting the BJP this time, because of the development work carried out by PM Modi-led BJP.\n\n\"Not only Vokkaligas, Lingayats, SC and ST all are supporting BJP because of PM Modi and the several development works that are being done,\" he stated.\n\nVoting for 28 Lok Sabha seats in Karnataka is being held in two phases. While 14 seats were polled on April 26, the remaining 14 will go to polling on May 7. The counting of votes is scheduled on June 4.\n\nIn the 2019 elections, BJP almost swept the state by winning 25 out of 28 seats.

Deve Gowda escaping to Germany, it is virtually the BJP that has to carry the cross on this shameful episode. Prajwal's father, H.D. Revanna, has been arrested on charges of abduction of a woman to protect his son. An Interpol blue corner notice is set to be issued against the 33-year-old JD-S MP.\n\nThe Prajwal bomb has exploded at the most inopportune time for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah as the JD-S is virtually a non-player and it will be the BJP that will be in the dock for the company it keeps. Such are the wages of association, accidental or opportunistic.\n\nThe sex abuse case also punctured the PM's campaign on \"mangalsutra\" and the BJP's \"Nari Shakti\" boasts, with the Opposition questioning Mr Modi's silence on Prajwal, who has since been suspended from the JD-S.\n\nWhat is worse is that Opposition leaders are latching on to the case to target the PM, insisting that what Prajwal has committed is the biggest sex scandal in Independent India and accusing the PM of campaigning for the perpetrator of \"mass rape\". Nothing less than an apology from the PM will do, so goes the refrain.\n\nThe questions being asked by the Opposition are relevant. How can a PM who knows every foreign trip of an Opposition leader remain in the dark about Prajwal's plans of sudden departure abroad?\n\nWorse still, their refrain, right or wrong, is to ask why Mr Modi did not object to Prajwal's renomination. They wonder how he could have been ignorant of Prajwal's dubious past given the PM's alleged penchant for keeping a tab on every friend and foe.\n\nThe JD-S has been in the process of gradual extinction and no one in the democratic firmament will shed a tear for its predicament. For the BJP, the fear now is that Deve Gowda's party will pull it down in its most fertile state in the South.\n\nThe BJP and media outlets which treat it with kid gloves have gone out of their way to project that Prajwal has nothing to do with the party, clearly ignoring that he is an NDA candidate. Reports claimed that local BJP leaders had cautioned against Prajwal's candidature, warning the top leadership that he was a shady character and the party should keep its distance.\n\nFor the Opposition, the issue is a godsend in election season. One may recall how the BJP had exploited to the hilt the Nirbhaya affair in Delhi ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The tandoor murder case in Delhi in 1995 involving then Congress leader Sushil Sharma was used to target the grand old party ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.\n\nWhile the BJP would be much weary, the Prajwal case will bring focus on the less than fair treatment of women by the Modi establishment, be it the protests by Olympic women wrestlers, the Hathras incident or the Bilkis Bano case.\n\nIn the past, Mr Modi has benefited immensely from the sudden surfacing of CDs of the detractors of the then Gujarat CM. They made good use of selectively destroying the leaders from Opposition parties or within the BJP who acted against his interests.\n\nWith the expose of the Prajwal affair, the elections to the remaining 14 seats in Karnataka could be an added worry for the BJP. In faraway Uttar Pradesh, the BJP has been forced to deny renomination to the controversial Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who has been accused by the women wrestlers of sexual harassment, and nominate Brij Bhushan's son in his place.\n\nBesides, the worry for the top BJP leadership is that the Prajwal scandal will further aggravate the fissures in the state unit, with a section feeling that the B.S. Yediyurappa dynasty is being promoted.\n\nThe worry is that if the results are not good, the Modi-Shah duo would be targeted for going into an alliance with the JD-S by keeping the state unit in the dark. Former Union minister Sadananada Gowda, who was denied a Lok Sabha ticket this time, had claimed that even Mr Yediyurappa was not aware of the plan to align with the JD-S.\n\nThe Modi-Shah tactics and strategy in Karnataka are taking the party on a slippery slope. They forced Mr Yediyurappa out of the chief minister's post and brought in Basavaraj Bommai in his place as CM without much preparation. All the problems for the BJP in the South started from the Karnataka polls a year ago, where the controversial campaign by the PM fell flat due to bread and butter issues.\n\nStrange things are happening for the BJP in the South. In neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, TDP supremo N. Chandrababu Naidu's move to align with the BJP has helped chief minister and YSRCP leader Jagan Mohan Reddy to gain some ground.\n\nIn Congress-ruled Telangana, however, the decline in the BRS/TRS fortunes is now helping the BJP.\n\nIn Odisha, discussions of an alliance between the ruling BJD and the BJP led to so much dissensions in both parties that the situation is far from stabilised. The Congress, which has been in the cold for the past three decades, is sensing a feeble chance but still looks unprepared.\n\nReports say that in Madhya Pradesh, the sensational withdrawal of the nomination by Indore Congress candidate Akshay Kanti Bam is an \"explosive manifestation\" of the BJP's nervousness in the face of the unexpectedly low voting in the first two phases.\n\nIn Maharashtra, what is worrying the BJP is the sympathy factor for Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar, whose parties were split by it to gain power two years ago. The BJP's narrative that the state is witnessing a tussle between Mr Modi and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has not worked.\n\nIn Bihar, chief minister Nitish Kumar and his JD-U are becoming an acute source of trouble for the BJP amid growing signals that they are not fighting fit and are losing ground.\n\nIn the Northeast, the ethnic violence in BJP-ruled Manipur and its consistent neglect by the Centre, especially the PM, is casting a shadow over the entire region.\n\nAmid all this, Mr Modi's attacks on the Opposition, especially the Congress, are becoming louder.

He spoke to DH about the Neha Hiremath murder case, the Prajwal Revanna sex abuse case and the Muslim reservations in karnataka, among a range of issues. Edited excerpts:\n\nYou are looking at a fifth term and Dharwad has seen the murder of Neha Hiremath, the daughter of a Congress corporator. The Congress has accused the BJP of communalising the issue. How would you respond?\n\nI'm grateful for the people of Dharwad Lok Sabha for reposing their faith in me from the last four terms. As far as the murder of the college is concerned, Congress has always played the politics of appeasement and has encouraged communalism.\n\nThe Congress's accusation towards BJP is totally political; instead of accusing us, they should do self-introspection which they never do.\n\nWhether it is the blast in Rameshwaram Cafe or Neha's murder, the Congress government's response has been to paint a different picture. Congress is known for its soft approach on radical elements. They are more worried about their vote bank\n\n\u2060How do you think BJP will fare in Karnataka? Will it be able to manage the same amount of seats that it did in 2019?\n\nI am 100% confident that the BJP will do well. The people of Karnataka are aware of the Modi government's performance, and the work that has gone into making our country a powerful one.\n\n\u2060What according to you are the key issues on which the 2024 elections are being fought on?\n\nThis elections are about development of the country and welfare of four key sections of the society - garib (poor), yuva (youth), annadata (farmer) and nari shakti (women). This is an election that is fought between the tried, tested and trusted leadership of PM Modi and the confused alliance of the INDI parties which has neither leader, vision nor track record to show.\n\n\u2060There's this allegation by BJP against Congress on appeasement due to the Muslim reservation. But CM Jagan has also promised it in Andhra.\n\nAs far as the Congress is concerned, they have always favoured appeasement and vote bank politics at the cost of others. In Karnataka, they have said that entire populations of Muslims and Christians are backward, thereby denying the share of the communities that come under the ambit of the Other Backward Classes. Is that fair? They can no more hoodwink the people.\n\n\u2060In the Prajwal Revanna sexual harassment case, the Congress says that the BJP knew about the violations from before. How are you handling that accusation?\n\nThe situation now has to be handled by the state government - by the ruling Congress not the Opposition BJP. It has become the fashion for the shameless Congress party to fail on its front, and then point fingers at others.", "source": {"uri": "deccanherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deccan Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amrita_madhukalya@deccanherald.com", "name": "Amrita Madhukalya", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharwad", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dharwad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharwad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prajwal_Revanna", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prajwal Revanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Council_of_Ministers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union Council of Ministers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pralhad_Joshi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pralhad Joshi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reservation in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeasement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Appeasement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Votebank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Votebank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rameswaram", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rameswaram"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rameswaram"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christians"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State governments of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakti", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shakti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Backward_Class", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Other Backward Class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative_Lifestyles", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative Lifestyles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.deccanherald.com/deccanherald%2F2024-05%2Fb47f5450-597b-428d-919c-adad3126890a%2FPTI04_15_2024_000014A.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C2914%2C1530&w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541174", "eventUri": "eng-9541174", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

These videos were gathered when they were in power and they released it during the elections after Vokkaligas exercised their franchise, he added.\n\nThe videos were released after he was sent out of the country, the prime minister said, calling the development very suspicious. If the state government had information, it should have kept a watch and there should have been vigil at the airport, he said.\n\nAlso Read | Karnataka Lok Sabha Elections 2024: BJP, Congress Again Set for Battle in 14 Seats in State.\n\n\"You did not do anything, the government of India was not informed. This means that it was a political game and they know that these videos were from the time they were in alliance and they accumulated these videos. However, this is not my issue, my issue is that any culprit should not be spared. These games should be stopped in our nation,\" he said, according to the transcript.\n\nHe added, \"As far as Modi is concerned, as far as the BJP is concerned, as far as our Constitution is concerned, I am of the clear view that there should be zero tolerance against such people. Stringent punishment should be given using all the legal options available.\"\n\nReplying to a question, he said, \"We should bring him back and strict action should be taken against him. There should be no ifs and buts.\"\n\nThe Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) ran an alliance government in Karnataka after the 2018 polls and parted ways after fighting the 2019 Lok Sabha polls together.\n\nFormer prime minister H D Deve Gowda-led party entered into an alliance with the BJP in September last year and they are fighting the current Lok Sabha polls together.\n\nThe Congress has used the issue of Revanna's alleged sexual exploitation of a large number of women, captured in nearly 3000 video clips, to target the BJP.\n\nRevanna, Gowda's grandson, is again in the fray from Hassan, where polling was held on April 26. The regional party enjoys influence in south Karnataka, especially among Vokkaligas, the community Gowda belongs to.\n\nTo a poser about his charge against the Congress over issues like inheritance tax and redistribution of wealth, the prime minister said he has cited the language, words and written assurance of the party and its leaders to make his point.\n\n\"This time I have exposed them to the hilt. That is why they are rattled. When they go seeking votes of one community, they speak differently, and when they approach the other community, they take a neutral stand. This is their duplicity,\" he said.\n\nThis is unlike the BJP which always talked about building the Ram temple, abrogation of Article 370, and the Uniform Civil Code, he noted.\n\nOn the other hand, the Congress has been continuously lying while attacking the BJP by alleging that it intends to change the Constitution, he said, adding that some BJP members said something and the Congress blew it out of proportion.\n\n\"They are refusing to hear our version. Now, the Congress asks where wealth distribution and inheritance tax are mentioned in its manifesto. The Congress shouldn't have double standards. The Congress will have to answer,\" Modi said.\n\nExpanding his arguments against reservation based on religion, he said such an idea goes against the Constitution. Citing his government's welfare measures, Modi said he does not discriminate on the basis of religion.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [],

The party aims to build on its strong performance in the previous Lok Sabha elections, winning 25 of the state's 28 seats. Anything less than this would be seen as a setback. Achieving a similar or better result is crucial for the BJP to strengthen its position in the state and challenge the current Congress-led government.\n\nThe BJP's alliance with the JD(S), formalized in September of the previous year, involves the JD(S) contesting in three constituencies, leaving the remaining 25 for the BJP. This significant partnership aims to consolidate the BJP's foothold in a region facing stiff competition. The alliance is strategically important as it seeks to tap into the JD(S)'s strong local influence in parts of Karnataka, especially given the JD(S)'s lacklustre performance in the last Assembly elections.\n\nThe BJP and JD(S) collaboration is designed to merge their respective voter bases, critical in constituencies expected to see closely contested battles. However, this alliance has faced challenges, including concerns about the seamless transfer of votes between two parties with distinct political bases. Additionally, the JD(S)'s shift from a secular stance to partner with the BJP has been controversial and may alienate some of its traditional supporters.\n\nSocial engineering tactics underpin this strategic alliance between the BJP and JD(S). The BJP targets key caste groups like the Lingayats and Vokkaligas to bolster its electoral prospects. With Prime Minister Narendra Modi's continued popularity and the recent consecration of the Ayodhya Ram temple, the BJP is optimistic about replicating its previous electoral success in Karnataka.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janata_Dal_(Secular)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Janata Dal (Secular)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vokkaliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vokkaliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingayatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lingayatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayodhya", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ayodhya"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ayodhya"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2019/05/BMC_Election_2012_-_Ink_mark_after_voting_6886404209-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541174", "eventUri": "eng-9541174", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-26", "dateEnd": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 52, "textEnd": 70}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

The regional party enjoys influence in south Karnataka, especially among Vokkaligas, the community Gowda belongs to.\n\nTo a poser about his charge against the Congress over issues like inheritance tax and redistribution of wealth, the prime minister said he has cited the language, words and written assurance of the party and its leaders to make his point.\n\n\"This time I have exposed them to the hilt. That is why they are rattled. When they go seeking votes of one community, they speak differently, and when they approach the other community, they take a neutral stand. This is their duplicity,\" he said.\n\nThis is unlike the BJP which always talked about building the Ram temple, abrogation of Article 370, and the Uniform Civil Code, he noted.\n\nOn the other hand, the Congress has been continuously lying while attacking the BJP by alleging that it intends to change the Constitution, he said, adding that some BJP members said something and the Congress blew it out of proportion.\n\n\"They are refusing to hear our version. Now, the Congress asks where wealth distribution and inheritance tax are mentioned in its manifesto. The Congress shouldn't have double standards.

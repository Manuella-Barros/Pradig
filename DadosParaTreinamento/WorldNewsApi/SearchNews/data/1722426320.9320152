South Africa is eyeing their first ICC title in cricket history, while Rohit Sharma's India seeks to end an 11-year ICC title drought.It's hard to say who is more desperate to win. An ICC trophy has eluded India for 11 years, and they haven't won a T20 World Cup since the inaugural edition in 2007.

An ICC trophy would certainly be a fitting farewell for these stalwarts of Indian cricket.

{"id": 232079096, "title": "Trisha R. Thomas, \u2018Secret Keeper of Main Street,\u2019 on the books she loves", "text": "Trisha R. Thomas\u2019s debut novel, \u201cNappily Ever After,\u201d was an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work finalist and an Oprah Magazine Book That Made A Difference \u2013 and it was also adapted into a Netflix film starring Sanaa Lathan. Her latest novel, \u201cThe Secret Keeper of Main Street,\u201d is out this week. Ms. Thomas shares more about the book and her reading life in the Book Pages Q&A. Q: Would you tell readers a little about your book, please? When the son of a prominent family turns up dead, and the bride-to-be is arrested for murder, a dressmaker with second sight is at the center of the ensuing firestorm that threatens to overtake her and everyone she loves. As a dressmaker, Bailey hears things while she\u2019s pinning a bride. Secrets, hopes, dreams and sometimes regrets. She also has an uncanny ability to see beyond what she\u2019s told just by a graze of the bride\u2019s skin. She knows whether or not the bride is marrying her true love or if there\u2019s someone else out there who is her true soulmate. She knows more than she should and it eventually puts her in and her family in danger. Q: Your main character, like you, has experience making wedding gowns. What skills are required for someone to be successful doing this? Patience and lots of practice. Even when someone is very skilled, patience is required. There\u2019s no rushing in dressmaking. One little slip-up could cost the entire gown. Q: Is there a book or books you always recommend to other readers? I am a big reader. I probably read more books than I should because I could be writing. But I love to read. I\u2019ve recommended \u201cBig Magic\u201d by Elizabeth Gilbert more than any other book because most of the time, aspiring writers are asking me for advice on how to get started. I like this book because it\u2019s offering advice on how to be creative and not to give up on that creativity just because you\u2019re not feeling it or have gotten some negative feedback along the way. It\u2019s helped me so much over the last few years. Q: Do you remember the first book that made an impact on you? The first book that had an impact on me was when I was about six years old. My mother used to drop me off at the library for free babysitting (Sorry, mom!). I loved that library. It\u2019s still there, remodeled, in San Diego. I did a signing there for my very first published book, \u201cNappily Ever After.\u201d I couldn\u2019t wait to tell the librarians how much time I spent there as a little girl. I just loved \u201cLittle Witch\u201d by Anna Bennett. It was a big book for me at that age. Because I didn\u2019t have a library card, I had to keep reading it there. I\u2019d hide it so only I could find it. Q: Do you listen to audiobooks? If so, are there any titles or narrators you\u2019d recommend? I love audiobooks. I used to not. I was very particular about the voice in my ear. At first, I only liked British readers. Their lilt always sounded upbeat even when they were talking about murder and mayhem. I\u2019m open to other voices now. Q: What do you find the most appealing in a book: the plot, the language, the cover, a recommendation? Do you have any examples? I\u2019m usually attracted by the plot first and foremost. I\u2019m obsessed with taglines, always trying to make them for my own novels, so I look for that 30-second elevator pitch that intrigues you immediately. When you\u2019re trying to find an agent or pitch your book, the first sentence has to grab instantly. It\u2019s a skill to make one of those sentences and most people have no idea it took a whole year to write. An example: After 30 years of marriage, a woman takes a leap of faith and trades in her secure life for yearlong backpacking journey in the dangerous Appalachians. I haven\u2019t written that one yet, but I plan to. Q: What\u2019s something about your book that no one knows? I based a lot of the story on my own life as a bridal designer/dressmaker. I was a good listener and took so much of the energy home with me at night. I would lose a lot of sleep worried about some of my brides and their situations. For some reason, even to this day, people find it easy to tell me their stories. Q: If you could say something to your readers, what would it be? Thanks!

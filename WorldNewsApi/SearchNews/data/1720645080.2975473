The comedian, 33, who has cerebral palsy, has told how viewers sent her direct messages on Instagram after the show's new line-up was revealed last week, including one troll who accused her of \"ruining\" it and claimed the series would be rigged for her to win as \"it\u2019s the PC thing to do\". The official Taskmaster social media channels were also flooded with users criticising her addition, accusing her of being \"unwatchable\" and \"unfunny\", while others warned her involvement would ensure they skip the series to be aired later this year. Rosie admits she\u2019s suffered online abuse since turning comedy into a profession eight years ago, the taunts spiking following high-profile appearances on Channel 4\u2019s Big Fat Quiz of the Year and the Royal Variety Performance, which aired on Channel 4 and BBC1 last December. And in a new interview, Rosie - whose speech is slurred because of her condition as well as encountering mobility issues - admits the abuse has got so bad, it\u2019s seriously impacted her. Rosie says: 'More recently is it is hard, it is s**t at times. 'I wake up some days and I think it would be so much easier if I wasn\u2019t disabled, so don\u2019t look at me and go \"she\u2019s happy all the time\" because it takes a lot for me to keep on top of my own mental health.\u201d The Yorkshire comic says meeting one of her trolls during a documentary she recorded for Channel 4 called Rosie Jones: Am I A Retard? last July sparked her decision to initially seek therapy. She admitted she \"wanted to get violent\" when she came face-to-face with him after suffering a torrent of ableist abuse and admits she struggles beneath the surface of her cheery exterior. Speaking to tattooist and TV host Grace Neutral in the latest episode of her Under Your Skin series on YouTube, she explains: 'Doing that documentary took a toll on my mental health and I started therapy because of it, which I am so happy about. 'Financially it can be a problem, but I would say to anybody who can afford therapy to do it because your brain is the most important part of you and you don\u2019t need to wait until you\u2019re at rock bottom to check in on yourself. 'I even had a guy saying to me \"what? You\u2019re in therapy? You seem so happy?\" And I\u2019m like, it\u2019s not about whether I\u2019m crying in the street, also you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in my head but at the moment it is maintenance making sure that I approach my job and life and relationships as the best possible version of myself and I can do that because I\u2019m in therapy.' Rosie will be starring in the 18th series of Taskmaster alongside veteran comedian Jack Dee, I\u2019m A Celebrity\u2026 Get Me Out of Here! star Babtunde Aleshe, comedy actress Emma Sidi and funnyman Andy Zaltzman. The cult show, created and co-hosted by Alex Horne alongside the Taskmaster himself Greg Davies, sees the comics take on a series of daft challenges over 10 weeks. Rosie also received plenty of support from fans when the line-up was announced, some viewers believing her \"chaotic\" nature would make \"unmissable\" TV. The star says she turned to comedy when she was a youngster in a bid to stop people feeling sorry for her. She explains: 'I\u2019ve been doing comedy all my life because being different and having cerebral palsy meant that people felt sorry for me and I hated that because I felt like a victim or somebody that needed to be pitied. 'Literally, from being four-years-old I realised that if I told a joke people would say \"oh, she\u2019s ok\" she doesn\u2019t need people to feel sorry for her. 'So I was always the one in the family or at school telling jokes. But I was also the annoying one because I was not only the class clown but I was also very clever - so I did it all.' She was inspired to become a comic due to the lack of disabled figures on TV, believing she could become a trailblazer. And now Rosie hopes to use her profile to raise awareness of ableism - prejudice against people with disabilities - which she believes is not highlighted enough in society, and continue to hit back against the trolls. She says: 'I suffered in silence for a long time because every time I\u2019m on TV I\u2019ll get so much abuse on social media but I didn\u2019t want anyone to know because that made me feel like a couldn\u2019t cope. 'But then I thought that\u2019s all bulls*** and shouldn\u2019t have to stand for abuse just for being who I am.' Rosie added: 'I didn\u2019t know what ableism was until I was 28 and it\u2019s so damaging to be confronted by that level of discrimination every day and not really have a name for it and even now if you go in the street people know what racism, sexism and homophobia is, but they don\u2019t know what ableism is, so I thought I\u2019m going to change that and try to get that word out there more.", "summary": "The comedian, 33, has revealed abuse from trolls has driven her to therapy, days after she endured hurtful ableist comments for competing in Channel 4 series Taskmaster.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13506755/Rosie-Jones-therapy-taunts-trolls-taskmaster.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/07/18/85851087-0-image-a-25_1717781250221.jpg", "video": "https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2023/12/29/4153093274685624298/1024x576_MP4_4153093274685624298.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:29:13", "author": "Editor,Stuart Pink", "authors": ["Editor", "Stuart Pink"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.17}

A number of organisations in Banff hosted a visit from the Secretary-General of the British San Martin Institute, Mr Juan D\u00e1vila y Verdin. He made the trip from London in preparation for celebrations to take place later this summer. Monday, August 19 will be a noteworthy day in Banff, as it represents 200 years since the great South American statesman visited the town. General Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn (1778-1850) was the Liberator of Argentina, Chile and Peru. Together with Sim\u00f3n Bolivar (1783-1830) San Mart\u00edn was one of the main leaders of the successful struggle for independence in southern and central South America in the 19th century. The reason he came to Banff was at the invitation of his great friend, James 4th Earl Fife. The two had met, and become life-long friends, while both fighting for Spain against Napoleon in the early 19th century. General San Martin was given the Freedom of Banff during his visit in 1824, and this is remembered in Buenos Aires by a square being named after the town. His visit is remembered in Banff by both a Monkey Puzzle tree planted in Duff House woods in 1850 in his memory, and another 100 years later in Banff Castle grounds. Over the centuries there has been other contact between Banff and Argentina, including money for the poor of Banff being given by Eva Per\u00f3n. The Bicentenary will be noted on the day with a formal visit by a representative of the Argentine Embassy and other special guests, and with public events during Saturday, August 17 and Sunday, August 18. The planned public events include: \u2022 Exhibitions at The Museum of Banff (June 17 to the end of September) and at Duff House (August). \u2022 Additional stalls and events at The Vinery annual fete on Saturday, August 17. \u2022 Free maps and guided tours of \u201cBanff in 1824\u201d. \u2022A \u201cCelebration of planting the Monkey Puzzle\u201d with pipe and brass bands at Banff Castle on Sunday, August 18 from 1pm-3pm. Local organisations involved include Banff Preservation and Heritage Society and Museum of Banff; Friends of Duff House; Historic Environment Scotland; Banff Castle; Lord-Lieutenant of Banffshire; Banff Academy; The Vinery and Aberdeenshire Council.

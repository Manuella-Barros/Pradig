{"id": 243291484, "title": "Ibori Versus Obasanjo: Long Buried Truths Emerge, Slowly But Surely", "text": "\u201cWhen truth is buried under-ground it grows, it chokes, it gathers such an explosive force that on the day it bursts out, it blows up everything with it.\u201d \u2014 Emile Zola, 1898 No, the real explosions have yet to come. But what cannot be denied is that little by lit-tle, slight seepage by slight seepage, the truth concerning the onslaught, the political persecution proficiently, ardently, relentlessly, savagely and brutally directed against Chief James Onanefe Ibori but dressed up as an-ti-corruption prosecution, is emerg-ing. One such little seepage, an essay titled \u2018The Problem With EFCC,\u2019 ap-peared on June 25th, 2024, in The Ca-ble online newspaper. The author, Dr. Michael Owoko began the essay most energetically; \u201cIn every government or institution, there is a corresponding invisible hand that remote-controls its affairs with immense influence over the decision-making process, predom-inantly on matters of interest. In most cases, while the head, and perhaps, the kitchen cabinet, may be aware of this imperceptible parallel, it is mostly unknown to other members of the team, who ignorantly believe that the administration\u2019s decisions are with-out external interference. The Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) is a vic-tim of this invisible hand. The head of the commission, and possibly, his inner caucus, are not oblivious of its presence and interference, but may be unknown to other members of staff. By conferring the power to appoint the chairman of the commission on the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, lawmakers have unwit-tingly created an invisible hand for the EFCC. The invisible hand is the president, and by extension, the pres-idency\u201d. And with that, Dr. Owoko had raised the most relevant point in EFCC\u2019s persecution against Ibori. It all began in 2005 when the anti-graft agency was under Nuhu Ribadu\u2019s chairmanship and His Excellency, Olusegun Obasanjo was Nigeria\u2019s President. In 2007, Ibori\u2019s residency at the Asaba Government House ended as his two terms of four years each as Delta State Governor had been served. Dr. Omoko wrote: \u201cMost ex-gov-ernors, ministers and other political and business bigwigs that have been prosecuted and convicted to date are those with either weak links or fallen out of favour with the president. An example were former governors of Delta state, James Ibori, and Bayelsa state, Diepreye Alamieyeseigha (now late), whose demand for resource con-trol irked the then president, Gener-al Olusegun Obasanjo. The former president believed that the ex-gover-nors were source of funding for the defunct Niger Delta agitation group, the Movement for Emancipation of Niger Delta (MEND), and conse-quently activated the invisible hand which compelled the EFCC to cut them to size\u201d. Yes, the dictatorial Obasanjo who rated his personal opinion above the national constitution had refused to activate the 13% derivation payment to states on revenue emanating to the federation account from such states until Ibori convened a South-South summit in Asaba in 2000, 24 years ago. Also, by then the onshore and offshore dichotomy of natural gas and oil production was still being debated so Niger Delta states were being de-nied revenue accruing from mineral deposits in the Atlantic. In the man of that moment\u2019s thinking, revenue from such oil deposits belonged to Nigeria all right but not to the states which make up Nigeria. And I ask: Who was the President when Ibori and Alamieyeseigha faced such insidious persecution which highly regarded columnists such as Segun Adeniyi, Simeon Kolawole, Eugene Enahoro, Abraham Ogbodo and Chris Akor and Sahara Reporters hailed as untainted anti-corruption prosecution? Olusegun Obasanjo! Also, who was the EFCC Chairman? Nuhu Ribadu! As all the Aso Rock watchers knew, politics also ran through it; so, it was common knowledge that Obasanjo and EFCC targeted the Governors who were pro-Atiku Abubakar \u2013 Obasanjo\u2019s then estranged Vice-Pres-ident. Why would the President have such a control over the EFCC chairman? Omoko\u2019s answer: \u201cSection 2 (3) of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Establishment) Act, 2004 clearly states that \u201cthe chairman and members of the commission, oth-er than ex-officio members, shall be appointed by the president\u201d, and the appointment shall be subject to con-firmation by the Senate. By this Act, the EFCC was deliv-ered as a bondservant from incep-tion, lacking autonomy and courage to function effectively outside the grip and body language rhythm of its mas-ter, the president. And since the head of the commission occupies the driv-er\u2019s seat, obeying all traffic regulations as beamed by the president, liberty is replaced with dependency.\u201d Ordinarily, a President of a nation should be trusted to exercise power responsibly; that is why he is trust-ed with that authoritative office in the first place. He is not expected to abuse his office while hounding the citizens who dare disagree with him. But by the time the EFCC Bill was being debated, Obasanjo had already shown his true undem-ocratic colours and the National Assembly was wary of passing the EFCC Bill as he wanted it. To con-vince the national legislators that he meant well, Aso Rock offered to fly the relevant House of Representa-tives Committee to South Korea to study the anti-graft agency there. The evening before the Committee members embarked on that trip, I sat with a member, Hon Chude Ofodile to discuss the pros and cons of pass-ing the bill as Obasanjo wanted it, or to delay it further while the law makers tinker more with it. On the Committee\u2019s return from that trip, the bill was passed \u2013 and Nigeria fell into Obasanjo and Ribadu\u2019s control. Why did Michael Omoko focus on Ibori and Alamieyeseigha to illus-trate the factual happenings during Obasanjo\u2019s vindictive presidency, which set Nigeria on the free fall it is reeling from now? Ibori left office 17 years ago for goodness sake. He was even jailed in Britain, too, and so stayed away from Nigeria for almost a decade. Since then, the third set of Governors is now in office, yet Ibori remains an issue \u2013 nationwide. Since then, he has not held a public office. Yet, his popularity whether in Delta state or within the Niger Delta, has ever remained on the upward swing. This is perplexing. For an explanation, I align with Jacques Abbadie, later Dean of Killal-oe, Ireland. Abbadie said in 1684, in his French Treatise on the Truth of the Christian Religion: \u201cOne can fool some men, or fool all men in some places and times, but one cannot fool all men in all places and ages.\u201d The following century Denis Did-erot copied this almost verbatim in his entry in the Yale Book of Quotations, and it was later wrongly attributed to Lincoln; \u201cYou can fool some of the peo-ple all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time\u201d. There are no known contemporary records or accounts substantiating that Lin-coln ever made the statement. The earliest known appearance is Octo-ber 29, 1886 in the Milwaukee Daily Journal. It later appeared in the New York Times on August 26 and August 27, 1887. An exhaustive search of Lin-coln\u2019s writing and reported speeches has turned up nothing. Something I have chosen to call Ibori\u2019s revenge happened at Asaba during the May 31st 2024 funeral Mass for the late Asagba of Asaba, Prof. Chike Edozien, right inside the St. Jo-seph\u2019s Catholic Church, as related by Dr. Leroy C. Edozien: \u201cThe Priest was thanking the visitors, and according to the order of established protocol Ibori; the order of precedence. \u201cWhen it got to the turn of Chief James Onanefe Ibori, past Governor of Delta State, the congregation erupt-ed spontaneously in loud applause. Further down in his presentation, the priest had cause to again mention the name of Chief Ibori, and again there was a fervid applause in a hitherto quiet church. It was like we were at a political meeting or a celebrity par-ty, not a Catholic church. But these were not party loyalists or political acolytes, or tribesmen; they were or-dinary people who had come to their king\u2019s funeral\u201d. Also, Ibori was so honoured at Amassoma mid-June this year when he received a chieftaincy title, Opu Ekei of Igboin, from His Royal Maj-esty, King Oweipa Jones Ere III the Ebenanwei of Ogboin Kingdom title as he marked his 20th year as King. Vigorous applause greeted the Ibori name every time. Leroy Edozien asked an important question: \u201cHow come Chief Ibori re-ceived such a fervid and spontaneous reception (in church!) while the intro-duction of other top dignitaries met with silence? And this occurring 17 years after he left office? And despite adverse publicity that had trailed him for some time\u201d. He provides the answer: \u201cAs Governor, Chief Ibori worked his way into the hearts of the governed, across social strata. He was a man of the people. I recognise two do-mains in political leadership: \u2018soft\u2019 and \u2018hard\u2019. These two are distinct but they synergise and reinforce each other. The \u2018soft\u2019 domain is about relation-ships, about hearts and minds. A good leader reaches out to all, feels the pulse of the people, builds bridges, wins hearts and minds. The \u2018hard\u2019 domain is the tangible performance of the leader, as in the building of infrastruc-ture, creation of jobs, management of the economy and so on\u201d. The people score Ibori highly on both the hard and soft domains of power! Does Ibori\u2019s non-ebbing popular-ity matter? The important thing to his traducers, myopic though, is that he was jailed. If being imprisoned is all that matters, wasn\u2019t Obasanjo himself once imprisoned and later received presidential pardon? The ever resourceful Ibori made the best use of his time there; he studied for and earned university degrees there. The important thing to me is that truth is gradually emerging. The common Nigerians are not fools and so do not revere, and keep hailing someone, as their leader, come rain or shine for no reason. Niger Deltans know Ibori was jailed for his politics and not for steal-ing. Even journalists who excoriate him as a thief know they are lying; or they are plain bumbling fools and failed journalists for the London Court record bears witness that Ibori did not steal a penny from Delta state coffers. Truth: From No 82 (page 15) of Prosecution\u2019s statement during Ibori\u2019s sentencing comes this): \u201cMER Engi-neering built two houseboats, which were rented out to oil workers. It was Ibori who was able to influence the contracts with Chevron and Shell and the NNPC. 83: It was MER money that paid for the Ibori property in Hampstead, Westover Hill: COUNT 5: (lying on the file). 84: It was MER money that bought the house Ibori bought in Houston, Texas (USA). 85: It was MER money that paid for the deposit for the $20 million Challenger Jet airplane that Mr. Ibori was in the process of buying when his monies were restrained by the UK courts (Count 9) (STATEMENT OF OFFENCE reads: \u201cAttempting to commit money laundering contrary to Section 1 (1) of the Criminal At-tempts Act 1981\u201d. Finish. The partic-ulars of offence section were among the dropped charges. Doubtlessly, all the properties were actually bought with monies that ac-crued from MER Engineering, Ibori\u2019s own company on contract with cer-tain oil majors. 183: \u201cMER had a bank account at Barclays in Knightsbridge. The money went from the oil companies straight out of Nigeria and into MER account in Barclays\u201d. 140: Prosecution\u2019s conclusion: \u201cTo recap, during the eight-year period, when James Ibori was Governor of Delta State, ostensibly earning 4 thou-sand Pounds per annum, he amassed a property portfolio of six houses worth 6.9 million Pounds\u201d. Was Ibori really earning just Four Thousand Pounds yearly? Who owned MER Engineering and such other businesses? And why did the London Prosecution mention only 6.9 million Pounds? What happened to the $200 million dollars charge Obasanjo said in the Chude Jideonwo interview and his My Watch book that he or EFFCC had established against Ibori and he asked Ibori to refund some $150m. Lies have short legs. Phew! Nigerians couldn\u2019t ask where Obasanjo derived such powers from. Yet, they claim to love freedom and swear by the constitution.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"538\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Ibori-and-Obasanjo.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Ibori-and-Obasanjo.jpg 538w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Ibori-and-Obasanjo-300x195.jpg 300w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Ibori-and-Obasanjo-210x136.jpg 210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px\" /></div>\u201cWhen truth is buried under\u00adground it grows, it chokes, it gathers such an explosive force that on the day it bursts out, it blows up everything with it.\u201d &#160;\u2014 Emile Zola, 1898 No, the real explosions have yet to come.

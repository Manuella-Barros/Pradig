The hoarding, which included festive lights at Nagathamman and Selliyamman temples in Kuruvimalai, went viral due to Khalifa's image appearing alongside the deities.\n\nThe image of Mia Khalifa was altered to show her carrying a 'paal kudam' (milk vessel), a traditional offering in the festival dedicated to Shakti or divine energy, according to a report on India Today. This incident has caused a stir among festival attendees and social media users alike.\n\nThe 'Aadi' festival, celebrated across Tamil Nadu is dedicated to Goddess Amman (Parvathi) and involves grand festivities in each village with thousands participating over several days. In Tamil Nadu, the monsoon season typically starts in the month of Aadi, leading to a rise in the water levels of the rivers. As a result, 'Aadi Perukku' is celebrated to thank the waterbodies.\n\nThe inclusion of Khalifa's image has raised questions about the oversight and authenticity of the festival's promotional materials. The individuals responsible for the hoarding had included their contact details in the form of Aadhaar cards, further drawing attention to the incident.\n\nMia Khalifa, in previous interviews, has discussed her brief stint in the adult film industry and the challenges she faced afterward. In a 2016 interview with The Washington Post, she explained that she performed in pornography for only three months and had left the industry to pursue a more conventional career. Despite her departure, the label continued to follow her.\n\nIn an earlier interview with the BBC, Mia explained that her inexperience led her into the industry, and even after she eventually quit, the label continued to follow her.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mia_Khalifa", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mia Khalifa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_calendar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tamil calendar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanchipuram_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kanchipuram district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kanchipuram district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvati", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parvati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakti", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shakti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monsoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aadhaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aadhaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aadi_Perukku", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aadi Perukku"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Conferences_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Conferences and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/08/08/dd6c4be8db7e279f24366afd7434139e1723111367464240_original.jpg?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801281", "eventUri": "eng-9801281", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

The hoarding showed a provocative picture of Khalifa holding a traditional milk vessel that is otherwise used to offer at Goddess Amman during the festival as 'paal kudam.'.\n\nCelebrating Shakti in Tamil Nadu\n\nAadi Perukku is celebrated as the penultimate celebration across Tamil Nadu, aimed at worshipping Shakti in feminine energy. It encompasses elaborate ceremonies, and each temple in this region rises to the challenge. These festivals are a kaleidoscope of color with beautiful decorations, crowds, and festivities -- gutti- and series-light-decorated hoardings across all prominent temples like Nagathamman and Selliyamman in Kuruvimalai.\n\nHowever, the image of Mia Khalifa on the hoarding was controversy enough. Her image was morphed in keeping with the theme of the festival and placed it alongside images of deities, which evoked fierce criticism from protesters at the festival venue and social media users. Critics argue that this use of Khalifa's image is disrespectful and incongruous to the sacred traditions associated with the festival.\n\nA Celebration of Shakti and Tradition\n\nThe uproar elicited quick action for the removal of the hoarding by the Magaral Police Station. It also brought out the sensitiveness involved in blending modern elements with traditional celebrations and possible missteps that could offend cultural and religious sentiments.\n\nThis simply underscores the importance of careful consideration and respect for cultural practices in festivals with strong religious and traditional values. The festival was known to be a symbol of unity and devotion, but an unexpected distraction disrupted the harmony, reminding organizers of the importance of promotional material that aligns with the ethos of the celebration.", "source": {"uri": "dnpindia.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNP INDIA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sparsh_goel@dnpindia.in", "name": "Sparsh Goel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mia_Khalifa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mia Khalifa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aadi_Perukku", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aadi Perukku"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakti", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shakti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Film_Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Film Festivals", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Festivals", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Conferences_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Conferences and Events", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Festivals", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Festivals", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.dnpindia.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Viral-Video-95.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801281", "eventUri": "eng-9801281", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

In this sacred space, I'm surrounded by portraits of extraordinary American presidents. Thomas Jefferson wrote the immortal words that guide this nation. George Washington, who showed us presidents are not kings. Abraham Lincoln, who implored us to reject malice. Franklin Roosevelt, who inspired us to reject fear.\n\nI revere this office, but I love my country more.\n\nIt's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it's more important than any title.\n\nI draw strength and I find joy in working for the American people, but this sacred task of perfecting our union is not about me. It's about you, your families, your futures. It's about we the people, and we can never forget that. And I never have.\n\nI've made it clear that I believe America is at an inflection point, one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now will determine our fate of our nation and the world for decades to come.\n\nAmerica is going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division. We have to decide, do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy? In this moment, we can see those we disagree with not as enemies, but as fellow Americans. Can we do that? Does character in public life still matter?\n\nI believe you know the answer to these questions because I know you, the American people, and I know this, we are a great nation because we are a good people.\n\nWhen you elected me to this office, I promised to always level with you, to tell you the truth. And the truth, the sacred cause of this country, is larger than any one of us, and those of us who cherish that cause cherish it so much, a cause of American democracy itself must unite to protect it.\n\nYou know, in recent weeks it's become clear to me that I needed to unite my party in this critical endeavor. I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future all merited a second term, but nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy, and that includes personal ambition.\n\nSo I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That's the best way to unite our nation. I know there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life, but there's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices, and that time and place is now.\n\nOver the next six months, I'll be focused on doing my job as president. That means I'll continue to lower costs for hard-working families, grow our economy. I'll keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose. I'll keep calling out hate and extremism, make it clear there is no place, no place in America for political violence or any violence ever, period. I'm going to keep speaking out to protect our kids from gun violence, our planet from climate crisis, is the existential threat.\n\nAnd I will keep fighting for my for my cancer moonshot, so we can end cancer as we know it because we can do it. And I'm going to call for Supreme Court reform because this is critical to our democracy, Supreme Court reform. You know, I will keep working to ensure America remains strong and secure and the leader of the free world.\n\nI'm the first president in this century to report to the American people that the United States is not at war anywhere in the world. We'll keep rallying a coalition of proud nations to stop Putin from taking over Ukraine and doing more damage. We'll keep NATO stronger, and I'll make it more powerful and more united than at any time in all of our history. I'll keep doing the same for allies in the Pacific.\n\nYou know, when I came to office, the conventional wisdom was that China would inevitably surpass the United States. That's not the case anymore. And I'm going to keep working to end the war in Gaza, bring home all the hostages and bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war.\n\nWe're also working around the clock to bring home Americans being unjustly detained all around the world. You know, we've come so far since my inauguration. On that day, I told you as I stood in that winter -- we stood in a winter of peril and a winter of possibilities, peril and possibilities. We were in the grip of the worst pandemic in the century, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War, but we came together as Americans, and we got through it. We emerged stronger, more prosperous and more secure.\n\nToday, we have the strongest economy in the world, creating nearly 16 million new jobs -- a record. Wages are up, inflation continues to come down, the racial wealth gap is the lowest it's been in 20 years. We're literally rebuilding our entire nation, urban, suburban, rural and tribal communities. Manufacturing has come back to America.\n\nWe're leading the world again in chips and science and innovation. We finally beat Big Pharma after all these years, to lower the cost of prescription drugs for seniors, and I'm going to keep fighting to make sure we lower the cost for everyone, not just seniors.\n\nMore people have health care today in America than ever before. And I signed one of the most significant laws helping millions of veterans and their families who were exposed to toxic materials. You know, the most significant climate law ever, ever in the history of the world, the first major gun safety law in 30 years. And today, violent crime rate is at a 50-year low.\n\nWe're also securing our border. Border crossings are lower today than when the previous administration left office. And I've kept my commitment to appoint the first Black woman to the Supreme Court of the United States of America. I also kept my commitment to have an administration that looks like America and be a president for all Americans.\n\nThat's what I've done. I ran for president four years ago because I believed, and still do, that the soul of America was at stake. The very nature of who we are was at stake and that's still the case. America is an idea, an idea stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant.\n\nIt's the most powerful idea in the history of the world. That idea is that we hold these truths to be self-evident. We're all created equal, endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights, life, liberty, pursuit of happiness. We've never fully lived up to it, to this sacred idea, but we've never walked away from it either and I do not believe the American people will walk away from it now.\n\nIn just a few months, the American people will choose the course of America's future. I made my choice. I made my views known. I would like to thank our great Vice President Kamala Harris. She's experienced, she's tough, she's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country. Now the choice is up to you, the American people.\n\nWhen you make that choice, remember the words of Benjamin Franklin. It's hanging on my wall here in the Oval Office, alongside the bust of Dr. King and Rosa Parks and Cesar Chavez. When Ben Franklin was asked as he emerged from the convention going on, whether the founders have given America a monarchy or republic, Franklin's response was \"a republic, if you can keep it.\" A republic if you can keep it. Whether we keep our republic is now in your hands.\n\nMy fellow Americans, it's been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years. Nowhere else on earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as President of the United States, but here I am. That's what's so special about America.\n\nWe are a nation of promise and possibilities, of dreamers and doers, of ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things. I've given my heart and my soul to our nation, like so many others. I've been blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people. I hope you have some idea how grateful I am to all of you.\n\nThe great thing about America is here kings and dictators do not rule, the people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands. We just have to keep faith, keep the faith and remember who we are. We're the United States of America and there's simply nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together.\n\nSo let's act together, preserve our democracy. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you.", "source": {"uri": "mynorthwest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My Northwest"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@mynorthwest.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolute_desk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Resolute desk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abraham Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

We will keep rallying a coalition of proud nations to stop Putin from taking over Ukraine and doing more damage. We'll keep NATO stronger, and I will make it more powerful and more united than any time in all of our history. I will keep doing the same for our allies in the Pacific. You know, when I came to the office, the conventional wisdom was that China would inevitably pass, surpass the United States.\n\nThat's not the case anymore. And I'm going to keep working to end the war in Gaza, bring home all the hostages and bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war. We are also working around the clock to bring home Americans being unjustly detained all around the world.\n\nYou know, we've come so far since my inauguration. On that day, I told you as I stood in that winter -- we are stood in a winter of peril and winter of possibilities. Peril and possibilities. We are in the group of, we were in the group of the worse pandemic in the century. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. We came together as Americans. We got through it. We emerged stronger, more prosperous and more secure.\n\nToday we have the strongest economy in the world, creating nearly 16 million new jobs -- a record. Wages are up, inflation continues to come down, the racial wealth gap is the lowest it's been in 20 years. We are literally rebuilding our entire nation -- urban, suburban and rural and tribal communities. Manufacturing has come back to America. We are leading the world again in chips and science and innovation. We finally beat Big Pharma after all these years to lower the cost of prescription drugs for seniors.\n\nAnd I'm going to keep fighting to make sure we lower the cost for everyone, not just seniors. More people have health care today in America than ever before. I signed one of the most significant laws helping millions of veterans and their families who were exposed to toxic materials. You know, most significant climate law ever, ever in the history of the world. The first major gun safety law in 30 years.\n\nAnd today, the violent crime rate is at a 50-year low. We are also securing our border. Border crossings are lower today than when the previous administration left office. I've kept my commitment to appoint the first Black woman to the Supreme Court of the United States of America. I also kept my commitment to have an administration that looks like America and be a president for all Americans. That's what I've done.\n\nI ran for president four years ago because I believed and still do that the soul of America was at stake. The very nature of who we are was at stake. That is still the case. America is an idea. An idea stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant. It's the most powerful idea in the history of the world. That idea is that we hold these truths to be self-evident.\n\nWe are all created equal, endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights: life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. We've never fully lived up to it -- to this sacred idea -- but we've never walked away from it either. And I do not believe the American people will walk away from it now.\n\nIn just a few months, the American people will choose the course of America's future. I made my choice. I've made my views known. I would like to thank our great vice president, Kamala Harris. She is experienced, she is tough, she is capable. She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country.\n\nNow the choice is up to you, the American people. When you make that choice, remember the words of Benjamin Franklin hanging on my wall here in the Oval Office, alongside the busts of Dr. King and Rosa Parks and Cesar Chavez.\n\nWhen Ben Franklin was asked, as he emerged from the convention going on, whether the founders have given America a monarchy or a republic, Franklin's response was: \"A republic, if you can keep it.\" A republic, if you can keep it. Whether we keep our republic is now in your hands. My fellow Americans, it's been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years.\n\nNowhere else on Earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pa., and in Claymont, Del., one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as the president of the United States, but here I am.\n\nThat's what's so special about America. We are a nation of promise and possibilities. Of dreamers and doers. Of ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things. I've given my heart and my soul to our nation, like so many others. And I've been blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people. I hope you have some idea how grateful I am to all of you.\n\nThe great thing about America is, here kings and dictators do not rule -- the people do. History is in your hands. The power's in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands. You just have to keep faith -- keep the faith -- and remember who we are. We are the United States of America, and there are simply nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. So let's act together, preserve our democracy. God bless you all and may God protect our troops.

It is about 'we, the people,\" he added.\n\n\"We are a great nation because we are good people. When you elected me to this office, I promised to always level with you, to tell you the truth. The truth, the sacred cause of this country, is larger than any one of us,\" he said. \"We must unite to protect it.\"\n\nBiden further noted that now, in just a few months, the Americans will choose the course of America's future.\n\nHe also championed his vice president, who's now taking his place on the ticket, and said that he has made his choice and has made his views known.\n\nCalling the US Vice President tough and capable, Biden said, \"I would like to thank our great vice president, Kamala Harris.

We do it together,\" he said.\n\nFurther, Biden also highlighted that over the next six months, he will be focused on his job as US President.\n\n\"Over the next six months, I will be focused on doing my job as president. That means I will continue to lower costs for hard-working families and grow our economy. I will keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose.\"\n\nThe US presidential election will take place on November 5, and Biden is seeking re-election to the post as the Democratic Party nominee. After his June 27 debate with Republican candidate Donald Trump, Democrats put pressure on him to withdraw from the race.\n\nFollowing this, on July 21, Biden formally announced that he was abandoning plans for a second term in office and endorsed his running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris for the election.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris has quickly consolidated support among Democrats and has already secured the backing of enough delegates to be the likely Democratic nominee.

And he told voters, \"History is in your hands.\"\n\nPresident Biden delivered remarks from the Oval Office on Wednesday on his decision to abandon his bid for re-election. The following is a transcript of his speech, as recorded by The New York Times.\n\nMy fellow Americans, I'm speaking to you tonight from behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. In this sacred space, I'm surrounded by portraits of extraordinary American presidents. Thomas Jefferson wrote the immortal words that guide this nation. George Washington showed us presidents are not kings. Abraham Lincoln implored us to reject malice. Franklin Roosevelt inspired us to reject fear.\n\nI revere this office, but I love my country more. It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it's more important than any title. I draw strength and find joy in working for the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our union is not about me, it's about you. Your families, your futures.\n\nIt's about we the people. And we can never forget that. And I never have. I've made it clear that I believe America is at an inflection point. On those rare moments in history, when the decisions we make now determine our fate of our nation and the world for decades to come, America is going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division.\n\nWe have to decide: Do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy. In this moment, we can see those we disagree with not as enemies but as, I mean, fellow Americans -- can we do that? Does character in public life still matter? I believe you know the answer to these questions because I know you the American people, and I know this:\n\nWe are a great nation because we are a good people. When you elected me to this office, I promised to always level with you, to tell you the truth. And the truth, the sacred cause of this country, is larger than any one of us. Those of us who cherry that cause cherish it so much. The cause of American democracy itself. We must unite to protect it.\n\nIn recent weeks, it has become clear to me that I need to unite my party in this critical endeavor. I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future, all merited a second term. But nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition.\n\nSo I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It's the best way to unite our nation. I know there was a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. There's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now.\n\nOver the next six months, I will be focused on doing my job as president. That means I will continue to lower costs for hard-working families, grow our economy. I will keep defending our personal freedoms and civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose. I will keep calling out hate and extremism, making it clear there is no place, no place in America for political violence or any violence ever, period. I'm going to keep speaking out to protect our kids from gun violence, our planet from climate crisis as an existential threat.\n\nI will keep fighting for my Cancer Moonshot, so we can end cancer as we know it because we can do it. I'm going to call for Supreme Court reform because this is critical to our democracy -- Supreme Court reform. You know, I will keep working to ensure American remains strong, secure and the leader of the free world.\n\nI'm the first president of this century to report to the American people that the United States is not at war anywhere in the world. We will keep rallying a coalition of proud nations to stop Putin from taking over Ukraine and doing more damage. We'll keep NATO stronger, and I will make it more powerful and more united than any time in all of our history. I will keep doing the same for our allies in the Pacific. You know, when I came to the office, the conventional wisdom was that China would inevitably pass, surpass the United States.\n\nThat's not the case anymore. And I'm going to keep working to end the war in Gaza, bring home all the hostages and bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war. We are also working around the clock to bring home Americans being unjustly detained all around the world.\n\nYou know, we've come so far since my inauguration. On that day, I told you as I stood in that winter -- we are stood in a winter of peril and winter of possibilities. Peril and possibilities. We are in the group of, we were in the group of the worse pandemic in the century. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. We came together as Americans. We got through it. We emerged stronger, more prosperous and more secure.\n\nToday we have the strongest economy in the world, creating nearly 16 million new jobs -- a record. Wages are up, inflation continues to come down, the racial wealth gap is the lowest it's been in 20 years. We are literally rebuilding our entire nation -- urban, suburban and rural and tribal communities. Manufacturing has come back to America. We are leading the world again in chips and science and innovation. We finally beat Big Pharma after all these years to lower the cost of prescription drugs for seniors.\n\nAnd I'm going to keep fighting to make sure we lower the cost for everyone, not just seniors. More people have health care today in America than ever before. I signed one of the most significant laws helping millions of veterans and their families who were exposed to toxic materials. You know, most significant climate law ever, ever in the history of the world. The first major gun safety law in 30 years.\n\nAnd today, the violent crime rate is at a 50-year low. We are also securing our border. Border crossings are lower today than when the previous administration left office. I've kept my commitment to appoint the first Black woman to the Supreme Court of the United States of America. I also kept my commitment to have an administration that looks like America and be a president for all Americans. That's what I've done.\n\nI ran for president four years ago because I believed and still do that the soul of America was at stake. The very nature of who we are was at stake. That is still the case. America is an idea. An idea stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant. It's the most powerful idea in the history of the world. That idea is that we hold these truths to be self-evident.\n\nWe are all created equal, endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights: life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. We've never fully lived up to it -- to this sacred idea -- but we've never walked away from it either. And I do not believe the American people will walk away from it now.\n\nIn just a few months, the American people will choose the course of America's future. I made my choice. I've made my views known. I would like to thank our great vice president, Kamala Harris. She is experienced, she is tough, she is capable. She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country.\n\nNow the choice is up to you, the American people. When you make that choice, remember the words of Benjamin Franklin hanging on my wall here in the Oval Office, alongside the busts of Dr. King and Rosa Parks and Cesar Chavez.\n\nWhen Ben Franklin was asked, as he emerged from the convention going on, whether the founders have given America a monarchy or a republic, Franklin's response was: \"A republic, if you can keep it.\" A republic, if you can keep it. Whether we keep our republic is now in your hands. My fellow Americans, it's been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years.\n\nNowhere else on Earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pa., and in Claymont, Del., one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as the president of the United States, but here I am.\n\nThat's what's so special about America. We are a nation of promise and possibilities. Of dreamers and doers. Of ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things. I've given my heart and my soul to our nation, like so many others. And I've been blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people. I hope you have some idea how grateful I am to all of you.\n\nThe great thing about America is, here kings and dictators do not rule -- the people do. History is in your hands. The power's in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands. You just have to keep faith -- keep the faith -- and remember who we are. We are the United States of America, and there are simply nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. So let's act together, preserve our democracy. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oval", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Oval"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolute_desk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Resolute desk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abraham Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

In this sacred space, I'm surrounded by portraits of extraordinary American presidents. Thomas Jefferson wrote the immortal words that guide this nation.\n\nGeorge Washington showed us presidents are not kings. Abraham Lincoln, who implored us to reject malice. Franklin Roosevelt, who inspired us to reject fear.\n\nI revere this office, but I love my country more. It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it's more important than any title.\n\nI draw strength and I find joy in working for the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our union, it's not about me. It's about you, your families, your futures.\n\nIt's about we, the people. We can never forget that. And I never have.\n\nI've made it clear that I believe America is at an inflection point. One of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now determine our fate of our nation and the world for decades to come. America is going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division.\n\nWe have to decide, do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice, and democracy? In this moment, we can see those we disagree with not as enemies, but as fellow Americans. Can we do that? Does character and public life still matter? I believe I know the answer to these questions, because I know you, the American people. And I know this, we are a great nation because we are good people.\n\nWhen you elected me to this office, I promised to always level with you, to tell you the truth. The truth, the sacred cause of this country is larger than any one of us. Those of us who cherish that cause, cherish it so much, a cause of American democracy itself, must unite to protect it.\n\nYou know, in recent weeks, it's become clear to me that I need to unite my party in this critical endeavor. I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future, all merited a second term. But nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy.\n\nThat includes personal ambition. So I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It's the best way to unite our nation.\n\nYou know, there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. There's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now.\n\nOver the next six months, I'll be focused on doing my job as president. That means I'll continue to lower costs for hardworking families, grow our economy. I'll keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose.\n\nI'll keep calling out hate and extremism, making clear there is no place, no place in America for political violence or any violence ever, period. I'm going to keep speaking out to protect our kids from gun violence, our planet from climate crisis that is the existential threat. And I will keep fighting for my cancer moonshot so we can end cancer as we know it, because we can do it.\n\nI'm going to call for Supreme Court reform, because this is critical to our democracy, Supreme Court reform. You know, I'll keep working to ensure America remains strong, secure, and the leader of the free world. I'm the first president in this century to report to the American people that the United States is not at war anywhere in the world.\n\nWe'll keep rallying a coalition of proud nations to stop Putin from taking over Ukraine, doing more damage. We'll keep NATO stronger, and I'll make it more powerful and more united than any time in all of our history. I'll keep doing the same for allies in the Pacific.\n\nYou know, when I came to office, the conventional wisdom was that China would inevitably surpass the United States. That's not the case anymore. And I'm going to keep working to end the war in Gaza, bring home all the hostages, and bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war.\n\nWe're also working around the clock to bring home Americans being unjustly detained all around the world. You know, we've come so far since my inauguration. On that day, I told you as I stood in that winter, we're stood in a winter of peril and winter of possibilities, peril of possibilities.\n\nWe're in the grip of the world. We were in the grip of the worst pandemic in the century, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. But we came together as Americans.\n\nWe got through it. We emerged stronger, more prosperous, and more secure. Today, we have the strongest economy in the world, creating nearly 16 million new jobs a record.\n\nWages are up. Inflation continues to come down. The racial wealth gap is the lowest it's been in 20 years.\n\nWe're literally rebuilding our entire nation, urban, suburban, rural, tribal communities. Manufacturing has come back to America. We're leading the world again in chips and science and innovation.\n\nWe finally beat Big Pharma after all these years to lower the cost of prescription drugs for seniors. And I'm going to keep fighting to make sure we lower the cost for everyone, not just seniors. More people have health care today in America than ever before.\n\nAnd I signed one of the most significant laws helping millions of veterans and their families who are exposed to toxic materials. You know, most significant climate law ever, ever in the history of the world. The first major gun safety law in 30 years.\n\nToday, the violent crime rate is at a 50-year low. We're also securing our border. Border crossings are lower today than when the previous administration left office.\n\nI've kept my commitment to appoint the first Black woman to the Supreme Court of the United States of America. I also kept my commitment to have an administration that looks like America and be a president for all Americans. That's what I've done.\n\nI ran for president four years ago because I believed and still do that the soul of America was at stake. The very nature of who we are was at stake. And that's still the case.\n\nAmerica is an idea, an idea stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant. It's the most powerful idea in the history of the world. That idea is that we hold these truths to be self-evident.\n\nWe're all created equal. Endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights, life, liberty, pursuit of happiness. We've never fully lived up to it, to this sacred idea, but we've never walked away from it either.\n\nAnd I do not believe the American people will walk away from it now. Just a few months, the American people will choose the course of America's future. I made my choice.\n\nI made my views known. I'd like to thank our great Vice President Kamala Harris. She's experienced, she's tough, she's capable.\n\nShe's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country. Now the choice is up to you, the American people. When you make that choice, remember the words of Benjamin Franklin hanging on my wall here in the Oval Office alongside the busts of Dr. King and Rosa Parks and Cesar Chavez.\n\nWhen Ben Franklin was asked, as he emerged from the convention going on, whether the founders have given America a monarchy or republic, Franklin's response was, a republic, if you can keep it. A republic, if you can keep it. Whether we keep our republic is now in your hands.\n\nMy fellow Americans, it's been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years. Nowhere else on earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Claremont, Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as President of the United States. But here I am.\n\nThat's what's so special about America. We're a nation of promise and possibilities, of dreamers and doers, of ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things. I've given my heart and my soul to our nation, like so many others.\n\nI've been blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people. I hope you have some idea how grateful I am to all of you. The great thing about America is here kings and dictators do not rule, the people do.\n\nHistory is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands.\n\nWe just have to keep faith, keep the faith. And remember who we are. We're the United States of America.\n\nAnd there's simply nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. So let's act together, preserve our democracy. God bless you all. May God protect our troops.

That's the best way to unite our nation. You know, there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. There's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices and that time and place is now,\" he said.\n\nOval Office addresses have historically been serious moments for presidents to speak to the American people at times of national crisis or to make major policy announcements.\n\nBiden, who returned to the White House on Tuesday after testing negative for COVID-19, addressed his decision to step aside from his campaign and said that he was framing the 2024 election as a choice \"between moving forward and backwards, between hope and hate\" and casting his decision as a matter of democracy.\n\n\"My fellow Americans, it has been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years. Nowhere else on earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as president of the United States,\" the US President said.\n\nBiden recalled the extraordinary American presidents, including Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt.\n\n\"In this sacred space, I'm surrounded by portraits of extraordinary American presidents. Thomas Jefferson wrote the immortal words that guide this nation. George Washington showed us that presidents are not kings. Abraham Lincoln, who implored us to reject malice, and Franklin Roosevelt, who inspired us to reject fear, I revere this office, but I love my country more,\" Biden said.\n\nThe US President added that in defence of democracy, which is at stake, it is more important than any title.\n\n\"It's been the honour of my life to serve as your president. But in defence of democracy, which is at stake and is more important than any title. I draw strength and I find joy in working for the American people,\" he said.\n\n\"This sacred task of perfecting our union is not about me. It is about you. Your families. Your futures. It is about 'we, the people,\" he added.\n\n\"We are a great nation because we are good people. When you elected me to this office, I promised to always level with you, to tell you the truth. The truth, the sacred cause of this country, is larger than any one of us,\" he said. \"We must unite to protect it.\"\n\nBiden further noted that now, in just a few months, the Americans will choose the course of America's future.\n\nHe also championed his vice president, who's now taking his place on the ticket, and said that he has made his choice and has made his views known.\n\nCalling the US Vice President tough and capable, Biden said, \"I would like to thank our great vice president, Kamala Harris. She's experienced. She's tough, and she's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country. Now the choice is up to you, the American people.\"\n\nThe Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, meanwhile, said at a rally that Kamala Harris was a \"radical left lunatic\".\n\nAs he was concluding his speech, he said that the choice of president is \"up to you, the American people.\"\n\n\"When Ben Franklin was asked, as he emerged from the convention going on, whether the founders had given America a monarchy or a Republic, Franklin's response was: a republic, if you can keep it...whether we keep our republic, is now in your hands,\" he said.\n\nWhile Biden did not mention Donald Trump by name, he tried to draw a clear contrast with the former president, whose ambition led him to claim victory in an election he did not win four years ago.\n\nBiden said that in America, kings and dictators do not rule, the people do, adding that history is now in the hands of the American people.\n\n\"The great thing about America is, here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands, the idea of America lies in your hands.\"\n\n\"The great thing about America is, here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands. You just have to keep the faith, keep the faith and remember who we are--we're the United States of America, and there is simply nothing, nothing beyond our capacity. We do it together,\" he said.\n\nFurther, Biden also highlighted that over the next six months, he will be focused on his job as US President.\n\n\"Over the next six months, I will be focused on doing my job as president. That means I will continue to lower costs for hard-working families and grow our economy. I will keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose.\"\n\nThe US presidential election will take place on November 5, and Biden is seeking re-election to the post as the Democratic Party nominee. After his June 27 debate with Republican candidate Donald Trump, Democrats put pressure on him to withdraw from the race.\n\nFollowing this, on July 21, Biden formally announced that he was abandoning plans for a second term in office and endorsed his running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris for the election.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris has quickly consolidated support among Democrats and has already secured the backing of enough delegates to be the likely Democratic nominee.

In this sacred space, I'm surrounded by portraits of extraordinary American presidents. Thomas Jefferson wrote the immortal words that guide this nation. George Washington showed us presidents are not kings. Abraham Lincoln implored us to reject malice. Franklin Roosevelt inspired us to reject fear.\n\nI revere this office, but I love my country more. It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it's more important than any title. I draw strength and find joy in working for the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our union is not about me, it's about you. Your families, your futures.\n\nIt's about we the people. And we can never forget that. And I never have. I've made it clear that I believe America is at an inflection point. On those rare moments in history, when the decisions we make now determine our fate of our nation and the world for decades to come, America is going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division.\n\nWe have to decide: Do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy. In this moment, we can see those we disagree with not as enemies but as, I mean, fellow Americans -- can we do that? Does character in public life still matter? I believe you know the answer to these questions because I know you the American people, and I know this:\n\nWe are a great nation because we are a good people. When you elected me to this office, I promised to always level with you, to tell you the truth. And the truth, the sacred cause of this country, is larger than any one of us. Those of us who cherry that cause cherish it so much. The cause of American democracy itself. We must unite to protect it.\n\nIn recent weeks, it has become clear to me that I need to unite my party in this critical endeavor. I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future, all merited a second term. But nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition.\n\nSo I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It's the best way to unite our nation. I know there was a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. There's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now.\n\nOver the next six months, I will be focused on doing my job as president. That means I will continue to lower costs for hard-working families, grow our economy. I will keep defending our personal freedoms and civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose. I will keep calling out hate and extremism, making it clear there is no place, no place in America for political violence or any violence ever, period. I'm going to keep speaking out to protect our kids from gun violence, our planet from climate crisis as an existential threat.\n\nI will keep fighting for my Cancer Moonshot, so we can end cancer as we know it because we can do it. I'm going to call for Supreme Court reform because this is critical to our democracy -- Supreme Court reform. You know, I will keep working to ensure American remains strong, secure and the leader of the free world.\n\nI'm the first president of this century to report to the American people that the United States is not at war anywhere in the world. We will keep rallying a coalition of proud nations to stop Putin from taking over Ukraine and doing more damage. We'll keep NATO stronger, and I will make it more powerful and more united than any time in all of our history. I will keep doing the same for our allies in the Pacific. You know, when I came to the office, the conventional wisdom was that China would inevitably pass, surpass the United States.\n\nThat's not the case anymore. And I'm going to keep working to end the war in Gaza, bring home all the hostages and bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war. We are also working around the clock to bring home Americans being unjustly detained all around the world.\n\nYou know, we've come so far since my inauguration. On that day, I told you as I stood in that winter -- we are stood in a winter of peril and winter of possibilities. Peril and possibilities. We are in the group of, we were in the group of the worse pandemic in the century. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. We came together as Americans. We got through it. We emerged stronger, more prosperous and more secure.\n\nToday we have the strongest economy in the world, creating nearly 16 million new jobs -- a record. Wages are up, inflation continues to come down, the racial wealth gap is the lowest it's been in 20 years. We are literally rebuilding our entire nation -- urban, suburban and rural and tribal communities. Manufacturing has come back to America. We are leading the world again in chips and science and innovation. We finally beat Big Pharma after all these years to lower the cost of prescription drugs for seniors.\n\nAnd I'm going to keep fighting to make sure we lower the cost for everyone, not just seniors. More people have health care today in America than ever before. I signed one of the most significant laws helping millions of veterans and their families who were exposed to toxic materials. You know, most significant climate law ever, ever in the history of the world. The first major gun safety law in 30 years.\n\nAnd today, the violent crime rate is at a 50-year low. We are also securing our border. Border crossings are lower today than when the previous administration left office. I've kept my commitment to appoint the first Black woman to the Supreme Court of the United States of America. I also kept my commitment to have an administration that looks like America and be a president for all Americans. That's what I've done.\n\nI ran for president four years ago because I believed and still do that the soul of America was at stake. The very nature of who we are was at stake. That is still the case. America is an idea. An idea stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant. It's the most powerful idea in the history of the world. That idea is that we hold these truths to be self-evident.\n\nWe are all created equal, endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights: life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. We've never fully lived up to it -- to this sacred idea -- but we've never walked away from it either. And I do not believe the American people will walk away from it now.\n\nIn just a few months, the American people will choose the course of America's future. I made my choice. I've made my views known. I would like to thank our great vice president, Kamala Harris. She is experienced, she is tough, she is capable. She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country.\n\nNow the choice is up to you, the American people. When you make that choice, remember the words of Benjamin Franklin hanging on my wall here in the Oval Office, alongside the busts of Dr. King and Rosa Parks and Cesar Chavez.\n\nWhen Ben Franklin was asked, as he emerged from the convention going on, whether the founders have given America a monarchy or a republic, Franklin's response was: \"A republic, if you can keep it.\" A republic, if you can keep it. Whether we keep our republic is now in your hands. My fellow Americans, it's been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years.\n\nNowhere else on Earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and in Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as the president of the United States, but here I am.\n\nThat's what's so special about America. We are a nation of promise and possibilities. Of dreamers and doers. Of ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things. I've given my heart and my soul to our nation, like so many others. And I've been blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people. I hope you have some idea how grateful I am to all of you.\n\nThe great thing about America is, here kings and dictators do not rule -- the people do. History is in your hands. The power's in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands. You just have to keep faith -- keep the faith -- and remember who we are.

Nowhere else on earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as president of the United States,\" he stated.\n\nBiden mentioned exemplary American leaders, such as Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin Roosevelt.\n\n\"In this sacred space, I'm surrounded by portraits of extraordinary American presidents.

The truth, the sacred cause of this country, is larger than any one of us.\"\n\nHe backed his vice president, who is now taking his place on the ticket, and stated that he has taken his decision and expressed his opinions.\n\nBiden praised the US Vice President as strong and capable, saying, \"I would like to thank our great vice president, Kamala Harris. She's experienced. She's tough, and she's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country.

A few days later, he released a resignation letter announcing he would no longer run for re-election and would instead endorse his Vice President, Kamala Harris. However, he never addressed the nation publicly, as he was in isolation.\n\nNow that he has tested negative for COVID-19, Joe Biden addressed the nation live for the first time from the White House on Wednesday.\n\nLast week, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed that Biden tested positive \"following his first event in Las Vegas.\"\n\n\"He is vaccinated and boosted and he is experiencing mild symptoms. He will be returning to Delaware where he will self-isolate and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time,\" Jean-Pierre said on Wednesday, July 17.\n\n\"The White House will provide regular updates on the President's status as he continues to carry out the full duties of the office while in isolation,\" the White House press secretary added, which explains why the public had not seen the President out in public for nearly a week.\n\nOn Sunday, the President of the United States withdrew from the presidential race, telling America, \"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President\" before thanking Harris \"for being an extraordinary partner in all this work.\"\n\nA day after declaring his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race, Joe Biden called into the campaign headquarters to encourage staffers to fully support his Vice President, Kamala Harris.\n\nIsolating at his Delaware home due to COVID-19, Biden assured everyone that he was \"not going anywhere\" and promised to actively campaign for Harris. \"If I didn't have COVID, I'd be standing there with you,\" said Biden, his voice slightly hoarse.\n\nJoe Biden opened his address from the Oval Office with, \"In this sacred space, I'm surrounded by portraits extraordinary American presidents. Thomas Jefferson wrote the immortal words that guide this nation. George Washington showed us presidents are not kings. Abraham Lincoln, who implored us to reject malice, Franklin Roosevelt, who inspired us to reject fear. I revere this office, but I love my country more.\"\n\nApproximately ten minutes into his speech, Joe Biden said he feels his performance warrants a second term as president, but he has decided to step aside in favor of allowing another candidate to take the lead.\n\n\"I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That's the best way to unite our nation. You know, there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. There's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices, and that time and place is now,\" the president said in his speech from the Oval Office.\n\nNot only did Biden claim that it \"is in the interest of my party and the country to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president,\" but he also thanked Vice President Kamala Harris \"for being an extraordinary partner in all this work.\"\n\n\"Over the past three and a half years, we have made great progress as a Nation,\" he said. \"Today, America has the strongest economy in the world. We've made historic investments in rebuilding our Nation, in lowering prescription drug costs for seniors, and in expanding affordable health care to a record number of Americans. We've provided critically needed care to a million veterans exposed to toxic substances.\"\n\nThe President went on to say that America \"passed the first gun safety law in 30 years, appointed the first African American woman to the Supreme Court, and passed the most significant climate legislation in the history of the world.\"\n\n\"America has never been better positioned to lead than we are today,\" Biden said before announcing his endorsement for Kamala Harris.\n\n\"My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it's been the best decision I've made,\" Joe Biden wrote in a follow-up statement. \"Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats -- it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let's do this.\"\n\nOn Sunday, the Vice President thanked Biden for his endorsement, saying, \"I am honored to have the President's endorsement, and my intention is to earn and win this nomination. Over the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election.\"\n\n\"And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead. I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party -- and unite our nation -- to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda,\" she continued. \"We have 107 days until Election Day. Together, we will fight. And together, we will win.\"", "source": {"uri": "theblast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Blast"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kelly_coffey_behrens@theblast.com", "name": "Kelly Coffey-Behrens", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abraham Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

The following is a transcript of his speech, as recorded by The New York Times.\n\nMy fellow Americans, I'm speaking to you tonight from behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. In this sacred space, I'm surrounded by portraits of extraordinary American presidents. Thomas Jefferson wrote the immortal words that guide this nation. George Washington showed us presidents are not kings. Abraham Lincoln implored us to reject malice. Franklin Roosevelt inspired us to reject fear.\n\nI revere this office, but I love my country more. It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it's more important than any title. I draw strength and find joy in working for the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our union is not about me, it's about you. Your families, your futures.\n\nIt's about we the people. And we can never forget that. And I never have. I've made it clear that I believe America is at an inflection point. On those rare moments in history, when the decisions we make now determine our fate of our nation and the world for decades to come, America is going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division.\n\nWe have to decide: Do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy. In this moment, we can see those we disagree with not as enemies but as, I mean, fellow Americans -- can we do that? Does character in public life still matter? I believe you know the answer to these questions because I know you the American people, and I know this:\n\nWe are a great nation because we are a good people. When you elected me to this office, I promised to always level with you, to tell you the truth. And the truth, the sacred cause of this country, is larger than any one of us. Those of us who cherry that cause cherish it so much. The cause of American democracy itself. We must unite to protect it.\n\nIn recent weeks, it has become clear to me that I need to unite my party in this critical endeavor. I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future, all merited a second term. But nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition.\n\nSo I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It's the best way to unite our nation. I know there was a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. There's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now.\n\nOver the next six months, I will be focused on doing my job as president. That means I will continue to lower costs for hard-working families, grow our economy. I will keep defending our personal freedoms and civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose. I will keep calling out hate and extremism, making it clear there is no place, no place in America for political violence or any violence ever, period. I'm going to keep speaking out to protect our kids from gun violence, our planet from climate crisis as an existential threat.\n\nI will keep fighting for my Cancer Moonshot, so we can end cancer as we know it because we can do it. I'm going to call for Supreme Court reform because this is critical to our democracy -- Supreme Court reform. You know, I will keep working to ensure American remains strong, secure and the leader of the free world.\n\nI'm the first president of this century to report to the American people that the United States is not at war anywhere in the world. We will keep rallying a coalition of proud nations to stop Putin from taking over Ukraine and doing more damage. We'll keep NATO stronger, and I will make it more powerful and more united than any time in all of our history. I will keep doing the same for our allies in the Pacific. You know, when I came to the office, the conventional wisdom was that China would inevitably pass, surpass the United States.\n\nThat's not the case anymore. And I'm going to keep working to end the war in Gaza, bring home all the hostages and bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war. We are also working around the clock to bring home Americans being unjustly detained all around the world.\n\nYou know, we've come so far since my inauguration. On that day, I told you as I stood in that winter -- we are stood in a winter of peril and winter of possibilities. Peril and possibilities. We are in the group of, we were in the group of the worse pandemic in the century. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. We came together as Americans. We got through it. We emerged stronger, more prosperous and more secure.\n\nToday we have the strongest economy in the world, creating nearly 16 million new jobs -- a record. Wages are up, inflation continues to come down, the racial wealth gap is the lowest it's been in 20 years. We are literally rebuilding our entire nation -- urban, suburban and rural and tribal communities. Manufacturing has come back to America. We are leading the world again in chips and science and innovation. We finally beat Big Pharma after all these years to lower the cost of prescription drugs for seniors.\n\nAnd I'm going to keep fighting to make sure we lower the cost for everyone, not just seniors. More people have health care today in America than ever before. I signed one of the most significant laws helping millions of veterans and their families who were exposed to toxic materials. You know, most significant climate law ever, ever in the history of the world. The first major gun safety law in 30 years.\n\nAnd today, the violent crime rate is at a 50-year low. We are also securing our border. Border crossings are lower today than when the previous administration left office. I've kept my commitment to appoint the first Black woman to the Supreme Court of the United States of America. I also kept my commitment to have an administration that looks like America and be a president for all Americans. That's what I've done.\n\nI ran for president four years ago because I believed and still do that the soul of America was at stake. The very nature of who we are was at stake. That is still the case. America is an idea. An idea stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant. It's the most powerful idea in the history of the world. That idea is that we hold these truths to be self-evident.\n\nWe are all created equal, endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights: life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. We've never fully lived up to it -- to this sacred idea -- but we've never walked away from it either. And I do not believe the American people will walk away from it now.\n\nIn just a few months, the American people will choose the course of America's future. I made my choice. I've made my views known. I would like to thank our great vice president, Kamala Harris. She is experienced, she is tough, she is capable. She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country.\n\nNow the choice is up to you, the American people. When you make that choice, remember the words of Benjamin Franklin hanging on my wall here in the Oval Office, alongside the busts of Dr. King and Rosa Parks and Cesar Chavez.\n\nWhen Ben Franklin was asked, as he emerged from the convention going on, whether the founders have given America a monarchy or a republic, Franklin's response was: \"A republic, if you can keep it.\" A republic, if you can keep it. Whether we keep our republic is now in your hands. My fellow Americans, it's been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years.\n\nNowhere else on Earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pa., and in Claymont, Del., one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as the president of the United States, but here I am.\n\nThat's what's so special about America. We are a nation of promise and possibilities. Of dreamers and doers. Of ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things. I've given my heart and my soul to our nation, like so many others. And I've been blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people. I hope you have some idea how grateful I am to all of you.\n\nThe great thing about America is, here kings and dictators do not rule -- the people do. History is in your hands. The power's in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands. You just have to keep faith -- keep the faith -- and remember who we are. We are the United States of America, and there are simply nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. So let's act together, preserve our democracy. God bless you all and may God protect our troops.

But one thing is certain: when NBC called it a speech \"for the history books,\" they were spreading even faker news than usual.\n\n\"Our fellow Americans, I'm speaking to you tonight from behind the Resolute desk in the Oval Office,\" Biden began, his black and unblinking eyes fixed on the camera. \"This sacred space is surrounded by portraits of extraordinary American presidents.\" He listed Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin Roosevelt, none of whom would have had anything to do with him -- even corrupt FDR. It's ironic that Biden highlighted Lincoln, who was hated by the Democrats of his day and assassinated for supporting a policy the Democrats opposed (civil rights for black Americans).\n\nBiden claimed, \"I revere this office, I love my country more. It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president, but in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it's more important than any title.\" Leaving that sentence apparently unfinished, the obviously weak president babbled, \"I draw strength and I find joy from working for the American people. But this sacred task, perfecting our union, it's not about me. It's about you ... about We the People.\" He claimed to have never forgot that, and rambled, \"America is at an inflection point, one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now determine our fate of our nation and the world for decades to come.\"Without once denouncing pro-Hamas leftists currently\n\nBiden, who has been mired in scandal from the Biden family's corruption, asked, \"Does character in public life still matter? ... We are a great nation, because we are good people.\" He asserted, \"I promise to always love with you. To tell you the truth\" in the cause of \"American democracy itself, which unite to protect it [sic]. You know, in recent weeks it's become clear to me that I need to unite my party in this critical endeavor.\" He asserted that his record, leadership, and vision fitted him for a second term but \"the best way forward, is to pass the torch to a new generation\" and \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nThe unblinking president murmured:\n\nOver the next six months, I'll be focused on doing my job as president. That means I'll continue to lower costs for hardworking families, grow our economy. I'll keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose. I'll keep calling out hate and extremism. Make it clear there is no place no place in America, for political violence, or any violence ever, period. I'm going to keep keep speaking out to protect our kids from gun violence, our planet from climate crisis is the existential threat. I'll keep fighting my for my cancer moonshot so we can end cancer as we know it because we can do it. I'm gonna call for Supreme Court reform ... to ensure American remain strong and secure in the leader of the free world.\n\nBiden's economy is an utter catastrophe, with still-rising inflation and dropping real wages. His supporters continue to riot and celebrate Islamic terrorists, soon after someone took a shot at Donald Trump, Biden's GOP opponent. And no one believes Biden is actually the functioning leader of the free world.\n\nThen, Biden, who has prolonged the war in Ukraine and funded the Palestinian jihadis fighting the war with Israel, asserted, \"I'm the first president in this century to report to the American people that the United States is not at war anywhere in the world. We'll keep rallying a coalition of proud nations to stop Putin from taking over Ukraine and doing more damage.\" He mentioned NATO and \"allies in the Pacific\" and then came out with another whopper. Trump was the strongest anti-Communist China U.S. president in recent history, while Biden's administration has kowtowed to China, but Biden slurred, \"You know, when I came to office, the conventional wisdom was that China would inevitably -- would inevitably pass the United -- surpass the United States. That's not the case anymore.\"\n\nIsraeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu is in America now, but Biden didn't mention our ally Israel at all, referring to \"the war in Gaza\" and the Hamas hostages (without mentioning Hamas). \"We've come so far since my inauguration,\" he alleged, before launching into a completely incomprehensible blather: \"On that day, I told you as I stood in that winter, we stood in a winter apparel. And when our possibilities -- parallel possibilities were in the grip of the -- we were in the grip of the worst pandemic and essentially the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\"\n\nAccording to Biden, \"We emerged stronger and more prosperous and more secure. Today we have the strongest economy. ... Wages are up. Inflation continues to come down. ... Manufacturing has come back to America we're leading the world again, in chips and science and innovation. We finally beat Big Pharma.\" This is all nonsense, but would have sounded good had someone mentally competent been saying it.\n\nBiden ended by mentioning veterans and \"the most significant climate law ever, ever in the history of the world\" and falsely saying \"the violent -- violent crime rate is at a 50 year low. We're also securing our border.\" Actually, the border crisis continues at dangerously high levels. Biden bragged about appointing a black woman to the Supreme Court, and claimed \"I ran for President four years ago because I believed in still doing that the soul America is at stake, the very nature of who we are is at stake. That's still the case. America is an idea. An idea is stronger than any armory, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant. It's more powerful than any idea in the history of the world.\"\n\nHe quoted the Declaration of Independence, praised Kamala Harris as \"tough\" and \"capable\" without specifically endorsing her for president, and quoted Benjamin Franklin who \"is hanging on my wall here in the Oval Office alongside the busts of Dr. King and Rosa Parks and Cesar Chavez.\" When Ben Franklin \"emerged from the con-con -- convention going on\" he said America had \"a Republic if you can keep it.\" Biden added:\n\nMy fellow Americans, it's that's been the privilege of my life to serve this nation over 50 years, nowhere else on earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the resolute desk in the Oval Office as president of the United States. Here I am. That's what's so special about America ... I've given my heart and my soul to my nation.\n\nI think we're all doubting at this point if he has a heart and soul, but when Biden, the trampler of liberties, again claimed the People control America instead of dictators, it seemed particularly laughable. \"You just have to keep faith,\" Biden muttered. \"Keep the faith and remember who we are, we're the United States of America and there's simply nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together.

In this sacred space, I'm surrounded by portraits of extraordinary American presidents. Thomas Jefferson wrote the immortal words that guide this nation. George Washington, who showed us presidents are not kings. Abraham Lincoln, who implored us to reject malice. Franklin Roosevelt, who inspired us to reject fear.\n\nI revere this office, but I love my country more.\n\nIt's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it's more important than any title.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It's about you, your families, your futures. It's about we the people, and we can never forget that. And I never have.\n\nI've made it clear that I believe America is at an inflection point, one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now will determine our fate of our nation and the world for decades to come.\n\nAmerica is going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division. We have to decide, do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy? In this moment, we can see those we disagree with not as enemies, but as fellow Americans. Can we do that? Does character in public life still matter?\n\nI believe you know the answer to these questions because I know you, the American people, and I know this, we are a great nation because we are a good people.\n\nWhen you elected me to this office, I promised to always level with you, to tell you the truth. And the truth, the sacred cause of this country, is larger than any one of us, and those of us who cherish that cause cherish it so much, a cause of American democracy itself must unite to protect it.\n\nYou know, in recent weeks it's become clear to me that I needed to unite my party in this critical endeavor. I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future all merited a second term, but nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy, and that includes personal ambition.\n\nSo I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That's the best way to unite our nation. I know there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life, but there's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices, and that time and place is now.\n\nOver the next six months, I'll be focused on doing my job as president. That means I'll continue to lower costs for hard-working families, grow our economy. I'll keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose. I'll keep calling out hate and extremism, make it clear there is no place, no place in America for political violence or any violence ever, period. I'm going to keep speaking out to protect our kids from gun violence, our planet from climate crisis, is the existential threat.\n\nAnd I will keep fighting for my for my cancer moonshot, so we can end cancer as we know it because we can do it. And I'm going to call for Supreme Court reform because this is critical to our democracy, Supreme Court reform. You know, I will keep working to ensure America remains strong and secure and the leader of the free world.\n\nI'm the first president in this century to report to the American people that the United States is not at war anywhere in the world. We'll keep rallying a coalition of proud nations to stop Putin from taking over Ukraine and doing more damage. We'll keep NATO stronger, and I'll make it more powerful and more united than at any time in all of our history. I'll keep doing the same for allies in the Pacific.\n\nYou know, when I came to office, the conventional wisdom was that China would inevitably surpass the United States. That's not the case anymore. And I'm going to keep working to end the war in Gaza, bring home all the hostages and bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war.\n\nWe're also working around the clock to bring home Americans being unjustly detained all around the world. You know, we've come so far since my inauguration. On that day, I told you as I stood in that winter -- we stood in a winter of peril and a winter of possibilities, peril and possibilities. We were in the grip of the worst pandemic in the century, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War, but we came together as Americans, and we got through it. We emerged stronger, more prosperous and more secure.\n\nToday, we have the strongest economy in the world, creating nearly 16 million new jobs -- a record. Wages are up, inflation continues to come down, the racial wealth gap is the lowest it's been in 20 years. We're literally rebuilding our entire nation, urban, suburban, rural and tribal communities. Manufacturing has come back to America.\n\nWe're leading the world again in chips and science and innovation. We finally beat Big Pharma after all these years, to lower the cost of prescription drugs for seniors, and I'm going to keep fighting to make sure we lower the cost for everyone, not just seniors.\n\nMore people have health care today in America than ever before. And I signed one of the most significant laws helping millions of veterans and their families who were exposed to toxic materials. You know, the most significant climate law ever, ever in the history of the world, the first major gun safety law in 30 years. And today, violent crime rate is at a 50-year low.\n\nWe're also securing our border. Border crossings are lower today than when the previous administration left office. And I've kept my commitment to appoint the first Black woman to the Supreme Court of the United States of America. I also kept my commitment to have an administration that looks like America and be a president for all Americans.\n\nThat's what I've done. I ran for president four years ago because I believed, and still do, that the soul of America was at stake. The very nature of who we are was at stake and that's still the case. America is an idea, an idea stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant.\n\nIt's the most powerful idea in the history of the world. That idea is that we hold these truths to be self-evident. We're all created equal, endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights, life, liberty, pursuit of happiness. We've never fully lived up to it, to this sacred idea, but we've never walked away from it either and I do not believe the American people will walk away from it now.\n\nIn just a few months, the American people will choose the course of America's future. I made my choice. I made my views known. I would like to thank our great Vice President Kamala Harris. She's experienced, she's tough, she's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country. Now the choice is up to you, the American people.\n\nWhen you make that choice, remember the words of Benjamin Franklin. It's hanging on my wall here in the Oval Office, alongside the bust of Dr. King and Rosa Parks and Cesar Chavez. When Ben Franklin was asked as he emerged from the convention going on, whether the founders have given America a monarchy or republic, Franklin's response was \"a republic, if you can keep it.\" A republic if you can keep it. Whether we keep our republic is now in your hands.\n\nMy fellow Americans, it's been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years. Nowhere else on earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as President of the United States, but here I am. That's what's so special about America.\n\nWe are a nation of promise and possibilities, of dreamers and doers, of ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things. I've given my heart and my soul to our nation, like so many others. I've been blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people. I hope you have some idea how grateful I am to all of you.\n\nThe great thing about America is here kings and dictators do not rule, the people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands. We just have to keep faith, keep the faith and remember who we are. We're the United States of America and there's simply nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together.\n\nSo let's act together, preserve our democracy. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

It was more like a scrape... It's along the lines of couples getting their own initials tattooed on each other.'\n\nAlthough Piers pointed out it was a 'bit different' to a tattoo, Armie defended himself by adding it was 'less permanent. I guarantee it was such a small thing.'\n\nThe TV presenter noted his shock, to which Armie responded: 'Yes, I think to some it probably sounds really strange. To some, it probably sounds like a very romantic gesture.'\n\nHe also spoke about the 'bigger picture' on Bill Maher's Club Random podcast where he added: 'I'm not performing surgery, you know, it's like all of these things in a consensual relationship that were pre-discussed and all of these things that were consented to whatever they might have been between two people.'\n\nPaige dated Armie for a few months in 2020 when she was 22. At the time he was still married to his ex-wife Elizabeth Chambers with whom he shares two children.\n\nIn Paige's full recount of the incident to Page Six, she said: 'I kind of sat back and let it happen. I didn't really know what to do or say ... As sad as that is, I wanted him to like me and feel like I was down for what he wanted.'\n\nThe entrepreneur added: 'I said, \"How am I supposed to see other people when I have bruises?\" He said, \"That's the point.\" I think it was a part of marking and branding.'\n\nIn a separate interview with Vanity Fair, she spoke about how she felt controlled during their relationship.\n\n'He started making rules for me of things I could and couldn't do, who I could have over, who I couldn't.\n\n'He told me that I couldn't have anyone else in my bed. And then I just started to feel really unsafe and really sick to my stomach about things.'\n\nShe added that he was a 'scary person'.\n\nIn a recent interview, Armie shared that he is 'grateful' for the social media uproar around his alleged cannibalism.\n\n'But here's what I will say about it.

The actor also denied drawing blood and insisted it was a consensual act.\n\nSince making his return to the spotlight, Armie Hammer has talked about how happy he was about being canceled over cannibalism allegations.\n\nDuring a chat with Piers Morgan, \"The Lone Ranger\" actor admitted to his ex-girlfriend Lorenze's claim that he once \"branded\" her with a knife. However, he claimed that it was more of a \"scrape\" or \"tattoo\" in an attempt to downplay Lorenze's unsettling account.\n\nIn 2021, Lorenze accused Hammer of \"marking and branding\" her during their four-month relationship. She told the Daily Mail at the time that Hammer had carved his initial into her groin and licked the blood during a wild sexual encounter.\n\nHowever, Hammer, speaking to Morgan, insisted he didn't \"brand\" Lorenze and claimed no blood was drawn.\n\n\"I wouldn't say brand, no,\" Hammer stated. \"There was a scenario that we talked about beforehand, that we had discussed where, you know, I would basically take a little, tiny point and just kind of trace the letter 'A' -- just like the tip of a small knife.\"\n\nHe added, \"I mean, there wasn't even blood in the situation. It was more like a scrape... It's along the lines of couples getting their own initials tattooed on each other.\"\n\nDuring the interview, Morgan pointed out that using a knife on someone's skin is \"a bit different from a tattoo.\" In response, Hammer retorted: \"[It's] less permanent. I guarantee it was such a small thing.\"\n\nWhen Morgan admitted he was \"shocked\" by the incident, Hammer attempted to frame it as a \"romantic gesture.\"\n\n\"Yes, I think to some, it probably sounds really strange. To some, it probably sounds like a very romantic gesture,\" Hammer explained, per the Daily Mail.\n\nThe actor also insisted that he had nothing to \"gain\" from a sexual experience that his partner didn't appreciate or enjoy.\n\n\"That was also a huge sense of validation for me, making this person that I'm with feel good, making this person that I'm with, I don't know if I can say this, climax,\" Hammer told Morgan. \"These were things that made me feel good and made me feel powerful, which I desperately needed because I didn't know how to give them to myself.\"\n\nIn 2021, Lorenze shared a photo of her \"A\" scar with Daily Mail, detailing her four-month relationship with Hammer.\n\nDuring the interview, Lorenze accused Hammer of being a narcissist and sexual deviant who allegedly had wild fantasies and desires that could \"seriously injure another woman.\"\n\nShe also claimed that he was obsessed with biting her and begged to take chunks of flesh from her arm to eat. Lorenze said their time in Los Angeles was \"like a real-life 50 Shades Of Grey without the love.\"\n\nHammer's ex-girlfriend, Effie Angelova, also accused him of \"violently\" raping and abusing her in 2017.\n\nHammer denied the rape allegations through his attorney, insisting that all of his sexual encounters were \"completely consensual, discussed and agreed upon in advance, and mutually participatory.\"\n\nDuring an appearance on the \"Painful Lessons\" podcast, Hammer weighed in on the allegations that he has cannibalism fantasies.\n\n\"People called me a cannibal, and everyone believed them,\" he said, per Page Six. \"They're like, 'Yep, that guy ate people.' Like, what? What are you talking about? Do you know what you have to do to be a cannibal? You have to eat people! How am I going to be a cannibal?! It was bizarre.\"\n\nThe actor then expressed his gratitude for the allegations, noting that they came at a time of his struggle.\n\nHe said there were \"discrepancies in whatever it was that people said,\" adding that he's \"now at a place in my life where I'm grateful for every single bit of it.\"\n\n\"I'm actually now at a place where I'm really grateful for it because where I was in my life before all of that stuff happened to me, I didn't feel good, I never felt satisfied, I never had enough, I never was in a place where I was happy with myself where I had self-esteem,\" Hammer explained.\n\nOn a recent episode of Bill Maher's podcast this week, Hammer discussed a recent psychiatric evaluation, revealing it showed he \"had issues\" but is \"not what people are saying.\"\n\nHe described the evaluation as \"glowing,\" stating that the report acknowledged his issues but clarified he was not as portrayed.\n\n\"I had to subject myself to a multi-month full psychological evaluation, and the report at the end of that was glowing. By the way, they're like, 'he's got issues, but he's not what people are saying.,\" he shared.\n\nHammer also addressed his past mistakes, including infidelity with his ex-wife, Elizabeth Chambers, with whom he shares two children.\n\nHe admitted, \"I cheated on my wife. I used people to feel better, and I was callous and inconsiderate with people and their emotions and their well-being. I wanted what I wanted and I was going to take it at any cost, even if it was at an emotional cost of someone else.\"\n\nHammer added: \"And that is sh--ty behavior. There are things in my behavior that I have to take accountability for because that is pivotal for me learning and growing from it.\"", "source": {"uri": "theblast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Blast"}, "authors": [{"uri": "favour_adegoke@theblast.com", "name": "Favour Adegoke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armie_Hammer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Armie Hammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cannibalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tattoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lone_Ranger_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Lone Ranger (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paraphilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Narcissism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Maher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Maher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infidelity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infidelity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychological evaluation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-esteem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-esteem"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/brand-img/123/1707x793/2023/04/mega281119_001-scaled-e1681771225674.jpg?", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746996", "eventUri": "eng-9746996", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

He was not charged with any crimes and continues to deny all criminal allegations.\n\nWhile on Piers Morgan Uncensored, Armie broke down several of the allegations, saying that many of them were rooted in kink and consensual role play in his relationships.\n\nHe also addressed cheating on his ex-wife, speaking about how many partners he had while married. While he didn't provide specifics, he made some shocking claims.\n\nOn the topic of his relationship with Effie Angelova, who accused him of sexual assault and abuse, he described it as \"a very intense affair, very sexually charged, between two people with very similar proclivities and kinks.\"\n\n\"Any of those conversations that we [he and Angelova] had inside of that relationship, when you take them outside of that context and put them into broad daylight, it doesn't look so good,\" he acknowledged.\n\nArmie said that he \"was introduced to\" a lot of kinks that he enjoyed by Effie, saying, \"She had more experience in the area.\"\n\n\"You know, different people have different sexual fantasies. And there's a very broad spectrum of sexuality, and people are allowed to engage with their own sexuality however it fits them and what they do,\" he said.\n\nHe seemingly acknowledged that cannibalism role-play played a part in their relationship saying that it \"was just sort of born out of a desire, to sort of like, 'I want you so completely,' and 'I want you so totally' that it's almost like 'I want to eat you.'\"\n\nThe actor spoke about some of the other allegations of abuse while talking about another ex, Courtney Vucekovich.\n\n\"I will say this, there are people that I left who were hurt and who were upset. None of those people were hurt or upset because I pushed any sexual boundaries that they weren't interested in exploring or trying,\" he said.\n\nHe even addressed accusations that he branded his ex, Paige Lorenze, implying that the accusation was taken out of context.\n\n\"I wouldn't say brand. No ... There was a scenario that we talked about beforehand, that we had discussed where, you know, I would basically take a little, tiny point and just kind of trace the letter 'A,'\" he claimed. \"Just like the tip of a small knife ... I mean, there wasn't even blood in the situation. It was more like a scrape. It's along the lines of couples getting their own initials tattooed on each other.\"\n\nWhen the topic turned to his time with Elizabeth, Armie said that he \"was faithful for a long time\" but eventually cheated.\n\nHe said that he was involved with \"probably more [people] than the average person would be exposed to\" while they were together.\n\n\"I wouldn't say many hundreds,\" he continued. \"No, you know, I would say enough.\"\n\nThe star said that this point in his life \"was a dark, painful time.\"\n\n\"It's also something that I have to accept is on me. I had an affair on my wife.

I would basically take a little, tiny point and just kind of trace the letter 'A' - just like the tip of a small knife.\"\n\nHammer noted that \"there wasn't even blood\" in the situation. \"It was more like a scrape,\" he added. \"It's along the lines of couples getting their own initials tattooed on each other.\"\n\nThe excerpt from Piers Morgan Uncensored had Morgan, 59, pushing back on Hammer's claims. The host said that using a knife on someone is \"a bit different to a tattoo,\" to which Hammer replied, \"[It was] less permanent. I guarantee it was such a small thing. I think to some it probably sounds really strange. To some, it probably sounds like a very romantic gesture.\"\n\nArmie Hammer's Most Controversial Moments Over the Years\n\nHammer maintained there was nothing \"to be gained\" in \"having a sexual experience\" his partner didn't \"appreciate or enjoy.\"\n\n\"That was also a huge sense of validation for me,\" he continued. \"Making this person that I'm with feel good, making this person that I'm with - I don't know if I can say this - climax. Like, these were things that made me feel good and made me feel powerful - which I desperately needed - because I didn't know how to give them to myself.\"\n\nLorenze, 26, opened up in January 2021 about her two-month relationship with Hammer and accused the actor of carving his initials into her lower hip.\n\n\"I want Armie to address his demons, see the pain and trauma that he has caused me and other women. He told me there's a whole community that will do this stuff, that it was not criminal. He really thought that his fantasies were normal behavior in the BDSM, non-normative, sexual kink community. I thought that this is what it was. I thought I was safe,\" Lorenze told the Daily Mail at the time. \"You can be just as traumatized by consensual sex. It's unacceptable that he coerces women into agreeing to let him hurt them.\"\n\nLorenze told Page Six that Hammer used a knife to make the letter \"A\" on her body, which left visible blood and bruises on her.\n\nCelebrity Splits of 2024: Stars Who Have Called It Quits This Year\n\n\"I kind of sat back and let it happen,\" she recalled. \"I didn't really know what to do or say. As sad as that is, I wanted him to like me and feel like I was down for what he wanted. ... I said, 'How am I supposed to see other people when I have bruises?' He said, 'That's the point.' I think it was a part of marking and branding.\"\n\nIn a statement to Us Weekly, Hammer's lawyer vehemently denied the allegations.\n\n\"These assertions about Mr. Hammer are patently untrue. Any interactions with this person, or any partner of his, were completely consensual in that they were fully discussed, agreed upon, and mutually participatory,\" Hammer's attorney said. \"The stories being perpetuated in the media are a misguided attempt to present a one-sided narrative with the goal of tarnishing Mr. Hammer's reputation, and communications from the individuals involved prove that.\"\n\nLorenze was one of several women who accused Hammer of sending graphic text messages about his sexual fantasies, including rape, mutilation and cannibalism. He was also accused of sexual assault, which Hammer's attorneys denied at the time. (The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office confirmed in June 2023 that it was not moving forward with the sexual assault charges after a two-year investigation.)\n\nJohnny Depp and More Stars Who Were Fired From Jobs\n\nEarlier this month, Hammer offered an update on how the scandal affected his career.\n\n\"[I'm] happier than I've ever been in my entire life,\" Hammer revealed on the July 14 episode of Bill Maher's \"Club Random\" podcast. \"The good place only comes from walking through hell.\"\n\nHammer said therapy - and rehab - helped him kick an addiction to drugs, alcohol and sex.\n\n\"Therapy for me has been a life changer. I needed an adjustment,\" he added. \"Here's what I think would have happened had none of this gone on - the cataclysmic tectonic shift in my life wouldn't have happened.

But he insisted that it was totally okay because \"there wasn't even blood.\" Dude, what?? Trying to defend himself while talking about this controversial topic, the actor said:\n\n\"I wouldn't say brand, no. There was a scenario that we talked about beforehand, that we had discussed where, you know, I would basically take a little, tiny point and just kind of trace the letter 'A' -- just like the tip of a small knife.\"\n\nUhhh...\n\nRelated: Tom Sandoval FIRES Lawyer & Promises To Drop Ariana Madix Lawsuit\n\nHe went on to justify his actions, adding:\n\n\"I mean, there wasn't even blood in the situation. It was more like a scrape... It's along the lines of couples getting their own initials tattooed on each other.\"\n\nThe TV host then pointed out that using a knife on someone is \"a bit different to a tattoo,\" but Armie pushed back, noting it was \"less permanent.\" He continued:\n\n\"I guarantee it was such a small thing.\"\n\nThe size does NOT matter if the person wasn't a willing participant! And while Armie is insisting it was consensual, the 26-year-old, who he dated for four months in 2020, has claimed she was not pleased by his actions. Just saying!\n\nElsewhere in the interview, the broadcaster expressed being a \"little bit shocked\" by the Death on the Nile alum's actions, to which the Hollywood star replied:\n\n\"Yes, I think to some it probably sounds really strange. To some, it probably sounds like a very romantic gesture.\"\n\nThe 37-year-old also argued that he had nothing \"to be gained\" in \"having a sexual experience that my partner didn't appreciate or enjoy.\" He explained:\n\n\"That was also a huge sense of validation for me, making this person that I'm with feel good, making this person that I'm with, I don't know if I can say this, climax. [...] Like, these were things that made me feel good and made me feel powerful, which I desperately needed, because I didn't know how to give them to myself.\"\n\nHmm.\n\nSounds like there was a messy power dynamic going on! Especially when you hear how Paige tells the story. As Perezcious readers know, in January 2021, the Dairy Boy founder accused Elizabeth Chambers's ex-husband of using a knife to brand her with the letter \"A\" near her vagina, insisting there was visible blood and bruising -- and that it left a permanent scar. She recalled:\n\n\"I kind of sat back and let it happen. I didn't really know what to do or say ... As sad as that is, I wanted him to like me and feel like I was down for what he wanted.\"\n\nThe influencer also alleged that Armie wanted her to be his \"little slave\" and show off and \"be proud of\" her bruises, she claimed:\n\n\"I said, 'How am I supposed to see other people when I have bruises?' He said, 'That's the point.' I think it was a part of marking and branding.\"\n\nSeveral other women have since come forward with allegations against the father of two, including other claims about his BDSM fantasies and even mental, emotional, and sexual abuse -- plus the unforgettable cannibalism bombshell. Armie has hit back at the allegations, such as denying raping ex-girlfriend Effie Angelova. He was ultimately not charged on that after a lengthy investigation.\n\nAmid the controversy, which came shortly after his divorce, his life went into shambles. And yet earlier this week while chatting with Bill Maher he said he's \"never been happier.\" Huh?! The full Piers Morgan interview will be out later on Friday. Thoughts?

Like, these were things that made me feel good and made me feel powerful -- which I desperately needed -- because I didn't know how to give them to myself.\"\n\nLorenze, 26, opened up in January 2021 about her two-month relationship with Hammer and accused the actor of carving his initials into her lower hip.\n\n\"I want Armie to address his demons, see the pain and trauma that he has caused me and other women. He told me there's a whole community that will do this stuff, that it was not criminal. He really thought that his fantasies were normal behavior in the BDSM, non-normative, sexual kink community. I thought that this is what it was. I thought I was safe,\" Lorenze told the Daily Mail at the time. \"You can be just as traumatized by consensual sex. It's unacceptable that he coerces women into agreeing to let him hurt them.\"\n\nLorenze told Page Six that Hammer used a knife to make the letter \"A\" on her body, which left visible blood and bruises on her.\n\n\"I kind of sat back and let it happen,\" she recalled. \"I didn't really know what to do or say. As sad as that is, I wanted him to like me and feel like I was down for what he wanted. ... I said, 'How am I supposed to see other people when I have bruises?' He said, 'That's the point.' I think it was a part of marking and branding.\"\n\nIn a statement to Us Weekly, Hammer's lawyer vehemently denied the allegations.\n\n\"These assertions about Mr. Hammer are patently untrue. Any interactions with this person, or any partner of his, were completely consensual in that they were fully discussed, agreed upon, and mutually participatory,\" Hammer's attorney said. \"The stories being perpetuated in the media are a misguided attempt to present a one-sided narrative with the goal of tarnishing Mr. Hammer's reputation, and communications from the individuals involved prove that.\"\n\nLorenze was one of several women who accused Hammer of sending graphic text messages about his sexual fantasies, including rape, mutilation and cannibalism. He was also accused of sexual assault, which Hammer's attorneys denied at the time. (The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office confirmed in June 2023 that it was not moving forward with the sexual assault charges after a two-year investigation.)\n\n\"[I'm] happier than I've ever been in my entire life,\" Hammer revealed on the July 14 episode of Bill Maher's \"Club Random\" podcast. \"The good place only comes from walking through hell.\"\n\nHammer said therapy -- and rehab -- helped him kick an addiction to drugs, alcohol and sex.\n\n\"Therapy for me has been a life changer.

You have to have actually eaten someone,\" Hammer told Morgan via Page Six.\n\nWhile discussing his relationship with Effie Angelova, who accused him of sexual assault and abuse, Hammer called it \"a very intense affair,\" adding that it was \"very sexually charged, between two people with very similar proclivities and kinks.\"\n\n\"Any of those conversations that we [he and Angelova] had inside of that relationship, when you take them outside of that context and put them into broad daylight, it doesn't look so good,\" he acknowledged.\n\nHammer said that he was \"introduced to\" a lot of kinks that he enjoyed by Effie, saying, \"She had more experience in the area.\"\n\n\"You know, different people have different sexual fantasies. And there's a very broad spectrum of sexuality, and people are allowed to engage with their own sexuality however it fits them and what they do,\" he explained.\n\nHammer also seemed to acknowledge that cannibalism role-play played a part in their relationship saying that it \"was just sort of born out of a desire, to sort of like, 'I want you so completely,' and 'I want you so totally' that it's almost like 'I want to eat you.''\n\nWhile speaking to Morgan, Hammer also touched on some of the other allegations of abuse made by Courtney Vucekovich, another one of his exes.\n\n\"I will say this, there are people that I left who were hurt and who were upset. None of those people were hurt or upset because I pushed any sexual boundaries that they weren't interested in exploring or trying,\" he said.\n\nHe even addressed accusations that he branded his ex, Paige Lorenze, implying that the accusation was taken out of context.\n\n\"I wouldn't say brand. No ... There was a scenario that we talked about beforehand, that we had discussed where, you know, I would basically take a little, tiny point and just kind of trace the letter 'A,'\" he claimed. \"Just like the tip of a small knife ... I mean, there wasn't even blood in the situation. It was more like a scrape. It's along the lines of couples getting their own initials tattooed on each other.\"\n\nAs far as the multiple affairs he had while with Chambers, Hammer admitted that he was faithful to his wife, with whom he shares daughter, Harper, 9, and son, Ford, 7, for \"a long time\" before he eventually cheated.\n\nHe said that he was involved with \"probably more [people] than the average person would be exposed to\" while they were together.\n\n\"I wouldn't say many hundreds,\" Hammer quipped.\n\n\"No, you know, I would say enough,\" he added before calling it a \"dark, painful time\" in his life.\n\n\"I's also something that I have to accept is on me. I had an affair on my wife,\" Hammer maintained. \"Obviously, I'm not the first person in the history of Hollywood to do that, but I did it, and it's less than becoming behavior that I have to own.\"", "source": {"uri": "toofab.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Toofab"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cannibalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan_Uncensored", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan Uncensored"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armie_Hammer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Armie Hammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_fantasy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual fantasy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tattoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.toofab.com/image/0c/16by9/2020/10/01/0c7b7236838a47a28e4957f7da6c45c4_xl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746996", "eventUri": "eng-9746996", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Ultimately, no criminal charges were brought against Hammer and he has maintained that all relationships were consensual.\n\nDespite the fallout, Hammer shared with Morgan that some of his former Hollywood colleagues did reach out, including Robert Downey Jr. But when asked about reports that the \"Iron Man\" star paid for his rehab, Hammer said, \"No, he did not. He did not pay for me to go to rehab.\"\n\nWhen prodded as to whether Downey has been \"supportive,\" Hammer was hesitant to answer.\n\n\"I would say that yes, he has,\" Hammer said, to which Morgan replied, \"You don't seem convinced, because that was well reported. Is that really not the case?\"\n\nHammer said, \"I don't want to bring anyone else into my situation. There are a number of people who have been extremely helpful, and I'm incredibly grateful.\"\n\nPushed further, Hammer said that Downey was helpful to him \"in the way where [when] anyone in Hollywood who suffers from any sort of addiction issues -- whether it be alcohol or process addiction or drugs -- decides to get sober, that guy will find you, and he will help you. It's amazing.\"\n\nAsked for the best advice Downey gave him, Hammer said: \"'Sit down, shut up, everything is going to be OK.'\"\n\nRepresentatives for Downey did not immediately respond to Variety's request for comment.\n\nMorgan asked whether Hammer's past co-stars Leonardo DiCaprio (\"J. Edgar\") or Julia Roberts (\"Mirror Mirror\") had reached out in support, to which Hammer said no.\n\n\"I try not to think about the people who didn't contact me. I try to focus on the people who did, who showed their support,\" Hammer said, adding that \"a few\" notable people contacted him during his tribulations.\n\n\"Luca Guadagnino has also been vocally supportive, which is something that I could not appreciate more,\" Hammer said. (Asked by Variety in 2022 if he would include Hammer's character in a hopeful \"Call Me by Your Name\" sequel, Guadagnino said, \"Yeah, of course.\")\n\nHammer added, \"But at the same time, I'm also well-aware that it is a precarious situation right now, and anyone who vocalizes support comes under fire. I understand that my situation was inflammatory, and anyone who gets too close might also light on fire.\"\n\nMorgan asked Hammer if his \"Lone Ranger\" co-star Johnny Depp had been in touch, \"given what he went through.\"\n\n\"We've communicated a few times... phone, FaceTime,\" Hammer said. \"I didn't bring [my situation] to him, he didn't bring his to me. It was more of a social call -- 'How are you, good to see you, glad you're still alive.' That kind of thing.\"\n\nDuring the hour-and-20-minute interview, Morgan also addressed the allegations that Hammer engaged in cannibalism fantasies, straight up asking him: \"Are you a cannibal?\"\n\n\"No,\" Hammer replied. \"You know what you have to do to be a cannibal? You have to have actually eaten someone. So, no.\"\n\nExpanding on the topic, Hammer said: \"I don't think that's any different than when someone looks at a baby and goes, 'Oh my God, look at those cute little fat legs, I just want to eat you up.'\"\n\nHammer also touched on an allegation that he branded a former partner. Though he \"wouldn't say brand,\" Hammer admitted to using \"the tip of a small knife\" to \"trace the letter A.\"\n\n\"There wasn't even blood in the situation, it was more like a scrape,\" he added.\n\nHammer also recently appeared on Bill Maher's \"Club Random\" podcast, where he said that being \"canceled\" was \"liberating.\"\n\n\"Had none of this gone on ... my life would have kept going exactly as it was,\" Hammer told Maher. \"And I know that that would ultimately only lead in one place, and that's death.\"\n\nThough Hammer once again denied all allegations on Maher's podcast, he did admit to some \"bad behavior.\"\n\n\"I cheated on my wife. I used people to make me feel better. I was callous and inconsiderate with people and their emotions and their well-being. ... And that is shitty behavior,\" Hammer said. \"There are things in my behavior that I have to take accountability for, right? Because that is pivotal for me, learning and growing from it.\"\n\nAddressing the LAPD investigation, Hammer said, \"I was under the Sword of Damocles, legally speaking, for two and a half years. They went through phones, emails, eyewitness reports... they investigated me for two and a half years in a time where if they could have nailed someone like me, it would have been such a boon for the LAPD.\"", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armie_Hammer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Armie Hammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downey,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Downey, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Downey, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_Me_by_Your_Name_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Call Me by Your Name (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan_Uncensored", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan Uncensored"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein_sexual_abuse_cases", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse cases"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Downey_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Downey Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Guadagnino", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luca Guadagnino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julia Roberts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_DiCaprio", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leonardo DiCaprio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannibalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Depp", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Johnny Depp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Maher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Maher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FaceTime"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/armie-rdj.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746996", "eventUri": "eng-9746996", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The disgraced actor appeared on \"Piers Morgan Uncensored\" and denied that he ever sexually assaulted anyone, including former girlfriend Effie Angelova, then went on to lightly deny being a cannibal by deflecting the question.\n\nWhen asked if he was a cannibal, Hammer replied, \"Do you know what you have to do to be a cannibal?\" Morgan pressed the matter further by clarifying that the reason people branded him a cannibal is his own text message stating the fact, and the text flashed on the screen. \"Did you ever eat any human flesh?\" Morgan asked, in the video shared to X.\n\nHammer's response was not the one most would have expected.\n\n\"This is a question I never thought I'd have to answer, by the way,\" Hammer said in the edited and condensed teaser clip.\n\nThose who want to know more will have to tune in to view the entire segment.\n\nHammer went on to attempt to justify the label of 'cannibal' that has hung over him since the allegations first surfaced.\n\n\"I don't think that's any different than when someone looks at a baby and goes, 'Oh my God! Look at those cute little fat legs, I just wanna eat you up,'\" he said.\n\nMorgan brought up one of the allegations that Hammer's ex-girlfriend, Paige Lorenze, had made against him, by asking him if he did indeed brand her with a knife.

He was also accused of rape and sexual assault by multiple women, which he strongly denies.\n\nIn a yet-to-air interview on Piers Morgan Uncensored, Hammer is asked by Morgan whether he has ever eaten human flesh, while also being questioned about the messages that came to light in 2021.\n\nIn a teaser for the interview, Morgans ask the actor: \"Are you a cannibal?\" to which Hammer replies: \"You know what you have to do to be a cannibal?\"\n\nMorgan then asks Hammer directly whether he's ever eaten human flesh, with the actor saying \"it's not a question I thought I'd have to answer\".\n\nOne message allegedly sent by Hammer to a former girlfriend reads: \"You just live to obey and be my slave. I will own you. That's my soul. My brain. My spirit. My body. Would you come and be my property till you die? If I wanted to cut off one of your toes and keep it with me in my pocket so I always had a piece of you in my possession?\"\n\nAddressing the message, Hammer tells Morgan: \"This was a very intense [affair]... very sexually-charged, between two people ... Different people have different sexual fantasies.\"\n\nHe added: \"But I don't think that's any different than when someone looks at a baby and goes, 'Oh my God, look at those cute little fat legs, I just want to eat you up.'\"\n\nOf the wider allegations of abuse, he claimed: \"None of those people were hurt or upset because I pushed any sexual boundaries.\"\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Hammer admitted that he \"scraped\" his initials into his ex-girlfriend Paige Lorenze's groin with the tip of a knife during their four-month relationship.\n\nHowever, the star stressed that he didn't \"brand\" her, as she had previously alleged, and that \"there wasn't even blood\".\n\n\"There was a scenario that we talked about beforehand, that we had discussed where, you know, I would basically take a little, tiny point and just kind of trace the letter 'A' - just like the tip of a small knife.\"\n\nHe added: \"I mean, there wasn't even blood in the situation. It was more like a scrape... It's along the lines of couples getting their own initials tattooed on each other.\"\n\nWhen Morgan suggested that using a knife was \"a bit different to a tattoo\", Hammer replied that it \"was less permanent. I guarantee it was such a small thing.\"\n\nAfter Morgan said he was \"shocked\" by Hammer's admission, the actor replied: \"Yes, I think to some it probably sounds really strange. To some, it probably sounds like a very romantic gesture.\"\n\nLast year, Hammer addressed claims of sexual misconduct from two women, Courtney Vucekovich and Paige Lorenze, denying any criminal wrongdoing but admitting he \"one million per cent\" emotionally abused them. During the 2023 interview, Hammer also said he attempted suicide in 2021 in the wake of the allegations, while also revealing he was sexually abused aged 13.\n\nFor help, advice or more information regarding sexual harassment, assault and rape in the UK, visit the Rape Crisis charity website.

He was also accused of rape by one woman. After an investigation into the accusations, the actor was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing.\n\nThe District Attorney's office in Los Angeles County said in 2023 after deciding against charging Hammer: In this case, those prosecutors conducted an extremely thorough review, but determined that at this time, there is insufficient evidence to charge Mr. Hammer with a crime. As prosecutors, we have an ethical responsibility to only charge cases that we can prove beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nOne of the accusations made against Hammer was by Lorenze, who was in a relationship with the actor for four months. She said he carved his initials into her groin with a knife, which she described as \"marking and branding\". Lorenze also alleged that Hammer licked blood from the wound after the incident.\n\nNow, in a snippet released from an upcoming interview on Piers Morgan Uncensored, Hammer has responded to Lorenze's allegation. \"I wouldn't say brand, no,\" he told the former Good Morning Britain presenter.\n\nHammer continued: \"There was a scenario that we talked about beforehand, that we had discussed where, you know, I would basically take a little, tiny point and just kind of trace the letter 'A' - just like the tip of a small knife.\"\n\nThe actor then responded to the claim he licked blood from Lorenze's wound, stating, \"I mean, there wasn't even blood in the situation.

To some, it probably sounds like a very romantic gesture.\"\n\nHammer's interview on Piers Morgan Uncensored is set to air on July 19th at 6pm GMT on YouTube. While he's largely remained out of the public eye over the last three years, and at one stage, was reportedly selling time shares in the Cayman Islands, Hammer did also recently appear on Bill Maher's Club Random podcast.\n\nDueing the episode, Hammer discussed the sexual abuse he suffered as a 13-year-old which he said lasted for \"about a year\". He told Maher: \"It was a member of clergy, like that kind of stereotypical kind of trope. It was something I never ever spoke about, and was never open about and never okay with, and had so much shame about.\"", "source": {"uri": "faroutmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Far Out Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_taysom@faroutmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Joe Taysom", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armie_Hammer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Armie Hammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_fetishism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual fetishism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Spacey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Spacey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannibalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan_Uncensored", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan Uncensored"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tattoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Maher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Maher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trope_(literature)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trope (literature)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stereotype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayman_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cayman Islands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cayman Islands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/static/uploads/1/2024/06/Armie-Hammer-Actor-2019-Far-Out-Magazine.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746996", "eventUri": "eng-9746996", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 2319, "textEnd": 2328}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

But he claims he used the \"tip of a small knife\" and added that blood was not drawn.\n\nWhen discussing the allegation that he sent messages to her with regards to what he wanted to do with her sexually, he said: \"This was a very intense (affair), very sexually charged, between two people. Different people have different sexual fantasies. But I don't think that's any different than when someone looks at a baby and goes, 'Oh my God, look at those cute little fat legs, I just want to eat you up'.\"\n\nIn the teaser, Piers asked the star about the claim that he told a former partner that he felt like a \"god\" when allegedly standing over them with a knife. In response, Armie said: \"I don't remember saying those things.\" He continued: \"None of those people were hurt or upset because I pushed any sexual boundaries.\"\n\nThe father of two said he hit rock bottom and felt suicidal as he was not allowed to \"be alone\" with his children at one stage. Addressing claims of cannibalism, Piers pushed the actor further and asked: \"Are you a cannibal?\" Armie responded saying: \"You know what you have to do to be a cannibal?\"\n\nUnwilling to leave the matter there, Piers questioned further: \"Well the reason they believe it, is you said 'I'm 100% a cannibal.' Have you ever eaten any human flesh?\" Clearly uncomfortable with the probe, Armie added: \"Not a question I thought I'd have to answer, by the way.\" Armie allegedly sent a message that claimed he wanted to cut off a woman's toe and was hoping to \"eat\" her flesh.\n\nOne message allegedly sent to an ex girlfriend read: \"You just live to obey and be my slave. I will own you. That's my soul. My brain. My spirit. My body. Would you come and be my property till you die? If I wanted to cut off one of your toes and keep it with me in my pocket so I always had a piece of you in my possession?\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok,Snapchat,Instagram,Twitter,Facebook,YouTubeandThreads", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucretia_munro@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Lucretia Munro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armie_Hammer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Armie Hammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pelvis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan_Uncensored", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan Uncensored"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannibalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soul music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33283634.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_hammer-main.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746996", "eventUri": "eng-9746996", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

I understand that my situation was inflammatory, and anyone who gets too close might also light on fire.\"\n\nGuadagnino has shut down rumors that his cannibal film \"Bones and All\" was related to allegations against Hammer; the director also said in 2022 that he would still cast Hammer in a \"Call Me by Your Name\" sequel. Hammer was accused of rape in early 2021 but cleared after a two-and-a-half-year investigation by the LAPD. He was never charged.\n\nAnd Guadagnino isn't the only former Hammer collaborator who still stays in touch. Hammer's \"Lone Ranger\" co-star Johnny Depp, who has had his own very public legal troubles surrounding allegations of abuse, has checked in. The duo have bonded, Hammer said, especially \"given what [Depp] went through.\" Depp won a $15 defamation judgment in 2022 against ex Amber Heard in a widely publicized trial after she accused him of abuse. Though Depp was found liable in one count of defamation and was court-ordered to award her $2 million in damages.\n\n\"We've communicated a few times -- phone, FaceTime,\" Hammer said of Depp. \"I didn't bring [my situation] to him. He didn't bring his to me. It was more of a social call -- 'How are you, good to see you, glad you're still alive.' That kind of thing.\"\n\nRobert Downey Jr., who was believed to have paid for Hammer's rehab according to a source for Vanity Fair, has also been helpful \"in the way where [when] anyone in Hollywood who suffers from any sort of addiction issues -- whether it be alcohol or process addiction or drugs -- decides to get sober, that guy will find you, and he will help you. It's amazing.\"\n\nAccording to Hammer, Oscar winner Downey advised Hammer to \"sit down, shut up\" and know that \"everything is going to be OK.\"\n\nHowever, Hammer clarified that Downey \"did not pay for me to go to rehab\" despite the 2022 report.\n\nOthers have been supportive and helpful in their own way, but Hammer didn't want to name names.\n\n\"I don't want to bring anyone else into my situation,\" Hammer said. \"There are a number of people who have been extremely helpful, and I'm incredibly grateful.\"\n\nHe added, \"I try not to think about the people who didn't contact me. I try to focus on the people who did, who showed their support.\"", "source": {"uri": "indiewire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IndieWire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samantha_bergeson@indiewire.com", "name": "Samantha Bergeson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Guadagnino", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luca Guadagnino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armie_Hammer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Armie Hammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Depp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Johnny Depp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_Me_by_Your_Name_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Call Me by Your Name (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_misconduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual misconduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bones_and_All", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bones and All"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Downey_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Downey Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannibalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_Heard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amber Heard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FaceTime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vanity Fair (magazine)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Armie-Hammer-Luca-Guadgnino-and-Timothee-Chalamet.jpg?w=650", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746996", "eventUri": "eng-9746996", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

The 37-year-old actor was accused of cannibalism and sexual assault by multiple partners in 2021, though he was never charged with any crimes and continues to deny all criminal allegations.\n\nDuring the interview, Hammer clarified that many of the accusations stemmed from consensual role play and kink in his relationships. He addressed the shocking rumors about cannibalism directly, emphasizing, 'You know what you have to do to be a cannibal? You have to have actually eaten someone,' and stressed that he had never done that.\n\nTwisters - Official Trailer\n\nHammer also spoke about his extramarital affairs, acknowledging that he had cheated on his ex-wife Elizabeth Chambers but did not provide specific details about the number of partners. He made some surprising claims, highlighting the complexity of his actions and relationships.\n\nDiscussing his relationship with Effie Angelova, who accused him of sexual assault and abuse, Hammer described it as 'a very intense affair, very sexually charged, between two people with very similar proclivities and kinks.' He admitted that their private conversations, when viewed out of context, seemed alarming. 'Any of those conversations that we [he and Angelova] had inside of that relationship, when you take them outside of that context and put them into broad daylight, it doesn't look so good,' he acknowledged.\n\nHammer also shared that Effie introduced him to many kinks he came to enjoy, noting that 'She had more experience in the area.' He emphasized the importance of understanding the broad spectrum of sexuality and respecting individual sexual fantasies, saying, 'Different people have different sexual fantasies. And there's a very broad spectrum of sexuality, and people are allowed to engage with their own sexuality however it fits them and what they do.\n\nThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Behind the scenes, he has, over nearly two decades, been quietly reaching his hand back and helping other stars on their sobriety journeys, an act of service that is a tenet of 12-step programs. Armie Hammer confirmed as such during a new appearance on Piers Morgan Uncensored.\n\nHammer, who has been on something of a press tour as he opens up on the scandal that claimed his marriage and career, sat for an extended 1-hour and 20-minute interview with Morgan. In addition to facing questions about sexual misconduct and an official police investigation that ended with no charges, Hammer talked about his recovery and the Hollywood support that he's received along the way. He also cleared up some rumors that have been circulating since a Vanity Fair expos\u00e9 reported that Downey was a key figure in his recovery.\n\nAsked whether Downey picked up the tab for his residential treatment stay, Hammer refuted the claims. \"No, he did not. He did not pay for me to go to rehab.\" In an attempt to be discreet and protect those who have guided him in private, Hammer proceeded with caution in answering Morgan's questions about that support. He confirmed Downey was there for him, saying that, when \"anyone in Hollywood who suffers from any sort of addiction issues -- whether it be alcohol or process addiction or drugs -- decides to get sober, that guy will find you, and he will help you. It's amazing.\"\n\nHammer then confirmed the best advice he received from the Iron Man star: \"'Sit down, shut up, everything is going to be OK.'\" Before he said that, however, Hammer hesitated slightly because he said, \"I don't want to bring anyone else into my situation. There are a number of people who have been extremely helpful, and I'm incredibly grateful.\"\n\nHe did single out his Call Me By Your Name director Luca Guadagnino for being \"vocal and supportive,\" as well as Johnny Depp for multiple conversations, which were not directly tied to his situation.\n\n\"It is a precarious situation right now. Anyone who vocalizes support comes under fire and I understand my situation was inflammatory and anyone who gets too close might also light on fire,\" said Hammer, who seemed to sidestep actually naming names for fear of bringing others into his situation.\n\nHe did, however then go on to share an exchange he had with a man named Clark who helped broaden his perspective on the situation, likening it to a house on fire. Hammer said he was frustrated and complaining very early on in his sobriety journey when he was receiving emails from friends (presumably famous) offering their support amid the firestorm of tabloid coverage.\n\n\"People are sending me private emails saying, 'I know this isn't you,'\" Hammer said of the version of him that was being reported about in the press. \"Why are you sending me emails? Say something about this. Like, why is everyone saying to me directly, 'This isn't real.' Say it publicly. Like, help me.\"\n\nBut his friend Clark set him straight by asking, \"What kind of friend are you? ... You set your house on fire. Your house is burning to the ground, and now, what? You want your friends to run into a burning house with you. What happens to your friends when they run into a burning house?' I said, 'They would get burned.'\" Hammer then came to the realization that he would want his friends to stay as far away from the house as possible.\n\nHammer continued: \"There's a difference between me appreciating and celebrating the ones who ran into the fire on their own volition and me expecting or asking them to.\"\n\nThe appearance on Morgan's show follows Hammer's other recent appearances on Bill Maher's Club Random podcast as well as Tyler Ramsey's Painful Lessons podcast. The latter appearance found him expressing gratitude for where he's at in his life these days despite what it cost him along the way.\n\n\"Whatever it was that people said, whatever it was that happened, I'm now at a place in my life where I'm grateful for every single bit of it,\" Hammer said. \"I'm actually now at a place where I'm really grateful for it, because where I was in my life before all of that stuff happened to me, I didn't feel good. I never felt satisfied. I never had enough.

Amaewhule from parading himself as the Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly.\n\nThe appellate court also dismissed the decision of the state high court stopping 24 other members of the Assembly who allegedly defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC) from accessing the complex or carrying out any legislative assignment in the name of the Rivers State House of Assembly.\n\nThe appellate court in determining the issue of jurisdiction of a lower court to hear and also grant an ex parte order, held that the Federal High Court is the only court that has the exclusive jurisdiction to hear cases which bordered on whether or not the seats of the lawmakers, who allegedly defected, were vacant or their terms had ceased, citing section 273 of the Constitution.\n\nThe unanimous judgement of the three-member panel of Justices of the appellate court led by Justice Jimi Olukayode-Bada held that, granting the far-reaching order, restraining the lawmakers from further acting as members of the Assembly without hearing from the appellants amounted to a denial of their right to a fair hearing.\n\nJustice Bada held that no urgency warranted the grant of the ex-parte order by the Rivers State High Court and upheld the appeal filed by a factional speaker of the River State House of Assembly, Martins Amaewhule and 24 others against the Speaker, Victor Oko-Jumbo and two others.\n\nThe Appeal Court held that: \"The trial court ought to have listened to both sides before coming to a decision prejudicial to the appellants.\"\n\nIt would be recalled that a Rivers state high court sitting in Port Harcourt restrained 25 members of the Rivers House of Assembly from parading themselves as lawmakers.\n\nA ruling of the Rivers state High Court on an exparte application, restrained the lawmakers from conducting legislative sittings anywhere -- including within the legislative quarters.\n\nThe court also restrained the Rivers state governor, Siminalayi Fubara from interfacing with or accepting resolutions and bills from the 25 lawmakers.\n\nThe suit was filed by Victor Oko-Jumbo, factional speaker, and two other lawmakers, Sokari Goodboy and Orubienimigha Adolphus Timothy, who are loyal to Fubara.", "source": {"uri": "tribuneonlineng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tribune Online"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Martin Amaewhule from parading himself as the Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly.\n\nThe trial court also restrained 24 other members of the Assembly from accessing the complex or carrying out any such legislative assignment in the name of the Rivers State House of Assembly.\n\nMiffed by the decision, Amaewhule and the other lawmakers had approached the Court of Appeal to void the restraining order.\n\nThe appellants predicated their case on the grounds that the issue that the state High Court ventured into was the exclusive preserve of a Federal High Court.\n\nThey cited Section 272(3) of the Constitution in urging the appellate court to reverse their removal from the Rivers State House of Assembly, on account of their defection to the APC.\n\nDelivering judgment on Thursday, a three-man panel led by Justice Jimi Olukayode-Bada, held that the appeal was meritorious and subsequently ordered their reinstatement as Rivers State lawmakers.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Democratic Coalition (NDC) has rejected the appellate court's judgment, observing that it is one of the lowest point of Nigeria's democracy.\n\nIt is their argument that by this decision, the appellate court has given licence to politicians to defect from the party which sponsored them to power to another without consequences.\n\nIn a statement, the Executive Director of the coalition, Dr. Samson Iroegbunam, who accused the appellate court of providing cover for illegality, submitted that the former lawmakers cannot and should not be allowed to hide under the law that they have no regard for.\n\nHe added that the coalition found it confounding that the Court of Appeal gave the ruling on the logic that only the Federal High Court and no other court has the jurisdiction to determine cases of tenures and vacancies of the House of Assembly, governors and president and not the state High Courts, even though the constitution did not make it clear which court should have jurisdiction to hear and determine disputes concerning when an elected office holder should cease to hold office.\n\nThe Coalition further declared that the reinstatement of the former members of the Rivers State House of Assembly is against the rule of law, undemocratic, antithetical, retrogressive and provocative to the point of further jeopardising the fragile peace in the state.\n\nIt said the ruling, given its controversial nature, has again heightened concerns about the raging allegations that have been made against the Judiciary.\n\n\"The Appeal Court has now created new complications with the judicial precedence it has set instead of giving rulings that stabilize Nigeria's democracy and enhance the rule of law,\" he said.\n\nThe group urged the people of Rivers State to remain calm as the judgment would not stand the test of time, especially since the democratic-minded stakeholders in the state have indicated that the matter shall be pursued to the Supreme Court until the will of the people of the state is respected.\n\n\"Nigerians should stand up to defend the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which in Section 109. (1) (g) clearly stated that 'A member of a House of Assembly shall vacate his seat in the House if being a person whose election to the House of Assembly was sponsored by a political party, he becomes

and the 24 members of the Rivers State House of Assembly should revert to their positions before the restraining order was made.\n\nThe Court of Appeal held that the only court vested with jurisdiction to to hear the suit filed by Oko-jumbo is the Federal High Court and not the State High Court.\n\nTherefore, the panel unanimously reasoned that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear the suit filed by the 1st to 3rd respindents.\n\nConsequently, it was the contention of the appellate court that the ex parte order which had restrained Amaewhule and the 24 Assembly members,

Victor Oko-Jumbo who subsequently emerged as the Speaker of the Assembly.\n\nThe litigants, who are loyal to the incumbent governor of the state, Siminialayi Fubara, in their suit, contended that Amaewhule and the 24 other defected lawmakers ceased to be members of the Rivers State House of Assembly since December 13, 2023, when their seats were declared vacant.\n\nWhile upholding the case of the plaintiffs, Justice Wali barred the pro-Wike lawmakers from accessing the Assembly complex or carrying out any legislative assignment in the name of the Rivers State House of Assembly.\n\nHowever, dissatisfied with the verdict, Amaewhule and his colleagues approached the appellate court to set it aside.\n\nThey argued that the state high court acted beyond its jurisdiction when it issued the restraining order against them.\n\nIn the appeal, marked: CA/PH/198/2024, the pro-Wike lawmakers urged the appellate court to stay the execution of the high court judgement.\n\nThey further prayed to the appellate court to invalidate all the legislative actions that have been taken by the Jumbo-led Rivers State House of Assembly.\n\nMeanwhile, before the case was slated for judgment, the appellate court, in an interim ruling it delivered on June 14, ordered the two factions to maintain the status quo and suspend further actions, pending the determination of the appeal.\n\nThe appellate court further stopped the Rivers State High Court or any other court from entertaining any suit relating to the matter, until it was decided.\n\nOn June 20, Justice Jimi Olukayode Bada-led panel of the appellate court reserved its judgement after the feuding parties adopted their briefs of argument in a proceeding that was conducted virtually.\n\nDelivering its judgement on Thursday, the appellate court held that there was merit in the appeal by the 25 pro-Wike lawmakers.\n\nIt, therefore, invalidated all the restraining orders that were issued against them by the high court.\n\nOther members of the appellate court panel that gave the judgement on Thursday, were Justices Hamma Akawu Barka and Balikisu Bello Aliyu.\n\nThe lawmakers, who won their elections on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, had on December 11, 2023, announced their defection to the APC.\n\nSubsequently, the Rivers Assembly led by the then Speaker, Hon. Edison Ehie, on December 13, declared their seats vacant owing to their defection.", "source": {"uri": "vanguardngr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanguard"}, "authors": [{"uri": "idowu_bankole@vanguardngr.com", "name": "Idowu Bankole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivers_State_House_of_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rivers State House of Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellate_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Appellate court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Capital_Territory,_Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Progressives_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "All Progressives Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivers_State", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rivers State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rivers State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Rivers_State_House_of_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honourable", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Honourable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyesom_Wike", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nyesom Wike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restraining_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Restraining order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoples_Democratic_Party_(Nigeria)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peoples Democratic Party (Nigeria)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakatan_Harapan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakatan Harapan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Artboard-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706448", "eventUri": "eng-9706448", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 629, "textEnd": 635}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 2237, "textEnd": 2244}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 2529, "textEnd": 2536}, {"amb": false, "date": "-12-13", "textStart": 3338, "textEnd": 3349}, {"amb": false, "date": "2013-12-", "textStart": 1316, "textEnd": 1327}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-12-", "textStart": 3200, "textEnd": 3211}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere clarified that the Appeal Court did not void the declaration as vacant, the seats of 27 sacked lawmakers.\n\nIn retrospect, he said Justice Charles Wali of the Rivers State High Court had on May 10, issued an interim injunction that restrained the lawmakers from parading themselves as members of the Assembly, having decamped from the political party that sponsored their elections.\n\nThe court order followed a suit that was filed by Hon. Victor Oko-Jumbo who subsequently emerged as the Speaker of the Assembly.\n\nThe litigants, in their suit, contended that the ousted Speaker, Martin Amaewhule and the other defected lawmakers ceased to be members of the Rivers State House of Assembly since December 13, 2023, when their seats were declared vacant.\n\nWhile upholding the case of the plaintiffs, Justice Wali barred the pro-Wike lawmakers from accessing the Assembly complex or carrying out any legislative assignment in the name of the Rivers State House of Assembly.\n\nHowever, the appellate court, ruling on a suit lodged before it by the former lawmakers who were led by the former Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly, Amaewhule on Thursday, held that the Rivers State High Court, which issued the order, lacked the requisite jurisdiction to do so.\n\nThe court held that Section 272(3) of the Constitution gives the Federal High Court powers to determine whether the seat of a House of Assembly member has become vacant.\n\nReacting to the ruling, Ugochinyere stressed that the Pro-Wike sacked Rivers lawmakers' seat remains vacant as the Appeal Court did not decide on the validity of their defection from the party that elected them nor make declaration on their seats.\n\nAccording to him, the Appeal Court focused on declaring that the Federal High Court is the only court with the jurisdiction to decide on the legality or illegality of decampment, thereby ruling against Rivers High Court proceedings.\n\nHe further stressed that the legal fireworks continues, as the declaration of the vacant seats is still valid and subject of pending litigation.\n\nHe said, \"The Court of Appeal ruling today shouldn't be misconstrued in any way. The sacked Rivers lawmakers' seat remains vacant as Appeal Court didn't decide on the validity of their illegal decampment nor the declaration of their seats vacant.\n\n\"Appeal Court focused on declaring that the Federal High Court is the only court with the jurisdiction to decide on the legality or illegality of decampment thereby ruling against Rivers High Court proceedings.\n\n\"So the actions of the House formerly led by Ehi in declaring the seat vacant have not been declared null and void by any court.

Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere has called on the Inspector General of Police, Kayode Egberokun to stop aiding the FCT minister Nyesom Wike to fight Rivers people.\n\nThis is also as the lawmaker accused the IGP of aiding Wike to fight the incumbent governor of Rivers, Fubara and the Rivers people.\n\nA briefing journalist at the National Assembly on Thursday in Abuja Ugochinyere said that the IGP has not reacted in a way that satisfies the Rivers people since the crisis in the state started in 2023.\n\n\"Why has the IGP not arrested those who carried dynamite during a peaceful protest against pro-Wike supporters? Why is the IGP showing support for the FCT minister by not calling to order those breaking laws and order in the state because one man told them to?\n\n\"We are calling on the IGP to do the right thing and stop giving support to pro-Wike supporters because he is the FCT minister.\n\nReacting to the Court Ruling by the Appeal court today, Ugochinyere stressed that the Pro-Wike sacked Rivers lawmaker's seat remains vacant as the Appeal court didn't decide on the validity of their illegal decampment nor the declaration of their seat vacant.\n\nHe further explained that the Appeal Court didn't void the declaration of the seat of 27 Pro-Wike sacked lawmakers vacant.\n\nJustice Charles Wali of the Rivers State High Court had on May 10, issued an interim injunction that restrained the sacked lawmakers loyal to the immediate past Governor of the state and current Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Nyesom Wike, from parading themselves as members of the Assembly, having decamped from the political party that sponsored their elections.\n\nThe court order followed a suit that was filed by Hon. Victor Oko-Jumbo who subsequently emerged as the Speaker of the Assembly.\n\nThe litigants, in their suit, contended that Amaewhule and the other defected lawmakers ceased to be members of the Rivers State House of Assembly on December 13, 2023, when their seats were declared vacant. While upholding the case of the plaintiffs, Justice Wali barred the pro-Wike lawmakers from accessing the Assembly complex or carrying out any legislative assignment in the name of the Rivers State House of Assembly.\n\nHowever, the appellate court, ruling on a suit lodged before it by the former lawmakers who were led by the former Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly, Hon. Martin Amaewhule on Thursday, held that the Rivers State High Court, which issued the order, lacked the requisite jurisdiction to do so.\n\nUgochinyere reacting further on the ruling said that the Appeal Court focused on declaring that the Federal High Court is the only court with the jurisdiction to decide on the legality or illegality of decampment thereby ruling against Rivers High Court proceedings.\n\nHe further stressed that the legal fireworks continue, as the declaration of the vacant seats is still valid and subject to pending litigation.\n\nHe said, \"The Court of Appeal ruling today shouldn't be misconstrued in any way. The Pro-Wike sacked Rivers lawmaker's seat remains vacant as the Appeal court didn't decide on the validity of their illegal decampment nor the declaration of their seats vacant. A'Court focused on declaring that the Federal High Court is the only court with the jurisdiction to decide on the legality or illegality of decampment thereby ruling against Rivers High Court proceedings.\n\n\"So the actions of the House formerly led by Ehi in declaring the seat vacant have not been declared null and void by any court. Ok Jumbo remains the speaker of Rivers State house of Assembly, the legal fire works continue, as the declaration of the vacant seats is still valid and subject to pending litigation.\n\n\"Also the local government Chairmen whose tenure have since expired remains expired and can't be extended and was never extended.

Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere, made the clarification while addressing news in Abuja, insisting that the Appeal Court did not void the declaration of the seat of 27 Pro-Wike sacked lawmakers.\n\nReacting to the Court ruling, Hon, Ugochinyere stressed that the sacked Rivers lawmakers' seat remained vacant as the Appeal court did not decide on the validity of their illegal defection nor the declaration of their seat vacant.\n\nAccording to him, the Appeal Court focused on declaring that the Federal High Court is the only court with the jurisdiction to decide on the legality or illegality of defection, thereby ruling against Rivers High Court proceedings.\n\nHe further stressed that the legal fireworks continue as the declaration of the vacant seats is still valid and subject to pending litigation.\n\nAccording to him, \"The Court of Appeal ruling today shouldn't be misconstrued in any way. The Pro-Wike sacked Rivers lawmakers' seats remain vacant as the Appeal court didn't decide on the validity of their illegal decampment nor the declaration of their seats vacant. A'Court focused on declaring that the Federal High Court is the only court with the jurisdiction to decide on the legality or illegality of decampment thereby ruling against Rivers High Court proceedings.\n\n\"So the actions of the House formerly led by Ehi in declaring the seat vacant have not been declared null and void by any court. Ok Jumbo remains the Speaker of Rivers State House of Assembly, the legal fireworks continue, as the declaration of the vacant seats is still valid and subject to pending litigation.\n\n\"Also, the local government Chairmen whose tenure has since expired remains expired and can't be extended and was never extended. There's nothing like tenure extension in a democratic setting, it's like a coup taking over constitutional governance.\n\n\"In retrospect, Justice Charles Wali of the Rivers State High Court had on May 10, issued an interim injunction that restrained the sacked lawmakers loyal to the immediate past Governor of the state and current Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Nyesom Wike, from parading themselves as members of the Assembly, having decamped from the political party that sponsored their elections.\n\n\"The court order followed a suit that was filed by Hon. Victor Oko-Jumbo who subsequently emerged as the Speaker of the Assembly.\n\n\"The litigants, in their suit, contended that Amaewhule and the other defected lawmakers ceased to be members of the Rivers State House of Assembly since December 13, 2023, when their seats were declared vacant. While upholding the case of the plaintiffs, Justice Wali barred the pro-Wike lawmakers from accessing the Assembly complex or carrying out any legislative assignment in the name of the Rivers State House of Assembly.", "source": {"uri": "tribuneonlineng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tribune Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_segun_olatunji@tribuneonlineng.com", "name": "Jacob Segun Olatunji", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellate_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Appellate court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honourable", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Honourable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_(Nigeria)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House of Representatives (Nigeria)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imo_State", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Imo State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Imo State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyesom_Wike", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nyesom Wike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Capital_Territory,_Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivers_State_House_of_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rivers State House of Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivers_State", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rivers State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rivers State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CUPP-National-Spokesperson-Ikenga-Imo-Ugochinyere.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706448", "eventUri": "eng-9706448", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 2166, "textEnd": 2172}, {"amb": false, "date": "2013-12-", "textStart": 2775, "textEnd": 2786}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

seat is vacant or his term of office has expired.\n\nRead Also: Let's sustain war against corruption -- Orji Uzor Kalu\n\nIn the main decision, Justice Jimi Bada found that giving the broad injunction prohibiting the lawmakers from further participating as members of the Assembly without hearing from the appellants constituted a deprivation of their right to a fair hearing.\n\nJustice Bada ruled that the Rivers State High Court's ex-parte ruling was not justified since there was no urgency.\n\nBada said: \"The trial court ought to have listened to both sides before coming to a decision prejudicial to the appellants.\"\n\nThe judgment was based on the appeal CA/PH/198/2024 brought by Martin Chike Amaewhule and 24 others, with Victor Oko Jumbo (Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly) as the respondent.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun Nigeria"}, "authors": [{"uri": "seyi_babalola@thesun.ng", "name": "Seyi Babalola", "type": "author",

Nyesom Wike, the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) on Thursday interpreted the judgement of the Court of Appeal, Abuja Division on the vacancy of the seats of Hon. Martins Amaewhule and 24 other Rivers State House of Assembly differently.\n\nWhile Fubara supporters maintain that Hon. Oko-Jumbo remains the authentic Speaker, Wike's supporters claim that Amaewhule, who presided over the affairs of Rivers Assembly when the crisis broke out has been reinstated by the Court of Appeal.\n\nAlthough there has not been an official reaction from both camps following the Appeal Court judgement, their supporters have been battling online, interpreting the judgement in manners that suit the choice of speaker.\n\nThe main claim put forth by Fubara's supporters is that despite the Appeal Court not deciding on the alleged decamping of Amaewhule and others, their seat remains vacant pending when a Federal High Court, which the Appeal Court says has the jurisdiction to entertain such matter handles it.\n\nThey also claimed that there was no time that the Appeal Court reversed the position of the speaker from Oko-Jumbo to Amaewhule, arguing that it is only when the Federal High Court, which the Appeal Court has referred the matter to takes a final decision on the matter.\n\nStill, Fubara's supporters online also claimed that the defection of Amaewhule and others is not in contention; that they truly moved from the People's Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC), stressing that because the Appeal Court did not comment on it does not mean that they didn't defect.\n\nBut Wike's supporters who are behind Amaewhule, are of the position that the Court of Appeal upheld the appeal of Amaewhule and 24 others challenging the decision of the Rivers State High Court, which declared Oko-Jumbo as speaker.\n\nThey also claimed that since the Appeal Court did not back the decision of a Rivers State High Court presided by Justice C.N.

While fans were already expecting a complicated story as Louis (Jacob Anderson) and Claudia (Delainey Hayles) embark on their European quest to find others like them after killing their maker Lestat (Sam Reid), this new look at the season offers a bit more insight on how complicated things have become in both the past and the present. You can check the preview out for yourself below.\n\nOf particular note in the preview is executive producer Mark Johnson's discussion of the Dubai timeline, which sees Daniel Molloy (Eric Bogosian) now having to ask questions of not just Louis, but of the vampire Armand (Assad Zaman), who revealed himself at the end of Season 1.\n\n\"The interview of Interview With the Vampire becomes more important in Season 2,\" he says.\n\n\"The interview goes from playing chess against one person to playing 3D chess against two people,\" Bogosian added.\n\nWhat Is Interview with the Vampire Season 2 About?\n\nYou can read AMC's official description of the second season of Interview With the Vampire here: \"The interview continues in season two. In the year 2022, the vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac (Anderson) recounts his life story to journalist Daniel Molloy (Eric Bogosian). Picking up from the bloody events in New Orleans in 1940 when Louis and teen fledgling Claudia (Hayles) conspired to kill the Vampire Lestat de Lioncourt (Reid), Louis tells of his adventures in Europe, a quest to discover Old World Vampires and the Theatre Des Vampires in Paris, with Claudia. It is in Paris that Louis first meets the Vampire Armand (Assad Zaman). Their courtship and love affair will prove to have devastating consequences both in the past and in the future, and Molloy will probe to get to the truths buried within the memories.\n\nSeason two of Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire is executive produced by award-winning producer Mark Johnson, creator and showrunner Rolin Jones, Mark Taylor, along with Christopher Rice and the late Anne Rice.\"\n\nJones previously teased what fans can expect in the upcoming season of the hit AMC series.\n\n\"I can tell you a couple things. The challenge is that in the second half of the book, there's less plot than there is in the first half of the book and there's so much internal dialogue,\" Jones revealed on AMC's blog. \"There are long scenes of people having discussions. What we're finding that's really cool about that is even though it's not giving you a wealth of plot, what it does have are these really big emotional tentpoles. There are big plot moments that we're retaining from it, but there are these emotional moments too within our plot that might be slightly different than what's in the book.

While waiting for the new episodes, fans have been wondering if Season 2's episode release schedule will follow suit with Season 1, which aired new episodes on AMC+ days earlier than the cable channel. TV Insider has learned that this will change with Season 2. Here's everything we know.\n\nInterview With the Vampire Season 1 aired on Sundays at 9/8c on the AMC cable channel starting in October 2022, but the episodes were available on Fridays for AMC+ subscribers. TV Insider can confirm that will not be the case for the upcoming season. New episodes of Interview With the Vampire Season 2 will air on Sundays at 9/8c on AMC as planned, and the new episodes will be available on AMC+ on Sundays as well. The first two episodes were made available on AMC+ on the series premiere date in 2022, but TV Insider can confirm that Season 2 will only premiere with one episode on both AMC and AMC+.\n\nWhile an exact time of AMC+ availability was not provided, it's commonplace for some streaming services to make new episodes available at the same time that the episode airs on its network. This is the case for HBO shows, which become available to stream on Max at the same time the episode airs, making it so that cable subscribers and cable cutters alike can have the collective experience of watching the show as it airs.\n\nWith the anticipation behind Interview With the Vampire's second season, it makes sense that AMC would want to prevent spoilers from being spread across the internet by not debuting the new episodes days in advance. A show of this quality should be weekly appointment viewing anyway!\n\nRelatedYou Interviewed the Vampires: Jacob Anderson, Sam Reid & More Answer 'IWTV' Fan Questions\n\nAMC experimented with temporarily licensing Interview With the Vampire out to Max in 2023. Season 1, along with select seasons of other AMC original series, was included in the \"AMC+ Picks on Max\" collection from September 1 through Halloween 2023. This gave Interview With the Vampire a second wind of popularity, bringing the series to all-new audiences and growing the fanbase. Given that this was during the Hollywood strikes, it was a perfect time to try and get new eyes on AMC's excellent catalog.\n\nInterview With the Vampire Season 2 stars Jacob Anderson (Louis), Sam Reid (Lestat), Delainey Hayles (the new Claudia), Assad Zaman (Armand), Eric Bogosian (Daniel), and Ben Daniels (Santiago). Guest stars include Justin Kirk in a mystery role, Roxane Duran as Madeleine, Bally Gill as \"Real Rashid,\" and Breaking Bad's David Costabile as Leonard.\n\nHere's the logline for Season 2: \"In the year 2022, the vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac (Anderson) recounts his life story to journalist Daniel Molloy (Bogosian). Picking up from the bloody events in New Orleans in 1940 when Louis and teen fledgling Claudia (Hayles) conspired to kill the Vampire Lestat de Lioncourt (Reid), Louis tells of his adventures in Europe, a quest to discover Old World Vampires and the Theatre Des Vampires in Paris, with Claudia. It is in Paris that Louis first meets the Vampire Armand (Zaman).

Season 2 picks up immediately after the grisly death of Lestat, with Louis trying to piece together what really happened at the Theatre de Vampires. Viewers can expect a new antagonist played by Ben Daniels, as well as a recast for the role of Claudia in the highly anticipated upcoming season.\n\nPremiering just one week away, AMC unveiled a brand new clip for Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire Season 2. The timeless saga unfolds with Louis de Pointe du Lac (Jacob Anderson), the leading vampire, continuing his interview with journalist Daniel Molloy (Eric Bogosian). As Louis tries to piece together his story, the concerned vampire insists on getting every detail right.\n\nThe clip shifts to a scene at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Vampires. Despite the cheering crowds, Louis and Claudia (Delainey Hayles) appear shocked at a startling revelation. With memories of Louis' late lover Lestat de Lioncourt (Sam Reid) resurfacing, and the looming presence of his current lover, the Vampire Armand (Assad Zaman), Louis continues to be haunted by his past.\n\nWhat Is 'Interview with the Vampire' Season 2 About?\n\nSeason 2 of Interview with the Vampirepicks up immediately after the events of the first season. While the season finale showed the grisly death of Lestat, Louis's memory of what actually happened might be hazy. Season 2 also delves into Lestat's origin story at Theatre de Vampires, bringing audiences back to 1700s Paris. If anything, Lestat remains a central figure in the upcoming season, with his presumed death weighing over Louis's shoulders. The second season also further explores Armand's real identity. First introduced as Louis' assistant who went by the name Rashid, it is later revealed that Rashid is a young vampire who may possibly have his own intentions with Louis.\n\nA modern retelling of the 1976 novel, Season 1 first introduced audiences to Louis de Pointe du Lac, who recounts his life as an affluent black man in 1910s New Orleans. His story takes a dramatic turn when he is befriended and charmed by a mysterious vampire, Lestat de Lioncourt. Throughout Season 1, audiences witnessed the highs and lows of their tumultuous relationship, from Louis's transformation into a vampire at the hands of Lestat to saving the teenage Claudia, whose presence only fueled more trouble to Louis' and Lestat's already rocky romance.\n\nViewers may notice a certain casting change in Season 2. The role of Claudia, initially played by Bailey Bass, has been recast with Hayles. The actress previously appeared in BBC's Holby City. Season 2 is also joined by a new face, Ben Daniels, who will play the lead antagonist in Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Vampires. Daniels is best known for his roles in The Crown and Jupiter's Legacy. Also appearing in recurring roles are David Costabile, Roxane Duran, and Bally Gill.\n\nInterview with the Vampire Season 2 officially premieres on AMC and AMC+ on May 12th, 2024.

Thankfully, one new show can change all that.\n\nSummary\n\nInterview with the Vampire offers complex characters and romantic tension similar to The Vampire Diaries, with a unique vampire-centric storyline. Fans of The Vampire Diaries seeking a new fixation should consider exploring the rich drama, romance, and vampiric lore in Interview with the Vampire. The series introduces high stakes and consequences for actions, avoiding resurrection tropes seen in The Vampire Diaries.\n\nThe Vampire Diaries has maintained its fanbase since its first episode dropped in 2009. The show's allure came from its now iconic characters, romantic relationships, and supernatural lore. The fans had all that and more until the show ended. Fortunately, the fans could dive back into the supernatural world with the spin-offs The Originals and Legacies.\n\nHowever, The Vampire Diaries' supernatural world came to an end with Legacies' cancellation, which means fans might be looking for a new fixation. One series that TVD fans might find enticing is Interview with the Vampire. Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire series has all the drama, romantic relationships, and vampiric lore anyone would want, and if TVD fans haven't tuned in yet, they should definitely consider it.\n\nWhat is Interview with the Vampire About?\n\nClose The novel Interview with the Vampire, written by Anne Rice, was first published in 1976. Related How Interview With the Vampire Season 2 Will Deviate From the Books Lestat actor Sam Reid reveals how Season 2 of AMC's gothic horror series Interview with the Vampire will differ from Anne Rice's novels.\n\nBased on Anne Rice's novel of the same name, Interview with the Vampire is a story about Louis de Pointe du Lac, a vampire from Louisiana, sharing his vampiric tale in, of course, an interview-like style. Louis, from Anne Rice's book, was originally a white plantation owner, but the TV series changed his character to be a Black Creole man from the red-light district. Louis' tale can be separated into two different parts: before Lestat and after Lestat. Lestat de Lioncourt is a vampire older than Louis and is directly responsible for Louis' change into a vampire.\n\nThe series takes the audience from the past and to the present flawlessly. Louis' interview takes place in the present, alongside Daniel Molloy, played by Eric Bogosian, as the interviewer. Despite the interview taking place in the present, the majority of the show lives in the past. The past includes how Louis lived in the 1910s, prior to meeting Lestat, and then the years after Lestat came into his life. The story originally spans as far back as 200 years in the past, but so far, Season 1 has only gone back to the 1920s.\n\nThe series is brutal and beautiful. Where there is blood and pain, there is also the beautiful juxtaposition of love. While the love portrayed in the series is mostly toxic, there is no doubt that it is insanely impactful. Love isn't the only emotion found throughout the series. Another aspect of the series is seduction. Characters often become seduced by their circumstances. Whether they are seduced by power or by one another, there is no shortage of intricate emotions shared by these immortal beings. Louis relays these emotions and reminisces on them during his interview with Daniel Molloy, but fans demand more.\n\nFortunately for fans and future fans alike, a new season is rolling around, and new perspectives are promised. Since Louis is the primary person being interviewed, only his story has been fleshed out, and characters like Lestat and Armand have not had their time in the limelight, there is still hope to see more of the past from their perspective. Season 2 of Interview with the Vampire comes out May 12th, 2024, which means more vampiric stories are to come.\n\nInterview with the Vampire's Characters Are Just as Complex as The Vampire Diaries'\n\nClose If The Vampire Diaries and Interview with the Vampire took place in the same universe, Stefan might've encountered Lestat and Louis, since Stefan, Klaus, and Rebekah were all in New Orleans in the 1920s. Related Why Anne Rice's Interview With the Vampire's Music Is an Essential Character It has often been said that music is one of the most important characters in any production. Anne Rice's Interview with a Vampire shows just how.\n\nOne of the best parts of The Vampire Diaries are the characters and how likable they are. From Elena's relatability to Bonnie's underrated yet astounding importance to Katherine's devilish charm, TVD is jam-packed with interesting and complex characters. This is a fact shared with Interview with the Vampire's characters, too. Louis de Pointe du Lac is a wonderfully complex main character. Louis struggles between vampiric urges and humanity, similar to how Stefan struggles with his Ripper status. This struggle ties in perfectly with his relationship with his vampire maker, Lestat.\n\nFor fans of morally corrupt characters like Katherine or Klaus from TVD, Lestat de Lioncourt is the perfect character to latch onto. Lestat is an insecure vampire who is known for his rash decisions and erratic emotions. His insecurity makes for interesting character dynamics between himself and Louis. Not only that, but Lestat's insecure and immature nature becomes a wonderful foil for Claudia.\n\nClaudia is a young girl who later becomes a vampire due to Louis and Lestat's interference. Because she is a vampire, her youth is forever, but her mind is able to grow. She becomes a mature woman who now harbors animosity towards Lestat and his nature. TVD fans might find themselves drawn to Claudia if they were particularly impressed with Caroline. Where Claudia and Caroline overlap is their independence and love for their family. While TVD's Caroline is definitely softer in comparison to Claudia's cunning, Claudia's appreciation for both her real family and Louis shines brightly.\n\nRomantic Tension in Interview with the Vampire Rivals All The Vampire Diaries' Romances\n\nClose Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise were the first to play Louis and Lestat on screen until Jacob Anderson and Sam Reid came into the picture for the series. Related Anne Rice's Interview With the Vampire's Queerness Surpasses the 1994 Film AMC's Interview with the Vampire is a modern retelling of the Anne Rice novel and 1994 film adaptation that puts queerness front and center.\n\nThe movie version of Interview with the Vampire does not hold a candle to how Louis and Lestat's relationship is highlighted in its series counterpart. The series does not shy away from the fact that Louis and Lestat's relationship is romantic. While that romance is extremely chaotic and oftentimes toxic, there is no denying the passion and love the two have for one another. Louis is aware of how bad they are together, for their sake and for the sake of humans around them, and yet he is so strongly attached.\n\nThe passion the two share alone rivals the relationships in The Vampire Diaries. TVD is known for the relationships from the show, such as the iconic pairing between Damon and Elena, as well as the fan-favorite ship between Klaus and Caroline. Despite having a smaller pool of characters, Interview with the Vampire's singular pairing between Louis and Lestat has already created a following among fans and intrigue among burgeoning viewers.\n\nThe allure of Louis and Lestat also lies in their relationship with the surrounding characters, with how detrimental their union is to others despite their obsessions with each other. Damon and Elena created a lot of interesting tension between the characters of TVD, such as Caroline being adamant that they were wrong for each other and the Salvatore brothers' rivalry. However, Damon and Elena could peacefully exist together later on, which made the tension evaporate. Fans of TVD should think Louis and Lestat's admittedly tumultuous relationship is, for lack of a better word, a breath of fresh air.\n\nMore specifically, TVD viewers who were fans of Season 1 Damon and Season 3 Klaus should find a happy home with Interview with the Vampire. The yearning Damon, Klaus, Lestat, and Louis feel for their respective partners are all in the same category of passion. In short, Louis and Lestat would definitely attract a Klaus and Caroline shipper in a heartbeat.\n\nInterview with the Vampire Introduces Stakes The Vampire Diaries Fans Wish They Had\n\nClose Vampires in Interview with the Vampire can read the minds of a lot of people, but not individuals who they've turned into vampires. Related 10 Interview With A Vampire Secrets Only Book Readers Know 2022's Interview with a Vampire TV series pulls freely from Anne Rice's Lestat stories, but there are still aspects of the books only readers know.\n\nThere is no doubt that The Vampire Diaries' fans love a lot of the supernatural lore that the show provides. The witches are one of the highlights of the entire show. However, the show often sidelines the weaknesses of vampires in a way that sometimes comes off as plot armor. TVD vampires can walk in the sun due to the help of witches and even build up an immunity to vervain. While these weaknesses are challenged in the show, Interview with the Vampire makes sure that these obstacles are ironclad.\n\nThe show is mostly set at night, save for a few daytime scenes in the present day with Daniel Molloy. There have not been workarounds for vampires to walk in created by witches. What Interview does is showcase a vampire's powers and how they can evolve sans the help of another supernatural being. While the series could benefit from a crossover between another Anne Rice adaptation, Mayfair Witches, the series has so far been vampire-centric.\n\nThis means the vampires do not have to share the screen with other creatures. TVD incorporated a lot of interesting supernatural lore, but that also meant sacrificing the main monster: vampires. TVD introduced witches, ghosts, immortals, sirens, and the Devil himself. As of now, Interview with the Vampire has stayed in the realm of vampires. Another difference between the two shows is how TVD has a slight stakes issue. TVD has a habit of bringing back characters from the dead, effectively making most deaths lacking in drama. What Interview with the Vampire does is create high stakes and has, so far, maintained this throughout the first season.\n\nThe series is not afraid of shedding blood and covering dark topics, which should definitely intrigue TVD viewers. Death and consequences are more permanent in Interview. Fans who might wonder why Damon does not face consequences for his treatment of Caroline might find comfort in knowing that Interview makes sure every action made in the show has repercussions.\n\nInterview with the Vampire TV-MA HorrorDramaFantasy\n\nBased on Anne Rice's iconic novel, follow Louis de Pointe's epic story of love, blood and the perils of immortality, as told to the journalist Daniel Molloy.\n\nRelease Date October 2, 2022 Cast Jacob Anderson , Sam Reid , Bailey Bass , Eric Bogosian Main Genre Horror Seasons 2 Studio AMC Studios Creator Rolin Jones Main Characters Louis de Pointe du Lac - Ancient vampire grappling with his conscience and humanity.

Get a sneak peek at the final episode of the AMC series.\n\nInterview With the Vampire Season 2 makes its highly anticipated return to AMC on Sunday, May 12 at 9/8c on AMC. While waiting for the new episodes, fans have been wondering if Season 2's episode release schedule will follow suit with Season 1, which aired new episodes on AMC+ days earlier than the cable channel. TV Insider has learned that this will change with Season 2. Here's everything we know.\n\nInterview With the Vampire Season 1 aired on Sundays at 9/8c on the AMC cable channel starting in October 2022, but the episodes were available on Fridays for AMC+ subscribers. TV Insider can confirm that will not be the case for the upcoming season. New episodes of Interview With the Vampire Season 2 will air on Sundays at 9/8c on AMC as planned, and the new episodes will be available on AMC+ on Sundays as well. The first two episodes were made available on AMC+ on the series premiere date in 2022, but that's not likely to happen again with Season 2.\n\nWhile an exact time of AMC+ availability was not provided, it's commonplace for some streaming services to make new episodes available at the same time that the episode airs on its network. This is the case for HBO shows, which become available to stream on Max at the same time the episode airs, making it so that cable subscribers and cable cutters alike can have the collective experience of watching the show as it airs.\n\nWith the anticipation behind Interview With the Vampire's second season, it makes sense that AMC would want to prevent spoilers from being spread across the internet by not debuting the new episodes days in advance. A show of this quality should be weekly appointment viewing anyway!\n\nAMC experimented with temporarily licensing Interview With the Vampire out to Max in 2023. Season 1, along with select seasons of other AMC original series, was included in the \"AMC+ Picks on Max\" collection from September 1 through Halloween 2023. This gave Interview With the Vampire a second wind of popularity, bringing the series to all-new audiences and growing the fanbase. Given that this was during the Hollywood strikes, it was a perfect time to try and get new eyes on AMC's excellent catalog.\n\nInterview With the Vampire Season 2 stars Jacob Anderson (Louis), Sam Reid (Lestat), Delainey Hayles (the new Claudia), Assad Zaman (Armand), Eric Bogosian (Daniel), and Ben Daniels (Santiago). Guest stars include Justin Kirk in a mystery role, Roxane Duran as Madeleine, Bally Gill as \"Real Rashid,\" and Breaking Bad's David Costabile as Leonard.\n\nHere's the logline for Season 2: The interview continues in Season 2. \"In the year 2022, the vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac (Anderson) recounts his life story to journalist Daniel Molloy (Bogosian). Picking up from the bloody events in New Orleans in 1940 when Louis and teen fledgling Claudia (Hayles) conspired to kill the Vampire Lestat de Lioncourt (Reid), Louis tells of his adventures in Europe, a quest to discover Old World Vampires and the Theatre Des Vampires in Paris, with Claudia. It is in Paris that Louis first meets the Vampire Armand (Zaman). Their courtship and love affair will prove to have devastating consequences both in the past and in the future, and Molloy will probe to get to the truths buried within the memories.\"\n\nSeason 1 had seven episodes, but Season 2 will have eight. As this is billed as \"Part 2,\" the episode numbers at the beginning of each installment will start at \"Episode 8\" and go up from there.

To read the last entry, check out How Dead Boy Detectives Carved Out Its Own World in the Sandman Universe.\n\nThe AMC series Interview with the Vampire didn't so much burst onto the scene in 2022 as it did saunter into the conversation. It hit in October, meaning it went up against the weekly releases of heavy hitters like The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, House of the Dragon, and The Boys, and a large hunk of the general audience wasn't even aware of AMC+ yet. I'm a strong proponent for the majority of the shows the Anne Rice adaptation went up against, of course, but I am also here to tell you that AMC's Interview with the Vampire absolutely rips -- sometimes literally -- and that it's well past time for you to check it out.\n\nWhile the series adapts the same book that the film of the same name did back in 1994, it does so with its own spin while still acknowledging the original, fateful interview with (very human) reporter Daniel Malloy (played by Christian Slater in the film and Eric Bogosian in the current series). Louis de Pointe du Lac is now played by a Black man (Jacob Anderson) -- meaning that he is very much not the plantation owner formerly described, but a brothel owner instead (the reason for the former fabrication is explained in-story). And his origins aren't the only thing he changed from his first interview with Malloy back in '94.\n\nThis contemporary continuation/retelling revitalizes Rice's original story from 1976 in ways that I never anticipated. Playing both in the past and the present is always fun -- especially when the present in the story reflects current times -- but I don't know that anyone was quite ready for just how hard this new chapter of Interview with the Vampire goes. From the cast, to the story, to the gore, to the subtext becoming, well... text, there isn't a single area where the series doesn't excel. And I swear that when I wrote the line \"subtext becoming text\" it wasn't intentionally a Buffy the Vampire Slayer reference, Giles just follows me around in life I guess.\n\nWhile the writing and directing of the series are absolutely superb, it's the performances that take Interview with the Vampire to new heights. There is a key reason that brought Louis back into Malloy's life -- one that I won't spoil here in a column telling you to watch for yourself -- and Bogosian's portrayal as something as simple as the confidante archetype elevates Louis' new narration in ways I never would have expected. Meanwhile, Sam Reid is so good as Lestat that he frequently makes me forget that I have hated his character for the entirety of my life. He is just so perfectly bitchy that you can't help but love him, even as the terrible monster he is. Anderson adds a depth to Louis that had otherwise been missing in on-screen adaptations, making him more than a sad sack and bringing new layers to the character with each passing story as he orates to Malloy. And then there's Claudia. Dear, dear Claudia. In Season 1 she is played by Bailey Bass, but the actress had to vacate the role in Season 2 due to scheduling reasons. Delainey Hayles will be taking over this upcoming season, and I am confident that she will elevate the series in her own way.\n\nAnd, listen... in addition to all of that praise, it's also wonderfully gory and hella gay. There's just so much to love here!\n\nWhy am I here telling you that it's time to catch up on Interview with the Vampire before Season 2 hits next week? Because I care about your happiness. And because I want it to get 20 more seasons. But let's pretend that it's mostly the first one.\n\nI can hear you now, with all of your objections. \"Amelia, there's so much TV right now... I can't.\" \"AMC stopped producing good shows after it put all of its focus in The Walking Dead.\" \"I don't have cable anymore.\" All nonsense! Especially now that Season 2 is premiering in May with far less competition than its debut.\n\nOk, I actually think there is a hair of validity to The Walking Dead tidbit (Better Call Saul and Preacher innocent), but Interview with the Vampire is a completely different team and AMC's answer to actively trying to find its next flagship show! So, please know that, as someone who also broke up with The Walking Dead (aggressively), I could not recommend IWTV more. Not all AMC series are created equal! And besides, vampires are the superior undead anyway.\n\nAs for the other two imaginary objections above, it is an undeniable fact that there are too many damn shows right now. However, that means that prioritizing the best of the best should be of the highest importance. I assure you that Interview with the Vampire is just that. I cannot stress how impeccable Season 1 of the series was and, if our Season 2 review is to be believed, there's no sophomore slump in sight for this next chapter.\n\nDon't have cable anymore? Who does?! (I do...) The series streams on AMC+ (It's nine bucks a month and they have a week free trial). And if you're wondering if one show can be enough to justify a streaming service subscription for the duration of a season, I am here to tell you that this one is.\n\nBut why not use that one week free trial to find out for yourself? Now is the perfect time to binge that first season before Season 2 hits on Sunday, May 12. It means you won't have to go through the same agony that the rest of us who watched Season 1 did while we waited for the next part of the story to hit! And if you need one final point to drive home just how exceptional this continuation has been, take into account that the majority of fans who watched the first season know exactly where this story is going thanks to the book and film, but we've been begging for the second season from the moment the credits rolled on the finale of the first.", "source": {"uri": "ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_Pointe_du_Lac", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louis de Pointe du Lac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview_with_the_Vampire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interview with the Vampire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_(TV_channel)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMC (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Rings_of_Power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AMC+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_the_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House of the Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation_complexes_in_the_Southern_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plantation complexes in the Southern United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Anderson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Anderson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Bogosian", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Bogosian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anne Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Slater", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian Slater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IGN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brothel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Back to the Future"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey_Bass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bailey Bass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Reid_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Reid (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lestat_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lestat (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Archetype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Walking Dead (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If...?_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "What If...?

Now, the curtains are rising on the next act -- Interview With The Vampire returns for Season 2 on May 12, not a day too soon for its hungry-for-more fandom.\n\nThings were bloody in 1940 New Orleans when we last left our favorite creatures of the night. Any vitality in the romance between tortured vampire Louis du Pointe du Lac (Jacob Anderson) and his lothario-like kill machine of a lover Lestat de Lioncourt (Sam Reid) had long since been sucked dry. Years of resentment and disagreements -- from their open relationship to the adoption of exuberant yet flailing young Claudia (Delainey Hayles) -- led to Lestat acting out in brutal ways. Left with no other choice, Louis took drastic measures to keep himself and his undead daughter safe, fleeing life on the Bayou for a fresh start abroad.\n\nIf you're anything like us, you've ravenous for more. Tune in to AMC and AMC+ on May 12th, and read on for a taste of what's to come in Season 2.\n\nWith Season 1, this modern adaptation of Anne Rice's immortal saga gave audiences a topical twist on Gothic horror, incorporating themes of queer identity, Blackness, family, cultural crisis, and more.\n\nIt's safe to say that fans of the storied franchise are starving for more. With it, Season 2 brings the answers we've been craving: Love is all-consuming, but is it truly immortal? Can the ghosts of your past follow you across across the oceans wide? How much will our favorite characters endure before they realize that memory is indeed the monster?\n\nThey say Paris is for lovers, and that doesn't just go for humans. The alluring metropolis is a chillingly perfect home for the next chapter of our story. There, a whole new world opens up for Louis and Claudia, one full of beings just like them. Concurrently, in present day Dubai, Louis continues to recount his tale to the no-nonsense journalist Daniel Molloy (Eric Bogosian).\n\nWhen we meet Louis in Paris, he is still staving off his cravings for human flesh with the blood of rats and other quadrupeds. Only now, he walks the night documenting shiftless souls like himself through photography.\n\nMeanwhile in the 9th arrondissement, Claudia discovers her flair for drama when a mysterious stranger turns her onto the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Des Vampires. Masquerading as a late-night cabaret theater for humans, the operation is actually run by a deadly vampire coven. Suddenly, she and Daddy Louis have a community -- not to mention a farm for their feedings.\n\nAcross time and continents, the interview between Louis and Daniel Molloy takes on a new undercurrent. Their connection may be deeper than we first thought, and in this project of unearthing their respective corpses, the truth won't stay buried for long.\n\nIn Paris, our favorite undeads are joined by a whole new coterie of their sharp-toothed kind. Armand (Assad Zaman) is a beautiful vampire and a familiar face from Louis' present-day life who leads the coven behind Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Des Vampires. Just when Louis thought the love of his immortal life had come and gone, a new hottie enters the villa. Also fresh on the scene is Santiago (Ben Daniels), a power-hungry coven member frustrated by Armand's new relationship energy and willing to do almost anything to lay it to rest.\n\nInterview With The Vampire Season 2 premieres May 12 on AMC and AMC+.

It's time we looked back at season one in keen anticipation of the second (and potentially final) season.\n\nCreating a satisfying adaptation of a classic work of fiction is always a thorny and difficult undertaking. It's even harder when said classic is in need of serious revision in order to be retold. That's why it's nothing short of remarkable that AMC's Interview with the Vampire is so good. The show is based on Anne Rice's 1976 novel of the same name and probably most familiar to folks in the form of the 1994 Tom Cruise/Brad Pitt film which, if not precisely good, is certainly iconic as a staple of campy, closeted vampire cinema.\n\nThe novel, film, and series all split their time between the present day -- where journalist Daniel Molloy interviews titular vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac -- and various points in Louis' history, where we learn about his relationship with his abusive, mercurial maker, Lestat de Lioncourt, and their shared ward, the child vampire Claudia. The first season covers, more or less, the first half of the novel, where our vampire protagonists live in New Orleans and try to form a found family before they turn on one another in spectacular fashion.\n\nRevisiting a Problematic Classic\n\nRice's original novel is, perhaps, the defining work of the era of the sympathetic vampire -- wherein vampires become the protagonists of the novels and films in which they appear and are granted motivations beyond bloodlust and conquest. It's a turning point for vampires being reassessed as monsters worthy of our sympathy and a clear path to the era of the heroic vampire which includes Twilight, True Blood, and The Vampire Diaries. It's a masterwork of dark, romantic atmosphere and kinky, sometimes grotesque eroticism (despite containing no sex whatsoever -- more on that later).\n\nIt's also, for all of its importance, not a particularly easy book to translate to the screen. For one thing, in the forty-eight years since its publication, Rice's novel has aged poorly. With the first half of the novel set in New Orleans, there is very little about the city's Black residents, and what does exist is our vampire protagonist Louis du Pointe du Lac's assertion that the enslaved African people he owned during his life had more fighting spirit and were free of the servility that later generations of enslaved Americans adopted. It's a grotesque sentiment and, even if it is offered by an immortal slave owner, Rice doesn't do anything to push back against it. Compare that to George R.R. Martin's Fevre Dream, published just six years later -- another New Orleans-set vampire novel but one which is explicit and thoughtful (if also imperfect) about the thematic relationship between vampirism and chattel slavery.\n\nRice's novel is also difficult to recommend in terms of its relationship to queerness. The romantic tension between Louis and Lestat is an anchoring force in the novel and certainly coded as romantic. But, as mentioned above, for all of the declarations of undying love (in prose that's occasionally quite purple), there is precious little mention of sex, and Louis and Lestat regard one another with the same passion and affection that they hold for Claudia, who I will remind you, exists in an eternally six-year-old body in the book. All that is to say that Rice's novel feels erotic, insinuates a kind of eroticism, and, given its protagonists, implies a sprawling queer romance, but never actually defines the nature of its relationships. It ends up being a closeted queer narrative: the sort of thing that might work well in 1976, and provide some plausible deniability for straight heartthrobs in 1994, but feels deeply lacking -- even irresponsible -- in 2022.\n\nRather than trying to patch up or ignore the original's uncomfortable legacy on race and sexuality, the AMC adaptation does an excellent job of centering both, turning what could be the franchise's biggest liabilities into its strengths. To look at exactly how it does so, we'll have to examine the central ethos of show's approach to adaptation...\n\nThe Vampire Remix\n\nBryan Fuller, the showrunner for the absolutely masterful Hannibal, as well as Pushing Daisies, Dead Like Me, Wonderfalls, and the first season of American Gods, was briefly attached to AMC's Interview with the Vampire series. While it now seems clear that his plan for the series was quite different from what eventually made it to screen, showrunner Rolin Jones' attitude towards adaptation feels nearly identical to his predecessor's much lauded vision for Hannibal.\n\nThat show was described by Fuller as a \"remix\" and was often lovingly deemed a sort of \"fan fiction\" by its most ardent boosters. To my mind, what both labels imply is a sort of adaptation that makes gigantic changes to the plot while staying remarkably consistent when it comes to tone and the overall vibe of the franchise. Hannibal played fast and loose with the events of all four of Thomas Harris' Hannibal Lecter novels, but remixed extant plot points and characters in such a way that the series felt faithful and familiar without strictly being a re-telling of an already multifariously adapted story.\n\nIn Interview with the Vampire this same ethos means that numerous details have been changed but, in nearly all cases, these changes seem to be in the service of making the best parts of Rice's novel feel relevant and thoughtful. With regard to my earlier comments on the novel's shortcomings, the departures are the most stark. Louis is Black (played by Game of Thrones' Jacob Anderson), as is Claudia (played in the first season by Bailey Bass and recast with Delainey Hayles in the second), and their skin color is desperately important to the plot. But it also helps to inform and complicate their original characterizations. Where Rice's Louis can be passive and retiring to a fault -- whiny, even -- Anderson's version of the character is filled with a barely contained rage. His passivity is structurally based in his position as a wealthy Black business owner in New Orleans who must constantly swallow his pride and follow the rules lest he face the wrath of the white supremacist powers that be.\n\nSome of this is also achieved by a shift in the time period. The novel begins its tale in 1791 -- during the height of New Orleans as a center for the transatlantic slave trade. In moving the start date up to 1911 in the show, it allows Louis some modicum of freedom, elides any need to confront Rice's specific commentary on slavery, and, arguably, grounds the series in a more vibrant and interesting era of New Orleans history. The Jazz Age and Great Depression lend an air of excess and subsequent melancholy to the proceedings that either reinforce or stand in stark contrast to Louis and Lestat's troubled romance. The first season's segments set in the past cover 1910 up through about 1940. This means that the show can play at cleverly matching real-life events to the novel's plot points. In Rice's original, Claudia is the orphaned daughter of a plague victim. In the show, she loses her aunt in a fire that is caused by racial violence in 1919, which coincides with the destruction of Storyville where Louis works as a brothel proprietor. Next season seems poised to send Louis and Claudia to Romania in the middle of the second World War and to move its Parisian section from the Belle Epoque of the late 19th century to the mid-1950s.\n\nAnd that brings us to the explicit queerness of the series. There is no ambiguity about Louis and Lestat's relationship in AMC's version. Much like its commentary on race, the show's commentary on sexuality allows historical bigotry to inform the experience of being a vampire -- what does it mean to live forever in a world that never fully acknowledges your personhood, that tolerates you for the supernatural intrigue you connote but still finds you perverse. The first season's final episode, which sees Louis and Lestat lure immortality-hungry mortals to their deaths as a final goodbye to New Orleans. In recollecting it, Louis tells Molloy that there was more scandal over the two of them openly dancing together than from the murders later that evening, saying \"So much would be written about that grim night in New Orleans but not a single mention of our last hour at Latrobe's. As if the only crime unfit to print took place on that dance floor.\" Making Rice's implications text, ironically, allows a story that has always been about closeted sexuality to be told in more painful, present, and thoughtful terms.\n\nBut more than Louis and Lestat's relationship being merely acknowledged, it's allowed to be messy and, at times, monstrous. The novel's Lestat is full of rage and behaves abysmally, but in the hands of actor Sam Reid, he becomes a fascinating comment on relative privilege. Rice's vampires, living in the shadows, wary of attention, unable to survive without murdering someone every day are often portrayed as pitiable -- hunted, haunted. Reid's Lestat is no exception to this, but the show uses the contrast between himself and Louis to further discuss and explore race. After killing a racist lawyer, much to Lestat's consternation, Louis declares \"There's some things you don't get about America.\" He draws out the differences between them: \"Colored, white. Creole, French. Queer, half-queer, mostly-queer, what is it?\" To this, Lestat replied \"non-discriminating.\" Both in terms of race and sexuality, Lestat is able to pass in the human world and the show uses that passing privilege to drive a wedge between our protagonists. No longer is Louis' reluctance to drink human blood or his general temerity presented as merely a difference in character (though the show certainly insinuates that Louis is less unhinged and less intrinsically cruel than Lestat) but, in large part, as a response to a world in which he is infinitely more vulnerable.\n\nThe final major departure from the books involves the aging up of Claudia. Anne Rice famously lost her five-year-old daughter to leukemia while working on Interview with the Vampire and supposedly had a prophetic dream prior to the diagnosis in which she learned her daughter was dying of something \"wrong with her blood.\" Claudia, the forever six-year-old vampire of the book has always been theorized to be, in part, the result of that grieving process. She is one of Rice's most compelling characters -- monstrous, tragic, and deeply unsettling. But having a six-year-old who becomes an adult without ever physically aging is a challenge for a screen adaptation. Kirsten Dunst was cast in the '94 film at age eleven and even that near-doubling of the character's age still ended up being problematic, with the adult Dunst commenting on the discomfort she felt having to kiss the then-thirty-year-old Pitt on set. Bailey Bass, was nineteen when she played Claudia in the first season and looks young enough to match the character's age -- now fourteen rather than six or eleven.\n\nThe age-up absolutely changes Claudia -- but in many ways, it changes her for the better. The mix of being trapped in a prepubescent-looking body while being old enough to fully understand the adult world she has been robbed of gives the character a rage that never feels impotent or infantilized. A child's lack of empathy has been replaced in the show by a teenager's unhinged chaos and it proves equally scary. Bass played Claudia with a magnetic, discomfiting mixture of piercing wisdom and giggling, teary-eyed malice that will absolutely be missed. It's a performance that a child actor would struggle to capture and aging her up allows the show to treat her as a co-equal, shouldering much of the series' dramatic weight. I am excited to see what Delainey Hayles will bring to the character next season, but she has some truly impressive shoes to fill.\n\nThe Odyssey of Recollection\n\nThis is a show that's in love with its source material and also careful and thoughtful about updating it. But it has another secret weapon in reflecting on the nature of adaptation: a real dedication to the titular interview. In Rice's original book (and it's 1994 adaptation), Daniel Molloy is an aspiring journalist who lucks into an interview with Louis. Both the book and the film treat Molloy's interview as taking place sometime around each property's release. The show, rather cannily, posits that there are, in fact, two interviews. The first one takes most of the events of the novel as canon with the interview occurring in San Francisco in 1973 and Molloy being a young reporter (and, in this series, strung out on heroin). But we only see bits and pieces of that interview (the one from the novel), largely towards the end of the season. Most of what comprises the interview portion of the AMC series is an interview set in 2022 with a much older Molloy (played, in the present, by Talk Radio's Eric Bogosian, looking and sounding more and more uncannily like Anthony Bourdain) now a cantankerous Pulitzer Prize winner who is dying of Parkinson's and seeking redemption for a life of professional success at the cost of personal fulfillment.\n\nBogosian's Molloy is the heart of the series. More than being a framing device, as he was in both book and film, he serves as a meta-textual commentator on the story being told. At numerous points he questions Louis' story, in part identifying what sounds like overly trope-y genre fiction, calling Louis and Lestat's relationship \"a fucked-up Gothic romance.\" At another point, when we see Lestat potentially inspire a young Jelly Roll Morton, Molloy rolls his eyes at Louis for implying that it was a white man who wrote Morton's famous \"Wolverine Blues.\"\n\nBeyond being a winking presence, providing a necessary ameliorative to the gorgeous but overwrought narration that Louis uses to tell his tale (occasionally cribbed directly from Rice's often transcendent prose), Molloy begins to push back on whether or not Louis' story is true and whether or not it is being told with self-serving embellishments. Louis attempts to reconcile the changes between these two tellings by invoking one of Molloy's own phrases, \"the Odyssey of memory\": the process by which recollection distorts the event. But, as Molloy works his way through primary sources, reading through Claudia's diaries, a pattern emerges. Parts of the record that conflict with Louis' telling of events are missing. When Claudia is sexually assaulted, the pages detailing her feelings on the matter have been neatly cut out of the diary. Louis claims it is out of respect for her -- to keep private the traumas she recorded in confidence. But Molloy points out that what Louis has actually done is silence her and editorialize on what should and should not be shared.\n\nAll of Molloy's research works to make the audience believe that Louis is not telling the whole truth. And this is not just the Louis of the show. In presenting a second interview that calls into question the first, the show is able to imply that many of its departures from the novel are not retcons so much as they are lies told to the younger and more naive Molloy. This culminates in the reveal at the very end of season that Louis' valet, Rashid (Assad Zaman) is, in fact, the vampire Armand, a major character from the second half of the novel (played with remarkable gusto by Antonio Banderas in the '94 film). Nothing is what it should be. Armand has been elided from Louis' story and has been watching over both interviews in secret, offering his own edit to Louis, unseen by both Molloy and the audience. The tagline for the second season is \"Memory is the Monster\" and what little has been shown in trailers implies that Molloy is in danger and Louis may be the cause of it.\n\nInterview with the Vampire is one of the rare shows that improves on its already iconic source material. It's had fifty years to consider how Rice's novel functions and the impressive legacy it has spawned. It has to contend not only with its own source material but with Twilight, True Blood, Castlevania, and the myriad other zeitgeist-defining vampire tales that owe their existence, in part, to the popularity of Rice's books.\n\nIt does so without altering the spirit of the novel and keeping quite a bit of its lush prose intact. It's anchored by four absolutely enthralling (perhaps glamoring?) performances that breathe new, complex life into well-established characters. It's beautifully shot, expertly paced, and incredibly sexy (it makes one question how we ever accepted five years of Jacob Anderson playing a eunuch when this performance was an option). If you haven't seen it, it's absolutely worth your while. If you have, well -- you have just enough time for a rewatch before the second season premieres next week.", "source": {"uri": "reactormag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reactor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If...?_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "What If...?

This is the case for HBO shows, which become available to stream on Max at the same time the episode airs, making it so that cable subscribers and cable cutters alike can have the collective experience of watching the show as it airs.\n\nWith the anticipation behind Interview With the Vampire's second season, it makes sense that AMC would want to prevent spoilers from being spread across the internet by not debuting the new episodes days in advance. A show of this quality should be weekly appointment viewing anyway!\n\nRelatedYou Interviewed the Vampires: Jacob Anderson, Sam Reid & More Answer 'IWTV' Fan Questions\n\nAMC experimented with temporarily licensing Interview With the Vampire out to Max in 2023. Season 1, along with select seasons of other AMC original series, was included in the \"AMC+ Picks on Max\" collection from September 1 through Halloween 2023. This gave Interview With the Vampire a second wind of popularity, bringing the series to all-new audiences and growing the fanbase. Given that this was during the Hollywood strikes, it was a perfect time to try and get new eyes on AMC's excellent catalog.\n\nInterview With the Vampire Season 2 stars Jacob Anderson (Louis), Sam Reid (Lestat), Delainey Hayles (the new Claudia), Assad Zaman (Armand), Eric Bogosian (Daniel), and Ben Daniels (Santiago). Guest stars include Justin Kirk in a mystery role, Roxane Duran as Madeleine, Bally Gill as \"Real Rashid,\" and Breaking Bad's David Costabile as Leonard.\n\nHere's the logline for Season 2: \"In the year 2022, the vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac (Anderson) recounts his life story to journalist Daniel Molloy (Bogosian). Picking up from the bloody events in New Orleans in 1940 when Louis and teen fledgling Claudia (Hayles) conspired to kill the Vampire Lestat de Lioncourt (Reid), Louis tells of his adventures in Europe, a quest to discover Old World Vampires and the Theatre Des Vampires in Paris, with Claudia. It is in Paris that Louis first meets the Vampire Armand (Zaman). Their courtship and love affair will prove to have devastating consequences both in the past and in the future, and Molloy will probe to get to the truths buried within the memories.\"\n\nJacob Anderson as Louis and Delainey Hayles as Claudia in Interview With the Vampire Season 2 Episode 1 (Larry Horricks / AMC)\n\nInterview With the Vampire Season 2 Release Schedule\n\nSeason 1 had seven episodes, but Season 2 will have eight.

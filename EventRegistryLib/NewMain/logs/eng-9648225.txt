Najmul Hossain Shanto, the Bangladesh captain, described it as a match they \"should have won.\"\n\nDespite missing that opportunity, they face a crucial upcoming encounter against the Netherlands, a team also with two points from two matches. A victory here could significantly boost Bangladesh's chances of joining South Africa in the Super 8s.\n\nThe Netherlands have experienced missed opportunities against South Africa. They had Aiden Markram's team struggling at 12/4 but couldn't counter David Miller's composed innings. However, given Bangladesh's vulnerabilities, the Netherlands see this match as a more attainable goal in their quest to advance to the second round.\n\nThis Netherlands side is filled with experience and could end up on the winning side against Bangladesh.

Bangladesh will take on the Netherlands in a crucial Group D clash at Kingstown on Thursday. Bangladesh is in second place in Group D with a win and a loss, giving them two points. The Netherlands is in third place in the group with a win and loss too. Both teams are in contention for a spot in the Super Eight stage of the tournament.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the game at the pre-match press conference, Shanto said, \"Yeah, as I said, we played some good cricket here. And we are very much confident that the team we have this time, if we play with our strength, we should go to Super Eights.\" Questioned on a narrow four-run loss to South Africa in their previous match, the skipper said that such things happen in cricket and the team is happy with its performances.\n\n\"And here we had a very good practice session today. A little bit hot but the boys are already adjusted and I hope we will have a very good match,\" he added. Shanto said that no one in the team is worried about the form of all-rounder Shakib al Hasan. The veteran has contributed just 97 runs and six wickets in his last eight T20Is.\n\n\"It is important to know how much he expects than the expectations of the people. He is trying his best and working hard. I would not say he will come back. He is in a good condition already. I hope he will deliver well tomorrow,\" he continued. He also clarified that there is nothing wrong with Shakib's eyes and he is practicing well in the nets.\n\n\"Just one or two innings can go wrong in this format. I do not feel any pressure as a captain. And I know that he also does not feel any pressure. Because he has a lot of experience, I think he will have a good comeback,\" added Shanto. Shanto also said that he has liked the support from the crowd so far and hopes that they will turn up for this game too.\n\nSpeaking on the team's batting performance, he said that Litton Das and Towhid Hridoy are among the players doing well. \"I never expect that all seven batsmen will play well. I want the batsman who is getting set whether he's from the top or middle order, should finish the game. Of course, it is good if it is coming from the top. But I want the batsmen who are getting set to finish the game,\" he added.\n\nShanto also said that conditions in Kingstown are a lot better than in New York and Texas, but the wind is a challenge. \"So, there is a little help for the bowlers, from what I understood after batting here. I hope that we will play in a good wicket tomorrow but we don't know yet. We will adjust whatever the wicket is and try to play,\" he concluded.\n\nSquads: Netherlands Squad: Michael Levitt, Max ODowd, Vikramjit Singh, Sybrand Engelbrecht, Bas de Leede, Scott Edwards(w/c), Teja Nidamanuru, Logan van Beek, Tim Pringle, Paul van Meekeren, Vivian Kingma, Saqib Zulfiqar, Aryan Dutt, Kyle Klein, Wesley Barresi\n\nBangladesh Squad: Tanzid Hasan, Najmul Hossain Shanto(c), Litton Das(w), Shakib Al Hasan, Towhid Hridoy, Mahmudullah, Jaker Ali, Rishad Hossain, Taskin Ahmed, Tanzim Hasan Sakib, Mustafizur Rahman, Mahedi Hasan, Tanvir Islam, Shoriful Islam, Soumya Sarkar.

The game is scheduled to be played on Thursday (June 13) at the Arnos Vale Ground, Kingstown, St Vincent.\n\nBoth the teams are coming into this game after suffering close losses to South Africa in their previous group game. Netherlands suffered a six-wicket defeat while defending 104 runs against the Proteas. They had South Africa reeling at 3 for 3 and then 12 for 4 but the score was too low to defend against one of the most dominating teams in the competition.\n\nOn the other hand, Bangladesh were agonisingly close to registering their first-ever win over South Africa in the shortest format of the game. Chasing 114 runs, the Bangla Tigers needed 10 runs from the final over bowled by left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj. The South Africa star bowled three full tosses in the over but Bangladesh still failed to clear the boundary and ended up losing the game by 4 runs.\n\nThe win sealed South Africa's spot in the Super 8s and the other teams are now fighting out for the remaining one spot. Of the four teams in contention, Netherlands and Bangladesh are slightly ahead and the winner of the upcoming game between the two will be on the verge of qualification.\n\nBangladesh will be facing Nepal in their final league and will be fancying their chances of making it to the next round. On the other hand, Netherlands are set to take on Sri Lanka and a loss against Bangladesh could very well put an end to their chances of progressing ahead of the group stage.\n\nTanzid Hasan, Litton Das (wk), Najmul Hossain Shanto (c), Towhid Hridoy, Shakib Al Hasan, Jaker Ali, Mahmudullah, Rishad Hossain, Taskin Ahmed, Tanzim Hasan Sakib, Mustafizur Rahman\n\nMichael Levitt, Max O'Dowd, Vikramjit Singh, Sybrand Engelbrecht, Scott Edwards (c & wk), Bas de Leede, Teja Nidamanuru, Logan van Beek, Tim Pringle, Paul van Meekeren, Vivian Kingma\n\nBangladesh:\n\nTanzid Hasan, Najmul Hossain Shanto(c), Litton Das(w), Shakib Al Hasan, Towhid Hridoy, Mahmudullah, Jaker Ali, Rishad Hossain, Taskin Ahmed, Tanzim Hasan Sakib, Mustafizur Rahman, Mahedi Hasan, Tanvir Islam, Shoriful Islam, Soumya Sarkar\n\nNetherlands:\n\nMichael Levitt, Max ODowd, Vikramjit Singh, Sybrand Engelbrecht, Bas de Leede, Scott Edwards(w/c), Teja Nidamanuru, Logan van Beek, Tim Pringle, Paul van Meekeren, Vivian Kingma, Saqib Zulfiqar, Aryan Dutt, Kyle Klein, Wesley Barresi\n\nBangladesh and Netherlands have faced each other four times in T20Is so far and the former have the upper hand in this rivalry. Of the four games between the two teams, Bangladesh have won three while Netherlands have emerged victorious in one.\n\nMustafizur Rahman has looked in good rhythm with the ball in the ongoing T20 World Cup. After a good campaign in this year's IPL, he has hit the ground running in the ongoing competition. In the first game against Sri Lanka, the left-arm pacer picked up 3 wickets for just 17 runs. He could not take any wicket against South Africa but conceded only 18 runs in his 4 overs.\n\nLogan van Beek:\n\nLogan van Beek is coming into this game on the back of a fine outing against South Africa in the last game. He impressed with both bat and ball to keep his team in the hunt for an upset. With the bat, van Beek played a crucial 23-run knock that helped Netherlands cross the 100-run mark. With the ball, he picked up 2 wickets for 21 runs.\n\nTanzim Sakib is having a fine outing in the ongoing T20 World Cup. In 2 games so far, he has picked up 4 wickets. After taking one wicket in the opening game against Sri Lanka, the right-arm pacer picked up 3 wickets for just 18 runs in the previous game against South Africa.\n\nTowhid Hridoy:\n\nTowhid Hridoy is fast becoming the backbone of Bangladesh's T20I team. The youngster has impressed one and all with his remarkable composure in the pressure situation and will be looking to impress again. He scored 40 against Sri Lanka before playing a crucial knock of 37 runs against South Africa.\n\nTeam India will start the game as favourites and are expected to win the forthcoming game against USA.", "source": {"uri": "sportzwiki.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportzwiki"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakib_Al_Hasan", "type": "person", "score": 5,

Speaking at a pre-match press conference, Van Beek said the preparations had been good for them before their fixture against Bangladesh and added that the players were relaxed.\n\n\"This is the biggest match that we're probably going to play for this tournament. And so, the preparations have been very nice. We've stayed at a very nice hotel in Sandals (St. Vincent). The boys have been relaxed. We've been by the beach. We've been in the waters. We've done some sunset cruises. We had a great training yesterday. Today's our first time at the ground, and it looks like it's in wonderful shape. The practice wickets have been great and I think tomorrow's match is going to be one that the island has waited a long time for - but it's great to have cricket back in St. Vincent,\" Van Beek said. In the Group D standings, the Netherlands hold the third place with two points. The Dutch side won just one game in the tournament against Nepal. They are coming into this match after suffering a 4-wicket loss against South Africa.\n\nMeanwhile, Bangladesh are coming into this match after facing a four-run defeat against the Proteas. They are in second place on the Group D points table after having just one win against Sri Lanka.

Bangladesh and the Netherlands were in the hunt for the second qualifying spot from the Group with South Africa assured their place in the Super Eight with three wins in three matches. By winning the match on Thursday, Bangladesh areShakib hammered 64 not out off 46 balls to propel Bangladesh to 159/5 in 20 overs. Later, the Bangla Tigers defended the target with Rishad Hossain claiming 3-33 and Taskin Ahmed bagging 2-30 as the Netherlands were restricted to 132/8 in 20 overs at the Arnos Vale Ground, Kingstown, St Vincent.\n\n.Each of the top five in the Netherlands batting order reached double figures, with the match seemingly in the balance for long stretches of their reply. But wickets fell too frequently for the Dutch to sustain their required run-rate, and their attempt fizzled out with the target still 25 runs away at the close. Some clever pace-off bowling by Bangladesh ensured that the run rate never felt under control.\n\nThe Netherlands were off to a bad start in their chase of 160 as they lost Michael Levitt (15) to Taskin Ahmed in the fifth over with the score at 22. Max O'Dowd too departed soon for 12, caught by Tanzim Hasan off his own bowling.\n\nVikramjit Singh (28) and Sybrand Engelbracht (33) took the score to 69 before the former was out. Engelbrecht and skipper Scott Edwards (25) took the score to 110 before the former was out to Rishad Hossain. The Dutch fight ended when Edwards was out to Mustafizur Rahman for 25 off 23 balls as the Netherlands fell short by 25 runs.\n\nEarlier, a superb unbeaten 64 from 46 balls by Shakib Al Hasan helped Bangladesh reach a decent first innings score of 159/5, with helpful contributions from Tanzid Hasan (35), Mahmudullah (25), and Jaker Ali (14 not out). Shakib struck nine boundaries during his 74-minute stay at the crease, adding 41 runs for the fifth wicket stand with Mahmudullah.\n\nThe Dutch struck the first blow after winning the toss and opting to bowl first following a short rain delay. Aryan Dutt proved tricky to get away in the Powerplay, picking up the wickets of Najmul Hossain Shanto and Litton Das, with the latter falling to an outrageous catch by Sybrand Engelbrecht.\n\nA fiery partnership between Tanzid Hasan (35 from 26) and Shakib Al Hasan saw Bangladesh accelerate towards a competitive score. Paul van Meekeren stemmed the flow of the runs when he had Tanzid caught in the deep, and Tim Pringle struck to remove a bogged-down Towhid Hridoy (9 from 15) as pace off proved the most effective option for the Dutch on a sticky surface.\n\nBrief scores:\n\nBangladesh 159/5 in 20 overs (Shakib Al Hasan 64 not out, Tanzid Hasan 35, Mahmudullah 25; Aryan Dutt 2-17, Paul van Meekeren 2-15) beat Netherlands 134/8 in 20 overs (Sybrand Engelbrecht 33, Vikramjit Singh 26, Scott Edwards 25; Rishad Hossain 3-33, Taskin Ahmed 2-30) by 25 runs.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType":

AP\n\nBangladesh vs Netherlands, T20 World Cup Group D match Preview: Bangladesh face Netherlands at Kingstown, St Vincent in a match that could have a major influence on the team joining South Africa in the T20 World Cup Super 8s from Group D.\n\nBoth Bangladesh and Netherlands sit on two points each, winning one and losing one so far in their campaign. Both teams were beaten by South Africa -- the Dutchmen suffering a four-wicket defeat after posting 103 on the board and the Bangla Tigers falling four runs short after South Africa posted 113/6.\n\nBoth teams had collected a win in Dallas before losing to South Africa in New York. While Netherlands defeated Nepal by six wickets, Bangladesh pulled off a thrilling two-wicket win over Sri Lanka.\n\nWhile the team winning the upcoming match will not seal their place in the Super 8s, they certainly will have the upper hand heading into their final group match of the tournament.\n\nA washout, however, will keep Sri Lanka's faint hopes of reaching the second round alive. The Lankans lost their first two matches before collecting their first point of the campaign with a washout against Nepal.\n\nFor them to reach the next round, not only will they need the Bangladesh-Netherlands match to end in a washout, they will also need to defeat Netherlands in their final Group D match while hoping Nepal defeat Bangladesh.\n\nSquads:\n\nNetherlands: Michael

Bangladesh is in second place in Group D with a win and a loss, giving them two points. The Netherlands is in third place in the group with a win and loss too. Both teams are in contention for a spot in the Super Eight stage of the tournament.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the game at the pre-match press conference, Shanto said, \"Yeah, as I said, we played some good cricket here. And we are very much confident that the team we have this time, if we play with our strength, we should go to Super Eights.\"\n\nQuestioned on a narrow four-run loss to South Africa in their previous match, the skipper said that such things happen in cricket and the team is happy with its performances.\n\n\"And here we had a very good practice session today. A little bit hot but the boys are already adjusted and I hope we will have a very good match,\" he added.\n\nShanto said that no one in the team is worried about the form of all-rounder Shakib al Hasan. The veteran has contributed just 97 runs and six wickets in his last eight T20Is.\n\n\"It is important to know how much he expects than the expectations of the people. He is trying his best and working hard. I would not say he will come back. He is in a good condition already. I hope he will deliver well tomorrow,\" he continued.\n\nHe also clarified that there is nothing wrong with Shakib's eyes and he is practicing well in the nets.\n\n\"Just one or two innings can go wrong in this format. I do not feel any pressure as a captain. And I know that he also does not feel any pressure. Because he has a lot of experience, I think he will have a good comeback,\" added Shanto.\n\nShanto also said that he has liked the support from the crowd so far and hopes that they will turn up for this game too.\n\nSpeaking on the team's batting performance, he said that Litton Das and Towhid Hridoy are among the players doing well.\n\n\"I never expect that all seven batsmen will play well. I want the batsman who is getting set whether he's from the top or middle order, should finish the game. Of course, it is good if it is coming from the top. But I want the batsmen who are getting set to finish the game,\" he added.\n\nShanto also said that conditions in Kingstown are a lot better than in New York and Texas, but the wind is a challenge.\n\n\"So, there is a little help for the bowlers, from what I understood after batting here. I hope that we will play in a good wicket tomorrow but we don't know yet. We will adjust whatever the wicket is and try to play,\" he concluded.\n\nSquads:\n\nNetherlands Squad: Michael Levitt, Max ODowd, Vikramjit Singh, Sybrand Engelbrecht, Bas de Leede, Scott Edwards(w/c), Teja Nidamanuru, Logan van Beek, Tim Pringle, Paul van Meekeren, Vivian Kingma, Saqib Zulfiqar, Aryan Dutt, Kyle Klein, Wesley Barresi\n\nBangladesh Squad: Tanzid Hasan, Najmul Hossain Shanto(c), Litton Das(w), Shakib Al Hasan, Towhid Hridoy, Mahmudullah, Jaker Ali, Rishad Hossain, Taskin Ahmed, Tanzim Hasan Sakib, Mustafizur Rahman, Mahedi Hasan, Tanvir Islam, Shoriful Islam, Soumya Sarkar.

In their second match against the Proteas, they had a terrible day with the bat as they could only score 103-9 in 20 overs.

This eagerly anticipated encounter is set for 13th June 2024, with the action beginning at 8:00 PM IST.\n\nBoth teams are vying for the crucial second spot in Group D, making this match a high-stakes affair. Bangladesh's campaign began on a positive note with a victory over Sri Lanka, but they faltered in their second game, suffering a defeat at the hands of South Africa. Despite this setback, they currently hold the second position in the group standings.\n\nSimilarly, the Netherlands have experienced a rollercoaster start to their tournament. They opened with a win against Nepal but were subsequently defeated by South Africa in their second match. Like Bangladesh, they are striving to solidify their place in the group by clinching the second position.\n\nWith both teams showcasing resilience and competitive spirit, the upcoming match promises to be a thrilling contest as they battle for a pivotal spot in the tournament. Fans can expect a hard-fought game with both sides eager to bounce back from their recent losses and make a strong push towards the knockout stages.\n\nThe pitch at Arnos Vale Ground in Kingstown, St. Vincent, is known for its slow nature, making it one of the slower surfaces in the Caribbean. Batters often find it challenging to score substantial totals here. The slow pitch favors spinners, who can extract significant turn and bounce, making it conducive for them to spin the ball effectively. The average first-innings score at this ground is around 140 to 150 runs. Teams winning the toss typically choose to bat first.\n\nTanzid Hasan, Litton Das(w), Najmul Hossain Shanto(c), Towhid Hridoy, Shakib Al Hasan, Jaker Ali, Mahmudullah, Rishad Hossain, Taskin Ahmed, Tanzim Hasan Sakib, Mustafizur Rahman\n\nMichael Levitt, Max ODowd, Vikramjit Singh, Sybrand Engelbrecht, Scott Edwards(w/c), Bas de Leede, Teja Nidamanuru, Logan van Beek, Tim Pringle, Paul van Meekeren, Vivian Kingma\n\nLitton Das could be the best batter in the upcoming game against the Dutch. The right-hand opener looked in good touch in their previous fixture but couldn't play a significant knock and he would be eager to showcase his prowess with the bat in the upcoming game.\n\nCheck Here: T20 World Cup 2024 Most Runs\n\nTaskin Ahmed could be the best bowler in the upcoming fixture courtesy of his ability to bowl with brisk pace and bounce.

One fan asked the men in green to do their bit while the fans do theirs, with a placard reading: \"You play, we pray\" during their match against South Africa.\n\nThe Netherlands are also aware of the importance of the clash and their bowler Logan van Beek said the team have had \"very nice\" preparations ahead of it.\n\n\"This is the biggest match that we are probably going to play for this tournament,\" van Beek said.\n\nHe said he expects the wicket to be flat, with no dents but the ground still has plenty of \"unknowns\" for both sides.\n\nThe men in orange are confident of bagging an important win over their group rivals.\n\n\"The confidence that we've got over the last few years of beating big teams at big competitions and in do-or-die matches, we've stood up at right times and that's how the Dutch play. We kind of find ourselves in these do-or-die matches all year round and so we're used to that pressure and excited to do it again.\"\n\nThe Arnos Vale Stadium has plenty of unknowns surrounding it as it has not hosted an international cricket match in 10 years. In the past, the pitch has produced an even contest between bat and ball, with spinners finding plenty of success.\n\nWhile there is no rain forecast, weather conditions will be typically hot and humid.\n\nThe two sides have met four times in the T20 format. Bangladesh have won three of those matches, including the most recent one at the T20 World Cup 2022.\n\nThe only T20 win for the Netherlands against Bangladesh came in 2012.\n\nBoth sides have won one each and lost one game - against South Africa - in the tournament so far.\n\nBangladesh have relied on their power-hitting batters and calm lower-order veteran Mahmudullah to see them through with the bat. Rishad Hossain has also played an invaluable role with the ball.\n\nThe Netherlands have been tidy with the ball and excellent on the field. All they need is for their batting to step up a gear.\n\nBangladesh: L W W L L\n\nNetherlands: L W L L L\n\nShak Mahedi Hasan could be in line for his first T20 World Cup game, as his tidy off-break bowling and batting abilities could come in handy in the Caribbean.\n\nSquad: Najmul Hossain Shanto (captain), Taskin Ahmed, Litton Das, Soumya Sarkar, Tanzid Hasan Tamim, Shakib Al Hasan, Tawhid Hridoy, Mahmudullah Riyad, Jaker Ali Anik, Tanvir Islam, Shak Mahedi Hasan, Rishad Hossain, Mustafizur Rahman, Shoriful Islam, Tanzim Hasan Sakib.\n\nThey are unlikely to change their playing

Netherlands won their opening game against Nepal by a six-wicket margin and then reduced South Africa to 12 for 4 in their defence of 103 before David Miller and Tristan Stubbs took them home.

In their second match against the Proteas, they had a terrible day with the bat as they could only score 103-9 in 20 overs.

It will be added when there is an update.\n\nWhat are the Fantasy Cricket Top Picks, Players for BAN vs NED, ICC T20 World Cup 2024, Group D, Match 27?\n\nTop Pick - Batter\n\nTowhid Hridoy's application was on point in the first two matches of the tournament. He played the spin well against Sri Lanka to score 40 runs and stood strong against a quality South African seaming attack, adding valuable 37 runs.\n\nTop Pick - All-Rounder\n\nLogan van Beek is having a great time with the ball for the Netherlands in the ICC T20 World Cup 2024, picking up 5 wickets in 2 matches with the best figures of 3 for 18 and scoring 23 runs with the bat in an innings.\n\nTop Pick - Bowler\n\nPlaying in his first T20 World Cup, Tanzim Hasan Sakib hasn't shown any nerves at all and already picked up 4 wickets in 2 matches including the career-best T20I figures of 3 for 18.\n\nTop Pick - Wicketkeeper\n\nLitton Das is a good pick for your fantasy teams as he bats higher up the order. He scored 45 runs in 2 matches in the tournament with the highest score of 36.\n\nX-Factor:\n\nShakib Al Hasan hasn't put up his best show yet in the tournament having made only 11 runs and went wicketless in 2 matches. He is a world-class all-round and hoping for a better show in this match.\n\nWhat are the Fantasy Suggested teams for BAN vs NED, ICC T20 World Cup 2024, Group D, Match 27?\n\n1. Litton Das, Max O'Dowd, Towhid Hridoy (vc), Michael Levitt, Shakib Al Hasan, Sybrand Engelbrecht, Logan van Beek (c), Bas de Leede, Rishad Hossain, Mustafizur Rahman, Tanzim Hasan Sakib\n\n2. Scott Edwards, Najmul Hossain Shanto, Towhid Hridoy, Shakib Al Hasan, Sybrand Engelbrecht, Logan van Beek, Bas de Leede (c), Rishad Hossain (vc), Taskin Ahmed, Vivian Kingma, Mustafizur Rahman\n\nPre-Match Analysis:\n\nBangladesh tried everything to overcome mighty South Africans in their previous game on tough Nassau County conditions but unfortunately lost the contest by a narrow 4-run margin. Credit to the bowling group for restricting the Proteas to a score of 113 where pacers Tanzim Hasan Sakib and Taskin Ahmed bowled in tandem to pick 5 wickets between them. The chase was very much on despite the loss of wickets at regular intervals where Towhid Hridoy and veteran Mahmudullah kept them in the game, scoring 37 and 20 runs respectively. Gotta feel sad for Mahmudullah who was caught at the long off boundary region when 6 runs were required from the last 2 deliveries.\n\nEarlier in the tournament they beat Sri Lanka by 2 wickets to get themselves off the mark. Now they will travel to different part of the world and expect results to go in their favor. Currently, they are placed 2nd in the Group D standings with 2 points.\n\nNetherlands started their journey with a 6-wicket win over Nepal but failed to capitalize on that, losing to South Africa by 4 wickets in the follow-up. They didn't walk off without putting up a fight and pushed South Africa to work hard for their win. Sybrand Engelbrecht top scored for the Dutch with 40 against his country of origin. With late contributions from Logan van Beek, they got to a respectable total of 103. They were charged up early on while defending the modest target, picking up 4 wickets for just 12 runs but a 65-run stand from between Tristan Stubbs and David Miller took the game away from them. Vivian Kingma and Logan van Beek were exceptional with the ball, picking up 2 wickets apiece.\n\nThey share the same 2 points with Bangladesh but with a lesser run rate, they occupy 3rd position in the Group D standings. Max O'Dowd (56 runs) and Sybrand Engelbrecht (54 runs) are the in-form batters and all eyes will be on Logan van Beek who has picked up 5 wickets in the last 2 matches.", "source": {"uri":

Bangladesh won critical two points in Group D, strengthening their position in second place on the rankings. Veteran Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Ak Hasan and young leg-spinner Rishad Hossain collaborated on Thursday to keep the team alive in the tournament.\n\nThe Netherlands were in it for a while but Bangladesh proved too strong in the end. The match was in the balance at the stage when Netherlands needed 56 off 36 with 7 wickets in hand, but things fell apart for them with the wicket of Sybrand Engelbrecht (33) who was looking good in the middle.\n\nFor Bangladesh, Hossain remained composed even after getting a few hits and picked up three crucial wickets, including the big one of Engelbrecht. Mustafizur Rahman was simply sensational with the ball and the bowlers conceded just 12 runs in his entire spell, bagging one wicket.\n\nChasing a target of 160, the Netherlands struggled to use the Powerplay and lost both openers with little on the board. Vikramjit and Sybrand Engelbrecht worked together to keep the ship stable, but the former left just when he was becoming hazardous.\n\nThen skipper Scott Edwards took charge and supported Sybrand Engelbrecht, who was smashing the boundaries. The Netherlands got them into a good position, but then lost two wickets in the same over, putting them behind again. Skipper's wicket was the final nail in the coffin for the Netherlands as they could not recover from the batting collapse.\n\nEarlier, Shakib Al Hasan's brilliant unbeaten 64* from 46 balls enabled Bangladesh to reach a respectable score of 159/5, with contributions from Tanzid Hasan (35), Mahmudullah (25) and Jaker Ali (14), after the Dutch opted to field first.\n\nThe Dutch relied on pace, with off-spinner Aryan Dutt (2/17 in 4 overs) and medium-pacer Paul van Meekeren (2/15 in 4) proving to be their most efficient bowlers.\n\nDutt proved tricky to get away in the Powerplay, taking up the wickets of Najmul Hossain Shanto and Litton Das, the latter succumbing to an incredible catch by Sybrand Engelbrecht.\n\nThe game came to a brief standstill for a helmet check after a bouncer lodged in the grill of Tanzid Hasan, who rapidly rushed to touch the wedged ball into the turf to prevent any potential controversy over the chance of getting 'caught' when it was removed.\n\nA furious partnership between Tanzid Hasan (35 from 26) and Shakib Al Hasan propelled Bangladesh to a competitive score. Paul van Meekeren slowed the pace of the runs when he caught Tanzid in the deep, and Tim Pringle struck to remove a well-set Towhid Hridoy, as spin proved the most successful tactic for the Dutch on a sticky surface. Shakib's brilliant unbeaten 64* from 46 balls enabled Bangladesh to reach a respectable score of 159/5.\n\nBrief score: Bangladesh 159/5 (Shakib Al Hasan 64*, Tanzid Hasan 35; Aryan Dutt 2-17) vs Netherlands 134/8 (Sybrand Engelbrecht 33, Vikramjit Singh 26; Rishad Hossain 3-33).

Netherlands won the toss and chose to bowl first. Aryan Dutt made an early inroad for the Dutch by dismissing Najmul Shanto and Litton Das. Shakib Al Hasan and Tanzid Hasan then built a crucial partnership of 48 runs for the third wicket.\n\nTanzid was eventually out after scoring 35 off 26 balls, while Shakib continued to toil with Mahmudullah joining him. After the departure of Towhid Hridoy, the pair combined for a 41-run stand, guiding Bangladesh to a competitive total. Mahmudullah scored 25 off 21 before getting out, while Shakib remained unbeaten on 64 off 46. Jaker Ali also contributed a quick 14 runs off seven deliveries, helping the Tigers reach a total of 159 for 5.\n\nDuring their chase, the Netherlands' openers, Micheal Levitt and Max ODowd, had a shaky start. They scored 18 and 12 runs respectively, with the team managing just 36 runs in the powerplay. Vikramjit Singh and Sybrand Engelbrecht then put together a 37-run partnership before Vikramjit was dismissed for 26 off 16 balls. Sybrand continued to score well, supported by captain Scott Edwards, as they added 42 runs between them.\n\nBoth Sybrand and Edwards departed after scoring 33 and 25, respectively. Rishad Hossain was brought in by Bangladesh and made crucial breakthroughs by dismissing Bas de Leede and Logan van Beek. With 36 runs needed off 12 deliveries, the Netherlands' lower-order batters struggled. Bangladesh managed to tackle them effectively and secured a 25-run victory in the T20 World Cup 2024 encounter. This win kept Bangladesh's hopes alive for the Super 8 stage.\n\nThe first and foremost task at Netherlands hand is to win the remaining game with a comprehensive margin.

The right-arm quick's short ball got big on Levitt who attempted to cut the ball but couldn't connect properly and Towhid Hridoy took the catch.\n\nMax O'Dowd, who steered the Netherlands to a victory against Nepal, struck three boundaries but a brilliant return catch from Tanzim saw the back of the opener.\n\nVikramjit Singh (26 off 16) took a liking to spin coming into him as he smashed three sixes to provide the much-needed acceleration.\n\nIt prompted Najmul Hossain Shanto to bring back off-spinner Mahmudullah to take the ball away from Singh and the move worked immediately for Bangladesh. Singh was deceived in flight by Mahmudullah and Litton did the stumping.\n\nSybrand Engelbrecht and Scott Edwards then forged a partnership to get the Netherlands in front.\n\nShakib Al Hasan's first half-century since October 2022 helped Bangladesh set a target of 160 for the Netherlands in a crucial T20 World Cup match at the Arnos Vale Stadium in Kingstown.\n\nShakib hit nine fours as he returned to form with a masterful 64* off 46.\n\nBangladesh had the worst possible start against the Netherlands in a crucial T20 World Cup clash as their captain Najmul Hossain Shanto gifted his wicket early, much to the delight of the Dutch.\n\nThe Tigers stuck to the all-left hander combination of openers despite the prospect of facing off-spinner Aryan Dutt early. Shanto went for the reverse sweep first up and hit the ball straight to first slip.\n\nLitton went for the sweep early in his innings off Dutt, trying to take advantage of the positive match-up, but Sybrand Engelbrecht took an absolute screamer to dismiss the Bangladesh number three.\n\nTanzid and Shakib, despite losing the openers, played their natural game. The Netherlands tried to attack them by short-pitched bowling but the duo was equal to the task.\n\nBangladesh scored 54 runs for the loss of two wickets in the powerplay despite an unfavourable start.\n\nShakib, in particular, got going with a 19-run over off pacer Logan van Beek. He played cut and pull shots in that over against short balls, his nemesis lately.\n\nTanzid, on the other hand, was the first to counterattack. After his captain Shanto's dismissal, the southpaw took down Vivian Kingma and played the opponent's best bowler Dutt fairly well. He hit five fours and a six in his vital knock.\n\nBut the short ball worked in the end for the Netherlands and Paul van Meekeren as Tanzid (35 off 26) pulled the ball, but not with conviction, and lost his wicket.\n\nThe left-handed duo added 48 off just 32 balls.\n\nTowhid Hridoy was tied down by the Netherlands spinners and in the end he was cleaned up by Tim Pringle as he shaped for a cut shot in a delivery too close to cut. Hridoy's dismissal left Bangladesh in a spot of bother at 89-4 in the 13th over.\n\nBangladesh struggled to hit the older ball and the scoring rate was under a run-a-ball in the middle phase (7-15) and they needed some big overs to go past the 150-run mark.\n\nMahmudullah (25 off 21) and Jaker Ali struck a few lusty blows before Shakib's array of cheeky shots in the final over to take Bangladesh

Bangladesh started off their campaign with a nervy win over Asian rivals Sri Lanka before losing to South Africa by just four runs in their last match. A win against the Netherlands will surely put Bangladesh back in contention for a place in Group D but it would not be easy task. Batting was their weaker link in that loss to South Africa and the defeat, which was just by four runs, prompted fans to call for a law change that denied Bangladesh a boundary. Bangladesh will take a lot of confidence from the way they bowled against South Africa and will look to emulate that form against the Netherlands.

After Das swept Dutt towards square leg, Engelbrecht covered a lot of ground and dived full-length to pull off the catch.\n\nThe shot Das played was also unnecessary given that Tanzid Hasan had picked up two boundaries and a six in the previous over. For the maximum, Tanzid danced down the ground and flayed it over covers.\n\nThe only change in the Dutch line-up for this vital Group D match, Dutt vindicated the team management's decision by returning excellent figures of 2/17 in his full quota of four overs. Paul van Meekeren (2/15) was also brilliant with the ball.\n\nAs many as 18 came off the fourth over bowled by Vivian Kingma and Bangladesh were on their way.\n\nStruggling for form prior to this game, Shakib collected four boundaries in the sixth over, which yielded 19 runs, as Bangladesh reached 54 for two at the end of powerplay.\n\nMeanwhile, Tanzid tried to hit van Meekeren against the wind and paid the price, holing out to Bas de Leede in the outfield.\n\nBangladesh's two most experienced players, Mahmudullah and Shakib then added 41 runs for the fourth wicket to prop up the team.\n\nHowever, as the innings entered its final stretch, Mahmudullah, having hit two sixes and two furs, was done in by the strong wind as Engelbrecht completed another good catch near the ropes.",

After Das swept Dutt towards square leg, Engelbrecht covered a lot of ground and dived full-length to pull off the catch.\n\nThe shot Das played was also unnecessary given that Tanzid Hasan had picked up two boundaries and a six in the previous over. For the maximum, Tanzid danced down the ground and flayed it over covers.\n\nThe only change in the Dutch line-up for this vital Group D match, Dutt vindicated the team management's decision by returning excellent figures of 2/17 in his full quota of four overs. Paul van Meekeren (2/15) was also brilliant with the ball.\n\nAs many as 18 came off the fourth over bowled by Vivian Kingma and Bangladesh were on their way.\n\nStruggling for form prior to this game, Shakib collected four boundaries in the sixth over, which yielded 19 runs, as Bangladesh reached 54 for two at the end of powerplay.\n\nMeanwhile, Tanzid tried to hit van Meekeren against the wind and paid the price, holing out to Bas de Leede in the outfield.\n\nBangladesh's two most experienced players, Mahmudullah and Shakib then added 41 runs for the fourth wicket to prop up the team.\n\nHowever, as the innings entered its final stretch, Mahmudullah, having hit two sixes and two furs, was done in by the strong wind as Engelbrecht completed another good catch near the ropes.

The right-arm quick's short ball got big on Levitt who attempted to cut the ball but couldn't connect properly and Towhid Hridoy took the catch.\n\nMax O'Dowd, who steered the Netherlands to a victory against Nepal, struck three boundaries but a brilliant return catch from Tanzim saw the back of the opener.\n\nVikramjit Singh (26 off 16) took a liking to spin coming into him as he smashed three sixes to provide the much-needed acceleration.\n\nIt prompted Najmul Hossain Shanto to bring back off-spinner Mahmudullah to take the ball away from Singh and the move worked immediately for Bangladesh. Singh was deceived in flight by Mahmudullah and Litton did the stumping.\n\nSybrand Engelbrecht and Scott Edwards then forged a partnership to get the Netherlands in front.\n\nEarlier, Shakib Al Hasan's first half-century since October 2022 helped Bangladesh set a target of 160 for the Netherlands.\n\nShakib hit nine fours as he returned to form with a masterful 64* off 46.\n\nBangladesh had the worst possible start against the Netherlands in a crucial T20 World Cup clash as their captain Najmul Hossain Shanto gifted his wicket early, much to the delight of the Dutch.\n\nThe Tigers stuck to the all-left hander combination of openers despite the prospect of facing off-spinner Aryan Dutt early. Shanto went for the reverse sweep first up and hit the ball straight to first slip.\n\nLitton went for the sweep early in his innings off Dutt, trying to take advantage of the positive match-up, but Sybrand Engelbrecht took an absolute screamer to dismiss the Bangladesh number three.\n\nTanzid and Shakib, despite losing the openers, played their natural game. The Netherlands tried to attack them by short-pitched bowling but the duo was equal to the task.\n\nBangladesh scored 54 runs for the loss of two wickets in the powerplay despite an unfavourable start.\n\nShakib, in particular, got going with a 19-run over off pacer Logan van Beek. He played cut and pull shots in that over against short balls, his nemesis lately.\n\nTanzid, on the other hand, was the first to counterattack. After his captain Shanto's dismissal, the southpaw took down Vivian Kingma and played the opponent's best bowler Dutt fairly well. He hit five fours and a six in his vital knock.\n\nBut the short ball worked in the end for the Netherlands and Paul van Meekeren as Tanzid (35 off 26) pulled the ball, but not with conviction, and lost his wicket.\n\nThe left-handed duo added 48 off just 32 balls.\n\nTowhid Hridoy was tied down by the Netherlands spinners and in the end he was cleaned up by Tim Pringle as he shaped for a cut shot in a delivery too close to cut. Hridoy's dismissal left Bangladesh in a spot of bother at 89-4 in the 13th over.\n\nBangladesh struggled to hit the older ball and the scoring rate was under a run-a-ball in the middle phase (7-15) and they needed some big overs to go past the 150-run mark.\n\nMahmudullah (25 off 21) and Jaker Ali struck a few lusty blows before Shakib's array of cheeky shots in the final over to take Bangladesh to 159-5.", "source": {"uri": "tbsnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Business Standard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishad_Hossain", "type": "person",

On the other hand, Bangladesh have fielded their unchanged playing XI for the game.\n\nTeja had a disappointing outing against South Africa in the last game. Batting at number seven, he failed to create an impact as he was dismissed for a duck.

The strategic move paid off instantly as Dutt claimed the big wicket of Bangladesh skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto (1).\n\nShanto's dismissal was largely due to poor shot selection as he attempted an unnecessary reverse sweep, resulting in a catch at the first slip.\n\nDutt struck again at the beginning of the fourth over, thanks to a stunning catch in the deep by Sybrand Engelbrecht. Litton Das's sweep towards square-leg was brilliantly intercepted by Engelbrecht, who covered significant ground to secure a diving catch.\n\nDas' shot was deemed unnecessary, especially after Tanzid Hasan had just picked up two boundaries and a six in the previous over. Tanzid had showcased his aggression by dancing down the pitch and lofting a maximum over the covers.\n\nDutt, being the only change in the Dutch lineup for this crucial Group D match, justified his selection with excellent figures of 2 for 17. Paul van Meekeren also impressed with the ball, taking 2 for 15.\n\nBangladesh accelerated with a productive 18-run fourth over bowled by Vivian Kingma.\n\nShakib, struggling for form before this game, found his rhythm and smashed four boundaries in the sixth over, which yielded 19 runs, taking Bangladesh to 54 for two by the end of the powerplay.\n\nIn an attempt to keep the momentum, Tanzid Hasan tried to hit van Meekeren against the wind but ended up holing out to Bas de Leede in the outfield.\n\nBangladesh's two most experienced players, Mahmudullah and Shakib, then added 41 runs for the fourth wicket, stabilizing the innings.\n\nHowever, as the innings approached its final phase, Mahmudullah, having hit two sixes and two fours, was caught near the ropes by Engelbrecht, struggling against the strong wind.\n\nEngelbrecht's second solid catch highlighted the fielding efforts that kept the Dutch in contention for large parts of the game.\n\nPoints Table | Schedule\n\nDespite the Dutch bowlers applying pressure, Bangladesh's middle order, spearheaded by Shakib's assuring knock, managed to build a competitive total that proved too challenging for the Netherlands to chase down.\n\nThis performance by Bangladesh not only strengthened their chances of advancing in the tournament but also showcased a balanced team effort with both bat and ball.\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

Netherlands won the toss and opted to bowl first. Aryan Dutt, who was picked in the playing XI for the game, struck early as he sent Najmul Shanto and Litton Das back to the pavilion. Shakib Al Hasan and Tanzid Hasan stitched a much-needed partnership of 48 runs for the third wicket.\n\nTanzid departed after scoring 35 off 26 as Shakib kept searching for more runs with support from Mahmudullah. After Towhid Hridoy departed, the duo put up a 41-run stand to steer Bangladesh to a formidable total. Mahmudullah's innings ended on 25 off 21 and Shakib remained unbeaten on 64 off 46. Jaker Ali's unbeaten little cameo of 14 runs in seven balls saw the Tigers posting 159 for 5 on the board.\n\nWhile chasing, Michael Levitt and Max O'Dowd faltered after a decent start. The duo scored 18 and 12 respectively as Netherlands fetched just 36 runs in powerplay. Vikramjit Singh and Sybrand Engelbrecht joined hands for a 37-run partnership before Vikramjit trudged back scoring 26 off 16. Sybrand got able support from the captain Scott Edwards as both batters added 42 runs between them.\n\nWhile Sybrand scored 33 off 22, Edwards had to end his stay on 25 off 23. Rishad Hossain was brought in by Bangladesh and he ended Netherlands hopes by picking Bas de Leede and Logan van Beek. With 36 needed off 12 deliveries, the tailenders had little to offer. Bangladesh managed to contain them comprehensively and won the game by 25 runs.

After Das swept Dutt towards square leg, Engelbrecht covered a lot of ground and dived full-length to pull off the catch.\n\nThe shot Das played was also unnecessary given that Tanzid Hasan had picked up two boundaries and a six in the previous over. For the maximum, Tanzid danced down the ground and flayed it over covers.\n\nThe only change in the Dutch line-up for this vital Group D match, Dutt vindicated the team management's decision by returning excellent figures of 2/17 in his full quota of four overs. Paul van Meekeren (2/15) was also brilliant with the ball.\n\nAs many as 18 came off the fourth over bowled by Vivian Kingma and Bangladesh were on their way.\n\nStruggling for form prior to this game, Shakib collected four boundaries in the sixth over, which yielded 19 runs, as Bangladesh reached 54 for two at the end of powerplay.\n\nMeanwhile, Tanzid tried to hit van Meekeren against the wind and paid the price, holing out to Bas de Leede in the outfield.\n\nBangladesh's two most experienced players, Mahmudullah and Shakib then added 41 runs for the fourth wicket to prop up the team.\n\nHowever, as the innings entered its final stretch, Mahmudullah, having hit two sixes and two furs, was done in by the strong wind as Engelbrecht completed another good catch near the ropes.

Shakib Al Hasan's timely return to form (64* off 46) and Rishad Hossain (3-33) continuing his fine bowling show in this tournament helped Bangladesh defend a total of 159. Meanwhile, with the game yielding a result, Sri Lanka were knocked out of contention for the next stage of the competition.\n\nWhat made the difference?\n\nBangladesh's death overs batting and Rishad Hossain's fine spell. Bangladesh had managed only 105 in 15 overs before they upped the ante in the death. A steady half-century from Shakib Al Hasan and cameos from Mahmudullah and Jaker Ali helped them pick up 54 runs in the last five overs. The Netherlands chase looked solid until Rishad's strikes in his last two overs changed the complexion of the game, and the ever-reliable Mustafizur Rahman didn't give an inch.\n\nBANGLADESH\n\nPowerplay: Bangladesh positive despite early wickets\n\nPhase score - 54/2 [RR: 9.00, 4s/6s: 8/1]\n\nThe decision to bring in Aryan Dutt in place of Teja Nidamanuru paid off for the Netherlands as the offspinner had Najmul Hossain Shanto caught off a reverse sweep in the second over. After a quiet start, Tanzid Hasan got going with a six and two fours off Vivian Kingma in an 18-run third over. Litton Das's attempted slogsweep resulted in Dutt bagging his second wicket, thanks to a sensational catch from Sybrand Engelbrecht who sprinted, put in the dive and held on to the ball with outstretched hands. Tanzid Hasan, meanwhile, continued to be positive, pulling Dutt for a four and Shakib Al Hasan also got into the act with a cover drive for a boundary off Paul van Meekeren. Shakib took on Logan van Beek in the sixth over, scoring four boundaries, as the 19-run overpowered Bangladesh to their third highest powerplay score in T20 World Cups.\n\nMiddle overs: Netherlands pull things back\n\nPhase score: 51/2 [RR: 5.66, 4s/6s: 5/0]\n\nTanzid struck two fours off Bas de Leede in his opening over but after a quiet over from Dutt, the opener was dismissed by van Meekeren looking to pull against the wind. The Netherlands did well to bring down the scoring rate, conceding only 22 in the four overs after the powerplay. Shakib hit a four off Tim Pringle but Dutt continued to keep it tight, giving away only five off his last over to finish with 2 for 17. Pringle then accounted for the wicket of Towhid Hridoy as Bangladesh slipped to 89/4. Shakib and Mahmudullah picked up a four apiece but the Netherlands kept the scoring rate in check in the middle overs.\n\nDeath overs: Shakib fifty, cameos ensure a positive finish\n\nPhase score: 54/1 [RR: 10.80; 4s/6s: 2/6]\n\nShakib slowed down as he neared his fifty but Mahmudullah ensured Bangladesh did not lag in the death overs, striking a six off van Beek, followed by a six and a four off Pringle. Shakib eventually reached his first fifty in his last 20 T20I innings but van Meekeren bagged the important wicket of Mahmudullah and conceded only four runs in the 18th over. But there were five boundaries struck in the last two overs - three by Jaker Ali off van Beek in the 19th and two by Shakib off de Leede in the 20th - with 26 runs coming off them.\n\nNETHERLANDS\n\nPowerplay: Bangladesh keep Netherlands in check\n\nPhase score - 36/2 [RR: 6.00, 4s/6s: 6/1]\n\nMichael Levitt and Max O'Dowd helped the Netherlands make a steady start in the chase, with the former playing the aggressor's role as he struck 2 fours and a six in the first four overs. Levitt also survived a direct hit but he eventually departed, slicing a catch to point off Taskin Ahmed in the fifth over. O'Dowd then managed two fours but his outing ended in the sixth over when Tanzim Hasan Sakib held on to the ball that was smashed back at him. Engelbrecht ended the over with a four but the run-rate of six meant the Netherlands had a lot of work to do.\n\nMiddle overs: Netherlands make good progress\n\nPhase score - 75/3 [RR: 8.33, 4s/6s: 5/4]\n\nVikramjit Singh took a liking to the spinners, striking two sixes in an over off Shakib before clearing the fence off Rishad Hossain. Engelbrecht provided good support from the other end as they put on a brisk 37 run stand but that came to an end when Vikramjit was stumped off Mahmudullah in the 10th over. In the same over, Scott Edwards struck a four as the Netherlands moved to 73/3 at the halfway stage of the innings, only two less than what Bangladesh had managed at the same stage for the same number of wickets. The Netherlands edged ahead slightly, thanks to Engelbrecht's six and a four off Shakib and Edwards's regular boundaries. But Rishad provided a double strike in the 15th over, getting Engelbrecht and de Leede in quick succession to continue the game of cat and mouse.\n\nDeath overs: Rishad, Mustafizur deliver victory\n\nPhase score - 23/3 [RR: 4.60, 4s/6s: 1/1]\n\nWith 49 needed for the Netherlands off the last five overs, Shakib delivered an important over, conceding only five runs in the 16th. The pressure got to skipper Edwards who looked to swipe an off-cutter from Mustafizur across the line but got a top-edge. The left-armer also gave away only one run, leaving the Dutch with an uphill task of getting 43 in three overs. Rishad added van Beek's scalp and despite being hit for a six by Dutt, he finished with good figures. The Netherlands needed 36 off the last two but fell well short of the target, with Mustafizur conceding only 12 runs from his 4 overs.\n\nBrief scores: Bangladesh 159/5 in 20 overs (Shakib Al Hasan 64*, Tanzid Hasan 35; Paul van Meekeren 2-25, van Meekeren 2-17) beat Netherlands 134/8 in 20 overs (Sybrand Engelbrecht 33, Vikramjit Singh 26; Vikramjit Singh 3-33, Taskin Ahmed 2-30) by 25 runs.\n\nWhat next for the teams?\n\nNetherlands' net run rate has entered the negative and has left them with a must-win situation, needing a big victory at that, when they take on Sri Lanka in St Lucia on June 16, and also hope that Bangladesh lose their last game. On the same day, Bangladesh face off against Nepal in St Vincent and a win will guarantee them a Super 8 berth immaterial of the Netherlands-Sri Lanka result.", "source": {"uri": "cricbuzz.com",

overs.\n\nChasing the target, the Netherlands were on a promising track in terms of run rate despite losing wickets at regular intervals.\n\nThey had short but crucial partnerships in between but Bangladesh did well to bounce back in the death overs, giving no chance to the Scott Edwards-led side to score freely.\n\nSybrand Engelbrecht was the top run-getter for his side, having scored 33 runs

Shanto went for the reverse sweep first up and hit the ball straight to first slip.\n\nLitton went for the sweep early in his innings off Dutt, trying to take advantage of the positive match-up, but Sybrand Engelbrecht took an absolute screamer to dismiss the Bangladesh number three.\n\nTanzid and Shakib, despite losing the openers, played their natural game. The Netherlands tried to attack them by short-pitched bowling but the duo was equal to the task.\n\nBangladesh scored 54 runs for the loss of two wickets in the powerplay despite an unfavourable start.\n\nShakib, in particular, got going with a 19-run over off pacer Logan van Beek. He played cut and pull shots in that over against short balls, his nemesis lately.\n\nTanzid, on the other hand, was the first to counterattack. After his captain Shanto's dismissal, the southpaw took down Vivian Kingma and played the opponent's best bowler Dutt fairly well. He hit five fours and a six in his vital knock.\n\nBut the short ball worked in the end for the Netherlands and Paul van Meekeren as Tanzid (35 off 26) pulled the ball, but not with conviction, and lost his wicket.\n\nThe left-handed duo added 48 off just 32 balls.\n\nTowhid Hridoy was tied down by the Netherlands spinners and in the end he was cleaned up by Tim Pringle as he shaped for a cut shot in a delivery too close to cut. Hridoy's dismissal left Bangladesh in a spot of bother at 89-4 in the 13th over.\n\nBangladesh struggled to hit the older ball and the scoring rate was under a run-a-ball in the middle phase (7-15) and they needed some big overs to go past the 150-run mark.\n\nMahmudullah (25 off 21) and Jaker Ali struck a few lusty blows before Shakib's array of cheeky shots in the final over to take Bangladesh to 159-5.", "source": {"uri": "tbsnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Business Standard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakib_Al_Hasan", "type":

Despite a competitive performance from the Dutch, Bangladesh's solid all-around play sealed their victory.\n\nBangladesh emerged victorious in this Group D clash, edging closer to the Super 8s with a crucial win over the Netherlands by 25 runs. The Dutch were competitive for much of the match but faltered in the final five overs with both bat and ball.\n\nChasing a target of 160, the Netherlands had a steady start. Michael Levitt and Max O'Dowd put up 22 for the first wicket before Levitt fell for 18. Tanzim Hasan Sakib then dismissed O'Dowd (12) in the last over of the powerplay, leaving the scoreboard at 36/2 after six overs. Vikramjit Singh attacked the spinners with a quickfire 26 off 16 balls before being stumped in the 10th over. Skipper Scott Edwards and Sybrand Engelbrecht then played positively, forming a 42-run partnership for the fourth wicket.\n\nThe turning point came in the 15th over when Rishad Hossain dismissed Engelbrecht (33) and Bas de Leede (0). Edwards (25) was out in the 17th over, and the lower-order batters failed to contribute significantly, ending their innings at 134/8. All six Bangladeshi bowlers, except Shakib Al Hasan, took wickets, with Rishad Hossain claiming three.\n\nEarlier, Bangladesh, after being asked to bat first, had a shaky start. Skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto (1) and Litton Das (1) fell cheaply to Aryan Dutt inside the powerplay. Tanzid Hasan played some elegant strokes and, with support from Shakib Al Hasan, added 48 runs before Tanzid (35) was dismissed in the ninth over. Towhid Hridoy (9) had a short stay at the crease.\n\nShakib Al Hasan anchored the innings from one end, with Mahmudullah Riyad (25) hitting some big shots before being caught in the deep. Shakib reached his fifty and, along with Jaker Ali (14*), provided a strong finish for the Bangla Tigers. Shakib remained unbeaten on 64 off 46 balls, helping Bangladesh post a total of 159/5. Aryan Dutt and Paul van Meekeren each took two wickets for the Netherlands, but their batters could not chase down the target, falling short by 25 runs.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakib_Al_Hasan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shakib Al Hasan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishad_Hossain", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rishad Hossain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikramjit_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vikramjit Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzim_Hasan_Sakib", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tanzim Hasan Sakib"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bas_de_Leede", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bas de Leede"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Edwards_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scott Edwards (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stumped", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stumped"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_O'Dowd", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max O'Dowd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryan_Dutt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aryan Dutt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najmul_Hossain_Shanto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Najmul Hossain Shanto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaker_Ali", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaker Ali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_van_Meekeren", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul van Meekeren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liton_Das", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liton Das"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmudullah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mahmudullah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crease_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crease (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towhid_Hridoy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Towhid Hridoy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Straight_Edge", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Straight Edge", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static-ai.asianetnews.com/images/01j092njjfxhxjeq78psdqkhkb/bangladesh-cricket-board.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648225", "eventUri": "eng-9648225", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

I am happy for him.\"\n\nBangladesh started their campaign with a two-wicket win over Sri Lanka before suffering an agonising four-run loss to South Africa.\n\nThe Dutch also went into Thursday's game with two points after defeating Nepal by six wickets before losing to South Africa by four wickets.\n\n\"We lost in all three facets today. Credit to Bangladesh, they were great and we weren't up to it,\" said crestfallen Dutch skipper Scott Edwards.\n\nOff-spinner Aryan Dutt was drafted into the Dutch side in place of Teja Nidamanuru and repaid his team's faith by taking the first two Bangladesh wickets to fall.\n\nHe sent back Shanto (one) and Liton Das (one) to have the Tigers wobbling at 23-2.\n\nShakib and Tanzid steadied the ship with a 48-run partnership for the third wicket.\n\nMahmudullah added a valuable late 25 runs off 21 balls with two fours and a pair of sixes with Bangladesh taking 54 off the last five overs.\n\nThe Dutch were in a decent position at 111-3 in reply with Michael Levitt (18), Max O'Dowd (12) and Vikramjit Singh (26) all reaching double figures.\n\nSingh's runs came off 16 balls and featured three sixes.\n\nHowever, when Sybrand Engelbrecht's entertaining 33 off 22 balls ended in the 15th over, Dutch hopes faded.\n\nBas de Leede (nought), Edwards (25) and Logan van Beek (two) all fell in the space of six runs as they tried to force the pace.\n\nLeg-spinner Rishad Hossain was the pick of the Bangladesh bowlers with 3-33 from his four overs.\n\nIn their final group game, Bangladesh face Nepal who still harbour Super Eights hopes of their own if they defeat the Tigers and Sri Lanka.\n\nSo far four teams have booked their spots in the Super Eights -- South Africa, India, West Indies and Australia.\n\ndj/nr\n\nMore from this section\n\nThe Latest: White House cancels scheduled press briefing after Hunter Biden conviction\n\nDrug-Free World and the Church of Scientology Denmark Set

The Dutch won the toss and elected to field first. While Bangladesh come into the game with the same XI that faced South Africa, Netherlands made one crucial change by bringing in Aryan Dutt in place of Teja Nidamanuru.\n\nThe Dutch began the innings well, dismissing the opposition captain Najmul Hossain Shanto in the second over itself for 1(3). Litton Das joined the other opener Tanzid Hasan who took the onus to score runs quickly. Litton Das did not get much of a strike and when he did he tried to slog sweep the off spinner Dutt for a six towards deep square leg. The ball, however, gained more height than distance and was intercepted by Sybrand Engelbrecht who was running in from behind square. The catch was no ordinary as Engelbrecht had to cover a considerable amount of ground and dive full length to his left to grab a stunning catch.\n\nThe celebrations that followed reflected how good the catch was and uplifted the Dutch as the score read 23/2 in 3.1 overs.\n\nAlso Read: Why Teja Nidamanuru is not playing T20 World Cup 2024 Match 27 between Bangladesh vs Netherlands?\n\nTanzid was subsequently joined by Shakib Al Hasan who has been having his own issues with short deliveries this tournament. Both put on an important partnership of 48(32) before Tanzid was caught by Bas de Leede off Paul van Meekeren in the deep in the ninth over. Towhid Hridoy could not do much as he was bowled by Tim Pringle comprehensively for 9(15). Mahmudullah joined Shakib and the veterans put on 41 runs for the fifth wicket in 32 balls. Mahmudullah perished off Van Meekeren's delivery at 130/5 in 17.3 overs.

Taskin Ahmed removed the former, while Tanzim Hasan Sakib picked up the latter.\n\nThe Dutch overcame their early troubles as Engelbrecht and Vikramjit Singh added 37 off 23 balls for the third wicket before the latter fell to Mahmudullah for 26.\n\nThen, Engelbrecht, with his skipper Scott Edwards, stitched the innings, sharing 42 off 31 balls in the next stand, and looked comfortable as they eyed their first win over the Tigers in T20 World Cups.\n\nHowever, Rishad shattered that dream as he dismissed Engelbrecht in the fourth delivery of the 15th over, and then struck again to dismiss Bas de Leede for a duck as Liton Das came up with a brilliant stumping.\n\nMustafizur then joined the party to dismiss Edwards, tricking him into giving a catch to Jaker Ali for 25.\n\nThe left-handed pacer ended the game with 17 dot balls out of his 24 balls, aiding Bangladesh to restrict Netherlands to 134-8, with Taskin picking up his second wicket on the final delivery of the match.\n\nEarlier, being sent in to bat, the Bangladesh opening stand failed once again as skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto gifted his wicket to Dutt by trying to reverse sweep, which saw him giving a catch to Vikramjit Singh at slip for just one.\n\nLiton then fell to a stunning catch by Engelbrecht at deep square leg for a single to Dutt, leaving the Tigers reeling at 23-2 in 3.1 overs.\n\nHowever, they bounced back as Shakib and Tanzid Hasan Tamim added 48 runs off 32 balls for the third wicket.\n\nThe duo came up with regular boundaries as Shakib smashed Logan van Beek for four fours in the sixth over, resulting in Bangladesh finishing the powerplay on 54-2.\n\nHowever, Tanzid fell on 35 when he tried to pull van Meekran but only managed to give a catch at deep square leg to de Leede.\n\nShakib, who underwent

Both teams lost close battles to South Africa but also had two points each on the board. With the Proteas already through to the Super 8 stage from Group D, and Sri Lanka and Nepal languishing at the bottom, it was an opportunity to take a big step towards qualification.\n\nIt was Bangladesh who held their nerves in the end to close out a 25-run victory. After an unbeaten half-century from Shakib Al Hasan took them to 159/5, a three-wicket haul by leg-spinner Rishad Hossain ensured the Dutch were restricted to 134/8.\n\nALSO READ: Brian Lara breaks Pakistan hearts by predicting early T20 World Cup exit for Babar Azam's men: 'My money is on USA'\n\nNetherlands were off to a strong start in the chase as Michael Levitt and Max O'Dowd hit a string of boundaries. Despite the openers falling in quick succession, Vikramjit Singh kept the momentum going and struck Shakib for consecutive sixes. The left-hander perished for a 16-ball 26 before Sybrand Engelbrecht (33 off 22) and skipper Scott Edwards added a 42-run stand for the fourth wicket.\n\nNeeding 49 runs to win off 33 balls with six wickets in hand, the Dutch seemed to be marching towards a famous win. But that's when Hossain removed Engelbrecht and Bas de Leede in a span of three deliveries to set Bangladesh on their way.\n\nMustafizur Rahman got rid of Edwards (25 off 23) soon after and went on to complete a fine spell of 1/12. Hossain (3/33) was the standout bowler as Netherlands could only score 23 runs in the last five overs.\n\nEarlier, the Dutch found themselves in a promising position after opting to bowl as Bangladesh reached 35/2 in five overs.\n\nOff-spinner Aryan Dutt took the new ball and struck with his first ball as skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto played a reverse sweep straight to Vikramjit at slip. Litton Das was also sent packing by Dutt, with Engelbrecht pulling off a sensational running catch in the deep.\n\nShakib, however, took control from there and added a 48-run partnership for the third wicket with opener Tanzid Hasan (35 off 26). The former skipper was confident from the outset and played some typically classy strokes either side of the wicket. He was dismissed for single-digit scores in his first two games but looked fluent this time. He posted a 41-run stand with Mahmudullah (25 off 21) and remained unbeaten on 64 off 46 balls with nine fours.\n\nDutt (2/17) and Paul van Meekeren (2/15 bowled impressive spells but Netherlands were left with too stiff a target in the end.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakib_Al_Hasan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shakib Al Hasan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishad_Hossain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rishad Hossain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lara", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Lara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leg spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikramjit_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vikramjit Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bas_de_Leede", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bas de Leede"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Edwards_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scott Edwards (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafizur_Rahman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mustafizur Rahman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_O'Dowd", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max O'Dowd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryan_Dutt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aryan Dutt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najmul_Hossain_Shanto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Najmul Hossain Shanto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_van_Meekeren", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul van Meekeren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liton_Das", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liton Das"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmudullah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mahmudullah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Off spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/06/13/1600x900/Cricket-WC-2024-T20-SRI-BAN-31_1718303810590_1718303828545.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648225", "eventUri": "eng-9648225", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

by 25 runs on Thursday to edge closer to the second round of the T20 World Cup.\n\nShakib, the 37-year-old former captain, recorded his 13th fifty in the format as Bangladesh made 159-5 in their 20 overs.\n\nShakib went on to finish undefeated on 64 off 46 deliveries having crunched nine fours as international cricket returned to Arnos Vale for the first time in 10 years.\n\nIn reply, the Dutch made 134-8 off their 20 overs.\n\nThe win took the Tigers to four points from three games and ideally placed to join already qualified South Africa in making it out of Group D and into the Super Eights second stage.\n\nOpener Tanzid Hasan was also in the runs, stroking 35 off 26 balls with five fours and one six after Bangladesh were put into bat by the Dutch.\n\nBangladesh started their campaign with a two-wicket win over Sri Lanka before suffering an agonising four-run loss to South Africa.\n\nThe Dutch also went into Thursday's game with two points after defeating Nepal by six wickets before losing to South Africa by four wickets.\n\nOff-spinner Aryan Dutt was drafted into the Dutch side in place of Teja Nidamanuru and repaid his team's faith by taking the first two Bangladesh wickets to fall.\n\nHe sent back skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto (one) and Liton Das (one) to have the Tigers wobbling at 23-2.\n\nShakib and Tanzid steadied the ship with a 48-run partnership for the third wicket.\n\nMahmudullah added a valuable late 25 runs off 21 balls with two fours and a pair of sixes with Bangladesh taking 54 off the last five overs.\n\nThe Dutch were in a decent position at 111-3 in reply with Michael Levitt (18), Max O'Dowd (12) and Vikramjit Singh (26) all reaching double figures.\n\nSingh's runs came off 16 balls and featured three sixes.\n\nHowever, when Sybrand Engelbrecht's entertaining 33 off 22 balls ended in the 15th over, Dutch hopes faded.\n\nBas de Leede (nought), skipper Scott Edwards (25) and Logan van Beek (two) all fell in the space of six runs as they tried to force the pace.\n\nLeg-spinner Rishad Hossain was the pick of the Bangladesh bowlers with 3-33 from his four overs.\n\nIn their final group game, Bangladesh face Nepal who still harbour Super Eights hopes of their own if they defeat the Tigers and Sri Lanka.\n\nSo far four teams have booked their spots in the Super Eights -- South Africa, India, West Indies and Australia.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

After Das swept Dutt towards square leg, Engelbrecht covered a lot of ground and dived full-length to pull off the catch.\n\nThe shot Das played was also unnecessary given that Tanzid Hasan had picked up two boundaries and a six in the previous over. For the maximum, Tanzid danced down the ground and flayed it over covers.\n\nThe only change in the Dutch line-up for this vital Group D match, Dutt vindicated the team management's decision by returning excellent figures of 2/17 in his full quota of four overs. Paul van Meekeren (2/15) was also brilliant with the ball.\n\nAs many as 18 came off the fourth over bowled by Vivian Kingma and Bangladesh were on their way.\n\nStruggling for form prior to this game, Shakib collected four boundaries in the sixth over, which yielded 19 runs, as Bangladesh reached 54 for two at the end of powerplay.\n\nMeanwhile, Tanzid tried to hit van Meekeren against the wind and paid the price, holing out to Bas de Leede in the outfield.\n\nBangladesh's two most experienced players, Mahmudullah and Shakib then added 41 runs for the fourth wicket to prop up the team.\n\nHowever, as the innings entered its final stretch, Mahmudullah, having hit two sixes and two furs, was done in by the strong wind as Engelbrecht completed another good catch near the ropes.",

Jaker Ali came in and blazed away to 14 in just 7 balls.\n\nAlso Read | India's Divya Deshmukh Wins World Junior Girls' Chess Championship 2024, Beats Bulgaria's Beloslava Krasteva To Achieve Feat.\n\nWith Bangladesh starting their innings with two left-handers, Netherlands skipper Scott Edwards tossed the new ball to off-spinner Aryan Dutt in the second over, and the move paid instant dividends as they got the big wicket of Bangladesh skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto (1).\n\nThe Dutch would do well to thank the Bangladesh captain for his horrendous shot selection as he went for a needless reverse sweep to be out caught in the first slip.\n\nAlso Read | Afghanistan vs Papua New Guinea Free Live Streaming Online, ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024: How To Watch AFG vs PNG Cricket Match Live Telecast on TV?.\n\nDutt also accounted for Litton Das at the beginning of fourth over thanks to a stunning catch in the deep by a sprinting Sybrand Engelbrecht. After Das swept Dutt towards square leg, Engelbrecht covered a lot of ground and dived full-length to pull off the catch.\n\nThe shot Das played was also unnecessary given that Tanzid Hasan had picked up two boundaries and a six in the previous over. For the maximum, Tanzid danced down the ground and flayed it over covers.\n\nThe only change in the Dutch line-up for this vital Group D match, Dutt vindicated the team management's decision by returning excellent figures of 2/17 in his full quota of four overs. Paul van Meekeren (2/15) was also brilliant with the ball.\n\nAs many as 18 came off the fourth over bowled by Vivian Kingma and Bangladesh were on their way.\n\nStruggling for form prior to this game, Shakib collected four boundaries in the sixth over, which yielded 19 runs, as Bangladesh reached 54 for two at the end of powerplay.\n\nMeanwhile, Tanzid tried to hit van Meekeren against the wind and paid the price, holing out to Bas de Leede in the outfield.\n\nBangladesh's two most experienced players, Mahmudullah and Shakib then added 41 runs for the fourth wicket to prop up the team.\n\nHowever, as the innings entered its final stretch, Mahmudullah, having hit two sixes and two furs, was done in by the strong wind as Engelbrecht completed another good catch near the ropes.",

Shanto went for the reverse sweep first up and hit the ball straight to first slip.\n\nLitton Das then joined Tanzid Hasan in the middle. Tanzid, a naturally aggressive player, took the attack back to pacer Vivian Kingma.\n\nLitton went for the sweep early in his innings off Dutt, trying to take advantage of the positive match-up, but Sybrand Engelbrecht took an absolute screamer to dismiss the Bangladesh number three.\n\nTanzid and Shakib, despite losing the openers, played their natural game. The Netherlands tried to attack them by short-pitched bowling but the duo was equal to the task.\n\nShakib, in particular, got going with a 19-run over off pacer Logan van Beek. He played cut and pull shots in that over against short balls, his nemesis lately.\n\nTanzid, on the other hand, was the first to counterattack. After his captain Shanto's dismissal, the southpaw took down Vivian Kingma and played the opponent's best bowler Dutt fairly well.

enjoying the first international match in St Vincent in almost a decade.\n\nTaking to the field, the veteran all-rounder conceded consecutive sixes to Singh in his second over, but returned tidy figures of 0-29 from his four overs.\n\nHowever it was 21-year-old spinner Rishad who was the star of the Bangladesh bowling display, removing Englebrecht and De Leede to snuff out Dutch hopes of

He hit five fours and a six in his vital knock.\n\nBut the short ball worked in the end for the Netherlands and Paul van Meekeren as Tanzid (35 off 26) pulled the ball, but not with conviction, and lost his wicket.\n\nThe left-handed duo added 48 off just 32 balls.\n\nTowhid Hridoy was tied down by the Netherlands spinners and in the end he was cleaned up by Tim Pringle as he shaped for a cut shot in a delivery too close to cut. Hridoy's dismissal left Bangladesh in a spot of bother at 89-4 in the 13th over.\n\nBangladesh struggled to hit the older ball and the scoring rate was under a run-a-ball in the middle phase (7-15) and they needed some big overs to go past the 150-run mark.\n\nMahmudullah (25 off 21) and Jaker Ali struck a few lusty blows before Shakib's array of cheeky shots in the final over to take Bangladesh to 159-5.", "source": {"uri": "tbsnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Business Standard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakib_Al_Hasan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shakib Al Hasan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryan_Dutt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aryan Dutt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najmul_Hossain_Shanto", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Najmul Hossain Shanto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnos_Vale_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arnos Vale Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouncer_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bouncer (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Off spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingstown", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kingstown"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kingstown"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_van_Beek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logan van Beek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_van_Meekeren", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul van Meekeren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmudullah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mahmudullah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivian_Kingma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vivian Kingma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towhid_Hridoy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Towhid Hridoy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed_Products", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed Products", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2024/06/13/img_20240613_220058.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648225", "eventUri": "eng-9648225", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Tanzid Hasan set the tone with a brisk 35 off 26 balls, while Shakib Al Hasan played a crucial role with an unbeaten 64 off 46 deliveries, featuring nine boundaries. Contributions from Mahmudullah (25 off 21) and Jaker Ali (14* off 7) bolstered their innings. The Netherlands bowlers found some success with Paul van Meekeren and Aryan Dutt both picking up two wickets.\n\nChasing 160 runs, the Netherlands got off to a shaky start losing early wickets. Sybrand Engelbrecht provided resistance with a quickfire 33 off 22 balls, supported by Vikramjit Singh's 26 off 16 balls. However, Bangladesh's disciplined bowling attack, led by Rishad Hossain (3/33) and Taskin Ahmed (2/30), kept the pressure on. Despite late efforts from the lower order, the Netherlands could only manage 134/8 in their 20 overs, falling short of the target.\n\nShakib Al Hasan's unbeaten innings and Rishad Hossain's crucial wickets were pivotal in Bangladesh's victory, ensuring they maintained control throughout the match. With this win, Bangladesh strengthens their position in Group D, while the Netherlands will look to bounce back in their upcoming matches.\n\nAlso Read: Watch: Engelbrecht takes stunning catch to dismiss Das\n\nAfter the match, Shakib Al Hasan, Player of the Match, emphasized the importance of a top-order batter anchoring the innings on a challenging pitch.

In terms of bowling, Taksin Ahmed will be a key, particularly with the new ball.\n\nVivian Kingma was a relatively unknown name prior to the main event but his consistent display with the ball makes him the player to watch out for the Dutch. Logan van Beek, Bas de Leede, and Tim Pringle have the experience to play such high intensity games. Batting is a problem for the team with only Max O'Dowd managing a big score.

of their own if they defeat the Tigers and Sri Lanka.\n\nSo far four teams have booked their spots in the Super Eights South Africa, India, West Indies and Australia.\n\ndj/nr", "source": {"uri":

Courtesy of this win, the Bangla Tigers have placed their one foot in the next stage of the marquee event which is the Super Eight round.\n\nNotbaly, for the Asian side, the veteran allrounder Shakib Al Hasan got back to his form as he struck a vital unbeaten fifty (64* off 46) to pilot his side to a competitive 159/5 in 20 overs. Besides, opener Tanzid Hasan (35 off 27) too gave the team a decent recovery after Bangladesh two wickets in quick succession as Aryan Dutt foxed (2/17) the skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto and Litton Das.\n\nMeanwhile, for Netherlands, after Dutt, Paul van Meekeren (2/15), Tom Pringle and some other Dutch bowlers contributed collectively. However, the Dutch side after starting decently, failed to put up a big partnership during the run chase. For Bangladesh Mustafizur Rahman bowled an impressive run curbing spell to keep his side in the hunt. Leg spinner Rishad later on wreaked havoc by dismantling the middle order batting after Scott Edwards and Sybrand Engelbrecht tried to take the game deep. As a result, Netherlands failed to reach the target and handed Bangladesh a comfortable win.\n\nAlso Check: Most Wickets T20 World Cup 2024\n\nIt was important for someone from top-four to bat through the innings. Happy to contribute. It was a tough pitch at the start, we held our nerves. Was a challenging total, not a winning one, but bowlers chipped in perfectly. Rishad and Fizz took it away from Netherlands. Hardly any international game was played in the last 4-5 years here. So, we didn't know what a good score was and had to keep wickets till 14-15 overs and take it from there. 160 in a WC game is always tricky. Netherlands had their moments, 10 runs an over on this ground in the last 7-8 overs, wind going in one way, made it tough to defend. But credit to bowlers for pulling it off. Neck braces was for batting and it did help.\n\nWe lost in all three facets. Credit to Bangladesh, they were great and we weren't up to it. They kept wickets in hand. Would be tough to bowl to a windy boundary. Stand between him and Sybrand - We knew they had quality bowlers at the death and wanted to maximise the middle overs but fell quickly. Aryan has been sensational in the last couple years and used the conditions well. It's a bit out of our hands now.

Jaker Ali came in and blazed away to 14 in just 7 balls.\n\nWith Bangladesh starting their innings with two left-handers, Netherlands skipper Scott Edwards tossed the new ball to off-spinner Aryan Dutt in the second over, and the move paid instant dividends as they got the big wicket of Bangladesh skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto (1).\n\nThe Dutch would do well to thank the Bangladesh captain for his horrendous shot selection as he went for a needless reverse sweep to be out caught in the first slip.\n\nDutt also accounted for Litton Das at the beginning of fourth over thanks to a stunning catch in the deep by a sprinting Sybrand Engelbrecht. After Das swept Dutt towards square leg, Engelbrecht covered a lot of ground and dived full-length to pull off the catch.\n\nThe shot Das played was also unnecessary given that Tanzid Hasan had picked up two boundaries and a six in the previous over. For the maximum, Tanzid danced down the ground and flayed it over covers.\n\nThe only change in the Dutch line-up for this vital Group D match, Dutt vindicated the team management's decision by returning excellent figures of 2/17 in his full quota of four overs. Paul van Meekeren (2/15) was also brilliant with the ball.\n\nAs many as 18 came off the fourth over bowled by Vivian Kingma and Bangladesh were on their way.\n\nStruggling for form prior to this game, Shakib collected four boundaries in the sixth over, which yielded 19 runs, as Bangladesh reached 54 for two at the end of powerplay.\n\nMeanwhile, Tanzid tried to hit van Meekeren against the wind and paid the price, holing out to Bas de Leede in the outfield.\n\nBangladesh's two most experienced players, Mahmudullah and Shakib then added 41 runs for the fourth wicket to prop up the team.\n\nHowever, as the innings entered its final stretch, Mahmudullah, having hit two sixes and two furs, was done in by the strong wind as Engelbrecht completed another good catch near the ropes.

It faces Nepal on Monday.\n\nThe Netherlands also needs a win against Sri Lanka on the same day, but will also depend on Bangladesh's result for its chances of qualifying.\n\nGroup leader South Africa has already confirmed its top spot from the group with three straight wins.\n\nPut into bat, Bangladesh opener Tanzid Hassan led the way with 35 off 26 balls. It was pegged back by off-spinner Aryan Dutt picking two early wickets.\n\nShakib and Hassan then added 48 off 32 balls to steady the ship. Paul van Meekeren provided the breakthrough by removing Hassan, but Shakib carried the innings through with 50 off 38 balls. He hit nine fours.\n\nToward the end, he put on 41 off 32 balls with Mahmudullah who scored 25 runs. Jaker Ali's 14 off seven balls helped Bangladesh cross the 150-mark.\n\nThe Netherlands didn't have a stern response to Bangladesh's all-round attack. Its top-order batters all got starts but failed to convert into big scores.\n\nSybrand Engelbrecht top-scored with 33, while Vikramjit Singh (26) and Scott Edwards (25) made vital contributions.\n\nSpin took over in the middle overs and at the death, and the Netherlands were unable to break through.\n\nHossain was on a hat-trick at one stage, but missed -- he still picked three wickets in four deliveries across overs 15 and 17.\n\nDefending champion England faces Oman in a must-win game in Antigua.

Shakib Al Hasan played a pivotal role, contributing a gritty 64 runs off 46 balls to propel his side to a competitive total of 159/5.\n\nShakib's innings proved crucial as he anchored Bangladesh's batting effort with resilience and skill. His composed knock ensured that Bangladesh posted a challenging score on the board, providing a solid foundation for their bowlers to defend. In response, the Netherlands struggled to mount a successful chase against Bangladesh's bowling attack. Despite efforts from their batters, the Netherlands could only manage to score 134/8, falling short by 25 runs in the end. Rishad Hossain emerged as the standout performer for the Netherlands with his effective bowling, claiming three prized wickets.\n\nIn the match, batting first, Bangladesh faced early setbacks with quick wickets falling. Skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto departed early, followed by Litton Das, leaving Bangladesh struggling at 23/2. However, Tanzid Hasan steadied the innings with a brisk 35 off 26 deliveries, including 5 fours and 1 six. The middle order was anchored by Shakib's unbeaten 64 off 46 balls, a crucial innings that included 9 boundaries and propelled Bangladesh to a competitive total of 159/5 in their 20 overs. Towhid Hridoy and Mahmudullah also contributed valuable runs to bolster the score.\n\nThe Netherlands bowlers put in a disciplined effort to restrict Bangladesh's batting lineup. Aryan Dutt and Paul van Meekeren were standout performers, both claiming 2 wickets each while maintaining economical spells. Tim Pringle and Logan van Beek also chipped in with crucial breakthroughs, although Bangladesh managed to set a challenging target with their late-order flourish.\n\nChasing 160 for victory, the Netherlands faced early setbacks as they lost Michael Levitt and Max O'Dowd cheaply. Vikramjit Singh provided some momentum with a quickfire 26 off 16 balls, but the middle order struggled against Bangladesh's bowling attack. Sybrand Engelbrecht's 33 off 22 balls briefly revived their hopes, but regular wickets fell at crucial junctures. Dutt's unbeaten 15 off 12 balls was not enough to overhaul the target, as the Netherlands finished at 134/8 in their allotted 20 overs.\n\nBangladesh's bowlers showcased excellent discipline and control throughout the innings. Taskin Ahmed and Rishad were the chief destroyers, both picking up 2 wickets each with economical spells to apply pressure on the Netherlands' batters. Mustafizur Rahman also contributed effectively to restrict scoring opportunities and ultimately seal the victory.", "source": {"uri": "crickettimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketTimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakib_Al_Hasan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shakib Al Hasan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indian_cricket_team_in_Bangladesh_in_2020\u201321", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Indian cricket team in Bangladesh in 2020\u201321"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnos_Vale_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arnos Vale Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingstown", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kingstown"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kingstown"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishad_Hossain", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rishad Hossain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najmul_Hossain_Shanto", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Najmul Hossain Shanto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liton_Das", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liton Das"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmudullah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mahmudullah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towhid_Hridoy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Towhid Hridoy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Pringle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Pringle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryan_Dutt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aryan Dutt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikramjit_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vikramjit Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_van_Beek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logan van Beek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_van_Meekeren", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul van Meekeren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafizur_Rahman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mustafizur Rahman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taskin_Ahmed", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taskin Ahmed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_O'Dowd", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max O'Dowd"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Five-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Five-Pin", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin Bowling", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://crickettimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Shakib-Al-Hasan-Rishad-Hossain.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648225", "eventUri": "eng-9648225", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 169, "textEnd": 176}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Both teams have won one game and lost one hence this is a must-win clash for both.\n\nBangladesh started with a win against Sri Lanka in a thrilling contest and let the game against South Africa slip away from their grasp but both performances will give them confidence. The conditions in the tournament have been such that it suits their playing style. They have a competent pace attack when the pitch offers seam moment and willy spinners when the surfaces start to grip a bit.\n\nOn the other hand, In their opening game, the Netherlands beat Nepal comfortably and looked a class apart. Against South Africa, they looked like they were going to snatch two points but David Miller's composure saw the Proteas through in a hard-fought game. The Dutch's performances in the last few ICC events have been impressive a win against Bangladesh will further reinstate the upward curve they have been on.\n\nFollow Bangladesh vs Netherlands live score and updates\n\nLive Blog\n\nBangladesh vs Netherlands T20 World Cup 2024 Live Score Updates: Catch all the live updates between BAN vs NED from Arnos Vale Ground, Kingstown, St Vincent\n\nT20 World Cup: In another low-scoring game in New York, Bangladesh batsmen freeze with finish line in sight\n\nMahmudullah's facepalm summed up the mood. Needing six off the last two balls to post their first-ever win over South Africa in T20 Internationals, Mahmudullah couldn't have asked for a better delivery. With all his pacers bowled out, South Africa skipper Aiden Markram had no choice but to turn to left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj for the last over with 11 needed.\n\nOff the fifth, Maharaj's full-toss arrived, just the right line for Mahmuduallah -- outside off, coming down at a good height -- to deposit anywhere he wanted.

England had won the toss and elected to bowl.\n\nEngland was without a win after two matches. It took a point from its rained-out first match against Scotland and lost by 36 runs to arch-rival Australia.\n\n\"We had a point to prove,\" Wood said between innings Thursday. \"We showed character and resilience.\"\n\nEarlier, Bangladesh edged closer to confirming its second-round qualification by beating the Netherlands by 25 runs.\n\nWrist spinner Rishad Hossain spun the Tigers to victory picking 3-33 in four overs, after star all-rounder Shakib al Hasan had scored 64 not out off 46 balls.\n\nBangladesh had put up 159-5 after it was put into bat, while the Netherlands was restricted to 134-8 in response in their Group D game.\n\nWith one game remaining, Bangladesh needs just two points to qualify for the \"super eight\" stage. It faces Nepal on Monday.\n\nThe Netherlands also needs a win against Sri Lanka on the same day, but will also depend on Bangladesh's result for its chances of qualifying.\n\nGroup leader South Africa has already confirmed its top spot from the group with three straight wins.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nPut into bat, Bangladesh opener Tanzid Hassan led the way with 35 off 26 balls. It was pegged back by off-spinner Aryan Dutt picking two early wickets.\n\nShakib and Hassan then added 48 off 32 balls to steady the ship. Paul van Meekeren provided the breakthrough by removing Hassan, but Shakib carried the innings through with 50 off 38 balls. He hit nine fours.\n\nToward the end, he put on 41 off 32 balls with Mahmudullah who scored 25 runs. Jaker Ali's 14 off seven balls helped Bangladesh cross the 150-mark.\n\nThe Netherlands didn't have a stern response to Bangladesh's all-round attack. Its top-order batters all got starts but failed to convert into big scores.\n\nSybrand Engelbrecht top-scored with 33, while Vikramjit Singh (26) and Scott Edwards (25) made vital contributions.\n\nSpin took over in the middle overs and at the death, and the Netherlands were unable to break through.\n\nHossain was on a hat-trick at one stage, but missed -- he still picked three wickets in four deliveries across overs 15 and 17.\n\nAfghanistan plays Papua New Guinea in Trinidad.\n\nAP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType":

Watch: Tanzid Hasan avoids serious injury as balls gets stuck in his helmet visor", "body": "Tanzid Hasan, on Thursday (June 13), avoided a nasty face injury during the ongoing game between Bangladesh and Netherlands at the Arnos Vale Ground, Kingstown, St Vincent.\n\nThe incident took place in the third over when the Bangladesh batter was facing Vivian Kingma. The left-handed batsman started the over on a good note by hitting Kingma for a four and a six in the first three balls. It was followed by a double before he nearly copped a blow on his face.\n\nOn the fifth ball of the over, Kingma bowled a short delivery and Tanzid Hasan had absolutely no room to play the pull shot. The ball rose sharply and Tanzid Hasan was absolutely beaten by it as he was a bit late on the pull. He ended up top-edging the ball into the visor.\n\nFortunately for the Bangladesh batter, the ball got stuck in the visor and he did not suffer any serious injury. He had to undergo the mandatory concussion test and was cleared to continue batting.\n\nTalking about the game, Bangladesh were on 71 for 3 in the ninth over at the time of writing this report. Towhid Hridoy and Shakib Al Hasan were batting in the middle for the Bangla Tigers.

Shakib Al Hasan, the veteran all-rounder put his hand up for Bangladesh as he and Jaker Ali in the end got their side to a score that could be defended looking at the trend of the matches in the ongoing ICC Men's T20 World Cup. However, the moment of the first innings belonged to Sybrand Engelbrecht.\n\nFormer South Africa U19 cricketer, who played the junior World Cup in 2008, anticipated the catch rather well. Litton Das slog swept an Aryan Dutt delivery, however, he didn't get much distance on it on the first delivery of the foourth over of the innings. Engelbrecht ran from the deep square leg to his left for around 25 metres, timed his jump to perfection and held on to a stunning full-length diving catch to see the back of Das.\n\nThe Dutch players were all around Engelbrecht as they knew it was an important wicket and it was as good as catches can get. Watch the video here:\n\nAfter losing a couple of wickets in the powerplay, Shakib and Tazid Hasan stitched a crucial 48-run stand to take Bangladesh's innings forward. Shakib after a few low scores, looked really good as Bangladesh might have felt a bit at home with the ball turning and staying a bit low on the surface.\n\nThe hero in the first two games for Bangladesh, Towhid Hridoy didn't have a great outing but Shakib continued on and smashed an unbeaten 64.

The matches have been characterized by intense battles between bat and ball, with bowlers seemingly holding the upper hand and restricting the flow of runs. The excitement of the T20 World Cup 2024 now shifts to Kingston, St. Vincent, where the highly competitive Group D promises another enthralling encounter between the Dutch and Bangladesh. Talking about the Netherlands first, they made an impressive start to their World Cup campaign by securing a win against Nepal in their opening fixture. Moreover, they demonstrated their potential to cause another upset when they posed a dangerous threat to the mighty South African side, despite defending a modest total of just 103 runs but it just wasn't their day. Netherlands' batting unit has given a lukewarm return so far, and to be fair to the batters, it just hasn't been a batting friendly affair. However, the likes of Max O'Dowd and Sybrand Engelbrecht have done the heavy lifting with the bat, the others need to get their game up and adapt to the situations. The Dutch bowling unit has been highly impressive, nearly pulling off an incredible heist against the mighty South African batting lineup. Vivian Kingma, Tim Pringle, and Logan van Beek, who has been their highest wicket-taker so far, have all been among the wickets, leading the charge. However, a well-rounded performance, with both batting and bowling clicking in unison, could make the Netherlands a tough nut to crack for any team in this tournament. Shifting our focus to the wounded lions from the subcontinent, Bangladesh, we find a team that has consistently shown its preparedness and ability to pose significant challenges, only to falter mid-way through campaigns. Their recent humbling defeat at the hands of the South African side has placed them in a precarious situation, and another loss from here could potentially derail their campaign altogether. Towhid Hridoy has been carrying the batting on his shoulders, but the experienced guys like Litton Das and Mahmudullah have also chipped in at times. However, they just couldn't get it going in the previous game, failing to chase down a measly 114 which is gotta sting them. Tanzid Hasan and skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto will be itching to contribute more consistently with the willow. On the bowling front, they've been decent, with Taskin Ahmed and Tanzim Hasan Sakib leading the pace attack. Rishad Hossain has surprisingly outshone the veteran Shakib Al Hasan, who's due for a big performance. The bowling hasn't been too much of a concern, but they'll surely need the batters to step up big time if they want to bounce back strongly. Also, a new venue of Arnos Vale , St. Vincent, adds an extra layer of intrigue to the clash.

The initial breakthrough came with the dismissal of Bangladesh skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto. Dutt continued his impressive spell by removing Litton Das, but the credit for this crucial wicket goes largely to Engelbrecht's outstanding catch.\n\nIn the first ball of the 4th over, Dutt bowled an in-drifter on a fullish length outside off stump. Litton attempted a slog sweep, causing the ball to soar high in the air. It seemed destined to land safely as no fielder appeared nearby. However, Engelbrecht had different plans. He sprinted swiftly to his left from deep square leg and, with outstretched hands, executed a breathtaking dive to complete a remarkable catch. This catch is already being hailed as potentially the best of the tournament. Litton had to walk back to the pavilion with a meager score of one run in two deliveries.\n\nIn all three games that Bangladesh has played in this edition, Litton has consistently fallen to spin bowling. Despite the early setbacks, Bangladesh managed to post a respectable total of 54/2 at the end of the powerplay, thanks to the efforts of experienced campaigners Shakib Al Hasan and Tanzid Hasan who steadied the innings.", "source": {"uri": "crickettimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketTimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybrand_Engelbrecht_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sybrand Engelbrecht (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indian_cricket_team_in_Bangladesh_in_2020\u201321", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Indian cricket team in Bangladesh in 2020\u201321"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liton_Das", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liton Das"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnos_Vale_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arnos Vale Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingstown", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kingstown"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kingstown"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najmul_Hossain_Shanto", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Najmul Hossain Shanto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakib_Al_Hasan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shakib Al Hasan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin Bowling", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://crickettimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Sybrand-Engelbrecht-takes-an-absolute-blinder-to-dismiss-Litton-Das.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648225", "eventUri": "eng-9648225", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 202, "textEnd": 209}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Dutch bowlers Paul van Meekeren and Aryan Dutt shined with impressive figures, but it was Shakib's blazing come-back and the experienced Mahmudullah's steadying presence that defined the innings.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakib_Al_Hasan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shakib Al Hasan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmudullah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mahmudullah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryan_Dutt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aryan Dutt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najmul_Hossain_Shanto", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Najmul Hossain Shanto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Edwards_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scott Edwards (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liton_Das", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liton Das"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Off spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_van_Meekeren", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul van Meekeren"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Competitions", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/15_05_2024_17_57_30_5260459.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648225", "eventUri": "eng-9648225", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

He sprinted swiftly to his left from deep square leg and, with outstretched hands, executed a breathtaking dive to complete a remarkable catch.

The incident occurred when Kingma bowled a sharp bouncer aimed at Tanzid's body in the third over of Bangladesh's innings. Tanzid attempted to pull the ball but mistimed his shot, resulting in a top edge that caused the ball to rebound directly into the grill of his helmet. To everyone's surprise, the ball got stuck in the visor and remained there.\n\nAs the ball remained stuck in the helmet, Tanzid quickly removed his headgear, and the medical team rushed onto the field to conduct a concussion test. There were immediate concerns for Tanzid's safety, considering the force with which bouncers are bowled. The medical assessment confirmed that Tanzid had not sustained any injury and was fit to continue. The opener's teammates and the crowd breathed a sigh of relief, applauding his resilience and calm demeanor amidst the extraordinary circumstances.\n\nBAN vs NED: Live Score\n\nNetherlands captain Scott Edwards won the toss and chose to field against Bangladesh in their Group D match of the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 at the Arnos Vale Ground on Thursday. With South Africa having already secured one Super Eight spot in Group D, Bangladesh and the Netherlands are vying for the remaining position. Both teams have one win and one loss, with the net run rate currently being the only differentiator.\n\nBangladesh started their campaign with a two-wicket victory over Sri Lanka but then lost to South Africa despite being in a strong position. The Netherlands defeated Nepal in their opener but also succumbed to South Africa. At the toss, Edwards remarked, \"We are going to bowl first. Not too many international games have been played here recently. Our boys are looking forward to it, and we've been playing some good cricket.

The game is being played at the Arnos Vale Ground in Kingstown, St Vincent. Both teams are aiming to secure a place in the Super Eight stage of the tournament. Both sides have previously lost to South Africa in this tournament. Due to rain, the toss took place 30 minutes later than usual. Edwards, upon winning the toss, opted to bowl first, likely considering the overcast conditions and the potential for early movement off the pitch.\n\nThe Netherlands made a single change to their side, bringing in off-spinner Aryan Dutt in place of all-rounder Teja Nidamanuru. Although Edwards did not reveal the exact reason for this change, it is speculated that the spin-friendly conditions observed in the West Indies throughout the tournament influenced this decision. Edwards mentioned that not many teams are familiar with the conditions in St Vincent, suggesting that his team is well-prepared and will give themselves every chance to succeed.\n\nReflecting on the decision to bowl first, Edwards explained \"We are gonna have a bowl first. Not too many international games have been played here recently. Our boys are looking forward to it, we have been playing some good cricket. Aryan Dutt is in for Teja,\"\n\nBangladesh have decided to field the same team that played against South Africa, remaining unchanged for this crucial match. Najmul Hossain Shanto, at the toss, expressed confidence in batting first, highlighting the good nature of the wicket but also cautioning about the challenges of facing the new ball. He emphasized the advantage of having a leg-spinner, Rishad Hossain, in their ranks.", "source": {"uri": "crickettimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketTimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Edwards_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scott Edwards (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnos_Vale_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arnos Vale Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingstown", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kingstown"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kingstown"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teja_Nidamanuru", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teja Nidamanuru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryan_Dutt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aryan Dutt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Off spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishad_Hossain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rishad Hossain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najmul_Hossain_Shanto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Najmul Hossain Shanto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leg spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Lawn_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Lawn Bowling", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin Bowling", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://crickettimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Teja-Nidamanuru.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648225", "eventUri": "eng-9648225", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 147, "textEnd": 154}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

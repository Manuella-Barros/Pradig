It's the sort of question that captivates academics and activists, roping in everyone from Israeli \"Wonder Woman\" actress Gal Gadot to African-American literary luminary James Baldwin.\n\nOn the one hand, Jews have been discriminated against for centuries, including by white cultures from Nazi Germany to the United States. On the other, many Jews have attained a significant measure of acceptance, and many can often \"pass\" as white when not wearing traditional Jewish symbols.\n\nImplicitly at stake in this argument is whether efforts to combat racism should prioritize prejudice against Jews or whether other persecuted populations should take precedence.\n\nPersonally, I've found this debate beside the point, and this weekend's disturbing events in Charlottesville perfectly illustrate why: The white supremacists have already made their decision.\n\nWhen white nationalists descended upon the historic Virginia city to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee, their \"Unite the Right\" rally gathered a veritable who's who of top neo-Nazis in the United States, including the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and alt-right leading light Richard Spencer, among others.\n\nThey immediately went after the Jews. At their Friday night rally at the University of Virginia, the white nationalists brandished torches and chanted anti-Semitic and Nazi slogans, including \"blood and soil\" (an English rendering of the Nazi \"blut und boden\") and \"Jews will not replace us\" -- all crafted to cast Jews as foreign interlopers who need to be expunged. The attendees proudly displayed giant swastikas and wore shirts emblazoned with quotes from Adolf Hitler. One banner read, \"Jews are Satan's children.\"\n\n\"The truth is,\" Duke told a large crowd Saturday, \"the American media, and the American political system, and the American Federal Reserve, is dominated by a tiny minority: the Jewish Zionist cause.\" Addressing another group, Richard Spencer mocked Charlottesville's Jewish mayor, Mike Signer. \"Little Mayor Signer - 'See-ner' - how do you pronounce this little creep's name?\" Spencer asked. The crowd responded by chanting, \"Jew, Jew, Jew.\" In TV interviews, attendees were not shy about their anti-Semitism.\n\nAnd James Fields Jr., the man who is accused of mowing down protesters that day, killing one and injuring 19, \"had this fascination with Nazism and a big idolatry of Adolf Hitler,\" according to his high school history teacher. He was previously photographed at a rally for Vanguard America, a neo-Nazi group dedicated to fighting \"the international Jew.\"\n\nNone of this should surprise us. The United States' white nationalists have made no secret of their special hate for Jews, particularly during the 2016 campaign and its aftermath.\n\nInspired by Donald Trump, Duke himself ran for Senate in Louisiana, spending much of his time on the primary debate stage ranting against the Jews. When Melania Trump was found to have plagiarized Michelle Obama in her Republican National Convention address, Duke declared he'd \"bet a gefilte fish\" that it was Jewish sabotage.\n\nThroughout the presidential campaign, Trump's alt-right supporters barraged Jewish journalists with online abuse, including CNN's Jake Tapper, the Atlantic's Julia Ioffe and me, photoshopping us into gas chambers and concentration camps.\n\nThis conduct is not incidental to the white nationalist program; it is essential.\n\nAs the Southern Poverty Law Center's Eric Ward, an African-American scholar and activist who has studied the movement for years, recently put it:\n\n\"The successes of the civil rights movement created a terrible problem for white supremacist ideology. White supremacism -- inscribed de jure by the Jim Crow regime and upheld de facto outside the South -- had been the law of the land, and a black-led social movement had toppled the political regime that supported it. How could a race of inferiors have unseated this power structure through organizing alone? . . . Some secret cabal, some mythological power, must be manipulating the social order behind the scenes. This diabolical evil must control television, banking, entertainment, education and even Washington D.C. It must be brainwashing white people, rendering them racially unconscious.\n\n\"What is this arch-nemesis of the white race, whose machinations have prevented the natural and inevitable imposition of white supremacy? It is, of course, the Jews. Jews function for today's white nationalists as they often have for anti-Semites through the centuries: as the demons stirring an otherwise changing and heterogeneous pot of lesser evils.\"\n\nFor this reason, Jews are the only \"white people\" obsessively targeted by white supremacists. So are they really white, not at all or something in between? After Charlottesville, it's clear we no longer have the luxury of debating the finer points of this question. For the time being, the racists have settled it for us.\n\nRacism, after all, is essentially the result of socially constructed categories imposed by bigots to separate out-groups from an in-group: white from nonwhites, Germans from Jews and so on.\n\nAs such, any serious anti-racist effort needs to confront the racists where they are. When white supremacists are viciously attacking Jews as nonwhite impostors, then any anti-racists worthy of the name must be there to defend them. They cannot impose their own definitions of whiteness on Jews and sidestep their plight. Otherwise, they are simply ceding Jews to their assailants and effectively abetting their persecution.\n\nJews understand this dynamic from hard experience. For this reason, Israel's law of return guaranteeing citizenship to any Jew uses the Nazi definition of \"one Jewish grandparent,\" even as there is a contentious debate within the Jewish community over who exactly is a Jew. When it comes to countering prejudice, however, those concerns are set aside. Given the current moment, we must do the same in the United States.\n\nThe question of whether Jews are white is a valuable and engaging one, especially to writers like me. But to debate the intersection of Jewish identity and whiteness tomorrow, we need to protect that Jewish identity today.\n\nOnce the white supremacists are consigned to the ash heap of history, we can return to contesting claims of Jewishness and whiteness. Until then, however, the question is at best a distraction from fighting racism and at worst a path to perpetuating it.", "date": "2017-08-14", "categories": [{"uri":

(Evelyn Hockstein for The Washington Post)\n\nJews and non-Jews are drawn to debates about whether Jews are white. It's the sort of question that captivates academics and activists, roping in everyone from Israeli \"Wonder Woman\" actress Gal Gadot to African American literary luminary James Baldwin.\n\nOn the one hand, Jews have been discriminated against for centuries, including by white cultures from Nazi Germany to the United States. On the other, Jews have attained a significant measure of acceptance, and many can often \"pass\" as white when not wearing traditional Jewish symbols.\n\nImplicitly at stake in this argument is whether efforts to combat racism should prioritize prejudice against Jews or whether other persecuted populations should take precedence.\n\nPersonally, I've found this debate beside the point, and this weekend's disturbing events in Charlottesville perfectly illustrate why: The white supremacists have already made their decision.\n\nWhen white nationalists descended upon the historic Virginia city to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee, their \"Unite the Right\" rally gathered a veritable who's who of top neo-Nazis in the United States, including Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke and alt-right leading light Richard Spencer, among others.\n\nThey immediately went after the Jews. At their Friday night rally at the University of Virginia, the white nationalists brandished torches and chanted anti-Semitic and Nazi slogans, including \"blood and soil\" (an English rendering of the Nazi \"blut und boden\") and \"Jews will not replace us\" -- all crafted to cast Jews as foreign interlopers who need to be expunged. The attendees proudly displayed giant swastikas and wore shirts emblazoned with quotes from Adolf Hitler. One banner read, \"Jews are Satan's children.\"\n\n\"The truth is,\" Duke told a large crowd Saturday, \"the American media, and the American political system, and the American Federal Reserve, is dominated by a tiny minority: the Jewish Zionist cause.\" Addressing another group, Richard Spencer mocked Charlottesville's Jewish mayor, Mike Signer. \"Little Mayor Signer -- 'See-ner' -- how do you pronounce this little creep's name?\" Spencer asked. The crowd responded by chanting, \"Jew, Jew, Jew.\"\n\nIn TV interviews, attendees were not shy about their anti-Semitism:\n\nAnd James Fields Jr., the man who is accused of mowing down protesters that day, killing one and injuring 19, \"had this fascination with Nazism and a big idolatry of Adolf Hitler,\" according to his high school history teacher. He was previously photographed at a rally for Vanguard America, a neo-Nazi group dedicated to fighting \"the international Jew.\"\n\nNone of this should surprise us. The United States' white nationalists have made no secret of their special hate for Jews, particularly during the 2016 campaign and its aftermath. Inspired by Donald Trump, Duke himself ran for Senate in Louisiana, spending much of his time on the primary debate stage ranting against the Jews. When Melania Trump was found to have plagiarized Michelle Obama in her Republican National Convention address, Duke declared he'd \"bet a gefilte fish\" that it was Jewish sabotage.\n\nThroughout the presidential campaign, Trump's alt-right supporters barraged Jewish journalists with online abuse, including CNN's Jake Tapper, the Atlantic's Julia Ioffe and me, photoshopping us into gas chambers and concentration camps.\n\nThis conduct is not incidental to the white nationalist program; it is essential.\n\nAs the Southern Poverty Law Center's Eric Ward, an African American scholar and activist who has studied the movement for years, recently put it:\n\n\"The successes of the civil rights movement created a terrible problem for white supremacist ideology. White supremacism -- inscribed de jure by the Jim Crow regime and upheld de facto outside the South -- had been the law of the land, and a black-led social movement had toppled the political regime that supported it. How could a race of inferiors have unseated this power structure through organizing alone? ... Some secret cabal, some mythological power, must be manipulating the social order behind the scenes. This diabolical evil must control television, banking, entertainment, education and even Washington D.C. It must be brainwashing white people, rendering them racially unconscious.\"\n\nWhat is this arch-nemesis of the white race, whose machinations have prevented the natural and inevitable imposition of white supremacy? It is, of course, the Jews. Jews function for today's white nationalists as they often have for anti-Semites through the centuries: as the demons stirring an otherwise changing and heterogeneous pot of lesser evils.\n\nFor this reason, Jews are the only \"white people\" obsessively targeted by white supremacists. So are they really white, not at all or something in between? After Charlottesville, it's clear we no longer have the luxury of debating the finer points of this question. For the time being, the racists have settled it for us.\n\nRacism, after all, is essentially the result of socially constructed categories imposed by bigots to separate out-groups from an in-group: white from nonwhites, Germans from Jews and so on.\n\nAs such, any serious anti-racist effort needs to confront the racists where they are. When white supremacists are viciously attacking Jews as nonwhite impostors, then any anti-racists worthy of the name must be there to defend them. They cannot impose their own definitions of whiteness on Jews and sidestep their plight. Otherwise, they are simply ceding Jews to their assailants and effectively abetting their persecution.\n\nJews understand this dynamic from hard experience. For this reason, Israel's law of return guaranteeing citizenship to any Jew uses the Nazi definition of \"one Jewish grandparent,\" even as there is a contentious debate within the Jewish community over who exactly is a Jew. When it comes to countering prejudice, however, those concerns are set aside. Given the current moment, we must do the same in the United States.\n\nThe question of whether Jews are white is a valuable and engaging one, especially to writers like me. But to debate the intersection of Jewish identity and whiteness tomorrow, we need to protect that Jewish identity today.\n\nOnce the white supremacists are consigned to the ash heap of history, we can return to contesting claims of Jewishness and whiteness. Until then, however, the question is at best a distraction from fighting racism and at worst a path to perpetuating it.\n\nYair Rosenberg is a senior writer at Tablet Magazine, where he covers politics, religion and culture.

Their request for extra protection ahead of Saturday's events was denied, and the synagogue was forced to hire an armed security guard from a private company to protect people as they worshipped.\n\nAlan Zimmerman, president of Congregation Beth Israel in Charlottesville, described what followed that day as the assemblage of Nazis and white supremacists marched past their synagogue.\n\nFor half an hour, three men dressed in fatigues and armed with semi-automatic rifles stood across the street from the temple. Had they tried to enter, I don't know what I could have done to stop them, but I couldn't take my eyes off them, either. Perhaps the presence of our armed guard deterred them. Perhaps their presence was just a coincidence, and I'm paranoid. I don't know.\n\nSeveral times, parades of Nazis passed our building, shouting, \"There's the synagogue!\" followed by chants of \"Seig Heil\" and other anti-Semitic language. Some carried flags with swastikas and other Nazi symbols.\n\nImagine it for a moment, will you? Just imagine standing outside of a peaceful synagogue (wherein 40 people were worshipping, according to Zimmerman), watching as Nazis march outside, not a stone's throw away. And really, make no mistake: these were Nazis marching in Charlottesville on Friday and Saturday. I shudder to think what might have happened had Zimmerman not been able to pay for an armed security guard.\n\nThere was apparently a close call, though, as Zimmerman describes a particularly worrying incident. He wrote:\n\nA guy in a white polo shirt walked by the synagogue a few times, arousing suspicion. Was he casing the building, or trying to build up courage to commit a crime? We didn't know. Later, I noticed that the man accused in the automobile terror attack wore the same polo shirt as the man who kept walking by our synagogue; apparently it's the uniform of a white supremacist group. Even now, that gives me a chill.\n\nThe automobile terror attack Zimmerman references here is the attack in which James Alex Fields Jr., plowed his car through a crowd of counter-protesters gathered to demonstrate against the Nazi groups assembled in Charlottesville. There's no telling whether this person outside the synagogue would have also tried to do something equally heinous, but really, that's kind of the most horrifying part of this all, isn't it?\n\nIt seemed likely, though, as Zimmerman found out later:\n\nSoon, we learned that Nazi websites had posted a call to burn our synagogue. I sat with one of our rabbis and wondered whether we should go back to the temple to protect the building. What could I do if I were there? Fortunately, it was just talk - but we had already deemed such an attack within the realm of possibilities, taking the precautionary step of removing our Torahs, including a Holocaust scroll, from the premises.\n\nIt's a scene that could have been pulled right out of a history book, really. But the tragic, scary thing about it all is that it isn't history -- it's the here and now. It's the world we live in right here, and the threat is literally standing right outside your door. I don't mean to sound like seriously every other writer covering Charlottesville right now -- I don't want to scare you into some kind of action, though let's be honest, any action in defense of innocent, marginalized people is welcome right now.\n\nRather, what stuck out to me was one important point that I think lies at the heart of this (still awful, still terrible) near-miss: it took assistance from local friends and allies to buff the protection available to the synagogue. In the end, it wasn't the police who could help -- admittedly, they had their hands full -- it was the synagogue's neighbors. Zimmerman wrote:\n\nJohn Aguilar, a 30-year Navy veteran, took it upon himself to stand watch over the synagogue through services Friday evening and Saturday, along with our armed guard. He just felt he should.\n\nWe experienced wonderful turnout for services both Friday night and Saturday morning to observe Shabbat, including several non-Jews who said they came to show solidarity (though a number of congregants, particularly elderly ones, told me they were afraid to come to synagogue).\n\nA frail, elderly woman approached me Saturday morning as I stood on the steps in front of our sanctuary, crying, to tell me that while she was Roman Catholic, she wanted to stay and watch over the synagogue with us. At one point, she asked, \"Why do they hate you?\" I had no answer to the question we've been asking ourselves for thousands of years.\n\nAt least a dozen complete strangers stopped by as we stood in front the synagogue Saturday to ask if we wanted them to stand with us.\n\nIt's just straight up heartening to see so many people, Jewish or not, step up to just do the right thing and help protect innocent lives. Where the police fell short (for whatever reason), everyday private citizens pick up the slack to stand up against hate. While white supremacists and Nazis gather and speak about making their presence \"finally known,\" it becomes even more important for us to show that we who stand against hatred were already here, we're still here, and we will always be here.\n\nI wonder, sometimes with abject dread, what new incident will end up inspiring more people to call for solidarity and unity in the face of hatred. I wonder whether we'll ever reach a point where we just don't have to call for it anymore.\n\nFriends.\n\nI've said this before, but I'll say it again.\n\nOur streets need to look like this.\n\nThat was South Korea last year. pic.twitter.com/pb0mpVG3bC\n\n-- Shaun King (@ShaunKing) August 15, 2017\n\nIt can indeed feel foolish, if not downright naive, to try to look for hope in such frightening times.

And it's in that death of momentum, it's in that complicit silence that Nazis find safety and comfort where there should be none for them whatsoever. God, it feels like such a clich\u00e9 to say now, but truly, hope is something worth protecting, it's something worth holding on to. But more than that, hope is something worth showing, it's something worth demonstrating with every fiber of your being. And whether your hope looks like standing with counter-protesters, donating to their cause, or straight up punching a Nazi, know this: it's a hope worth celebrating, worth appreciating, and worth demonstrating over and over and over again.\n\nEspecially that punching Nazis-type of hope.

A Navy veteran \"took it upon himself\" to stand watch over the synagogue during Shabbat services on Friday evening and Saturday morning, Zimmerman said, and at least \"a dozen\" complete strangers stopped by the synagogue to ask if they needed assistance.\n\nZimmerman also described how an elderly woman, who said she was Roman Catholic, approached him, crying and asked, \"Why do they hate you?\"\n\n\"I had no answer to the question we've been asking ourselves for thousands of years,\" Zimmerman said.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Hinduism", "wgt": 100, "id": 1180, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Hinduism"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100, "id": 1181, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}, "type": "loc", "id": "102"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "200134"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "242096"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "302588", "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302813", "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synagogue", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303449", "label": {"eng": "Synagogue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304554", "label": {"eng": "Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305969", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_prayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "307985", "label": {"eng": "Jewish prayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310713", "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "312441", "label": {"eng": "Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "318256", "label": {"eng": "Ku Klux Klan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "341009", "label": {"eng": "Torah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "357315", "label": {"eng": "Swastika"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_symbolism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "453631", "label": {"eng": "Nazi symbolism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_monuments_and_memorials_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1282363", "label": {"eng": "List of monuments and memorials of the Confederate States of America"}}]}

Later, I noticed that the man accused in the automobile terror attack wore the same polo shirt as the man who kept walking by our synagogue; apparently it's the uniform of a white supremacist group. Even now, that gives me a chill.\n\n\"When services ended, my heart broke as I advised congregants that it would be safer to leave the temple through the back entrance rather than through the front, and to please go in groups.\n\n\"Soon, we learned that Nazi websites had posted a call to burn our synagogue. I sat with one of our rabbis and wondered whether we should go back to the temple to protect the building. What could I do if I were there? Fortunately, it was just talk - but we had already deemed such an attack within the realm of possibilities, taking the precautionary step of removing our Torahs, including a Holocaust scroll, from the premises.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we felt we had no choice but to cancel a Havdalah service at a congregant's home. It had been announced on a public Facebook page, and we were fearful that Nazi elements might be aware of the event. Again, we sought police protection - not a battalion of police, just a single officer - but we were told simply to cancel the event.\n\n\"Local police faced an unprecedented problem that day, but make no mistake, Jews are a specific target of these groups, and despite nods of understanding from officials about our concerns - and despite the fact that the mayor himself is Jewish - we were left to our own devices. The fact that a calamity did not befall the Jewish community of Charlottesville on Saturday was not thanks to our politicians, our police, or even our own efforts, but to the grace of God.\"\n\nZimmerman writes, \"We will get back to normal, also. We have two b'nai mitzvah coming up, and soon, Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur will be upon us, too.\"\n\nHe relates: \"A frail, elderly woman approached me Saturday morning as I stood on the steps in front of our sanctuary, crying, to tell me that while she was Roman Catholic, she wanted to stay and watch over the synagogue with us. At one point, she asked, 'Why do they hate you?' I had no answer to the question we've been asking ourselves for thousands of years.\"\n\nTags:violence, Charlottesville\n\nRelated StoriesObama is King of TwitterTrump: Both sides to blame for Virginia violenceStop lying: There was plenty of leftist violence in CharlottesvilleCharlottesville Jewish community hires securityCharlottesville attacker was Nazi sympathizer, says ex-teacherWatch: Raw footage of car ramming attack in Virginia'Crazy and unfortunate display of violence'Suspect arrested in Charlottesville car ramming", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "wgt": 100, "id": 203, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100, "id": 1181, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}, "type": "loc", "id": "102"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "200134"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "302507", "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302532", "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302813", "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "302866", "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "302966", "label": {"eng": "Violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synagogue", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303449", "label": {"eng": "Synagogue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304554", "label": {"eng": "Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305262", "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305563", "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305969", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306352", "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_prayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307985", "label": {"eng": "Jewish prayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo_shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "310046", "label": {"eng": "Polo shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310713", "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "312441", "label": {"eng": "Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_and_Bat_Mitzvah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "313714", "label": {"eng": "Bar and Bat Mitzvah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314551", "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "314998", "label": {"eng": "Rabbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "331469", "label": {"eng": "Sanctuary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "341009", "label": {"eng": "Torah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "357315", "label": {"eng": "Swastika"}}]}

Weimer says that Fields wrote a detailed research paper about the Nazi military in a class called \"America's Modern Wars\" at Randall K. Cooper High School in Kentucky. The teacher said, \"It was obvious that he had this fascination with Nazism and a big idolatry of Adolf Hitler. He had white supremacist views. He really believed in that stuff.\"\n\nJews and non-Jews are drawn to debates about whether Jews are white. It's the sort of question that captivates academics and activists, roping in everyone from Israeli \"Wonder Woman\" actress Gal Gadot to African-American literary luminary James Baldwin.\n\nOn the one hand, Jews have been discriminated against for centuries, including by white cultures from Nazi Germany to the United States. On the other, many Jews have attained a significant measure of acceptance, and many can often \"pass\" as white when not wearing traditional Jewish symbols.\n\nImplicitly at stake in this argument is whether efforts to combat racism should prioritize prejudice against Jews or whether other persecuted populations should take precedence.\n\nPersonally, I've found this debate beside the point, and this weekend's disturbing events in Charlottesville perfectly illustrate why: The white supremacists have already made their decision.\n\nWhen white nationalists descended upon the historic Virginia city to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee, their \"Unite the Right\" rally gathered a veritable who's who of top neo-Nazis in the United States, including the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and alt-right leading light Richard Spencer, among others.\n\nThey immediately went after the Jews. At their Friday night rally at the University of Virginia, the white nationalists brandished torches and chanted anti-Semitic and Nazi slogans, including \"blood and soil\" (an English rendering of the Nazi \"blut und boden\") and \"Jews will not replace us\" - all crafted to cast Jews as foreign interlopers who need to be expunged. The attendees proudly displayed giant swastikas and wore shirts emblazoned with quotes from Adolf Hitler. One banner read, \"Jews are Satan's children.\"\n\n\"The truth is,\" Duke told a large crowd Saturday, \"the American media, and the American political system, and the American Federal Reserve, is dominated by a tiny minority: the Jewish Zionist cause.\" Addressing another group, Richard Spencer mocked Charlottesville's Jewish mayor, Mike Signer. \"Little Mayor Signer - 'See-ner' - how do you pronounce this little creep's name?\" Spencer asked. The crowd responded by chanting, \"Jew, Jew, Jew.\" In TV interviews, attendees were not shy about their anti-Semitism.\n\nAnd James Fields Jr., the man who is accused of mowing down protesters that day, killing one and injuring 19, \"had this fascination with Nazism and a big idolatry of Adolf Hitler,\" according to his high school history teacher. He was previously photographed at a rally for Vanguard America, a neo-Nazi group dedicated to fighting \"the international Jew.\"\n\nNone of this should surprise us. The United States' white nationalists have made no secret of their special hate for Jews, particularly during the 2016 campaign and its aftermath.\n\nInspired by Donald Trump, Duke himself ran for Senate in Louisiana, spending much of his time on the primary debate stage ranting against the Jews. When Melania Trump was found to have plagiarized Michelle Obama in her Republican National Convention address, Duke declared he'd \"bet a gefilte fish\" that it was Jewish sabotage.\n\nThroughout the presidential campaign, Trump's alt-right supporters barraged Jewish journalists with online abuse, including CNN's Jake Tapper, the Atlantic's Julia Ioffe and me, photoshopping us into gas chambers and concentration camps.\n\nThis conduct is not incidental to the white nationalist program; it is essential.\n\nAs the Southern Poverty Law Center's Eric Ward, an African-American scholar and activist who has studied the movement for years, recently put it:\n\n\"The successes of the civil rights movement created a terrible problem for white supremacist ideology. White supremacism - inscribed de jure by the Jim Crow regime and upheld de facto outside the South - had been the law of the land, and a black-led social movement had toppled the political regime that supported it. How could a race of inferiors have unseated this power structure through organizing alone? . . . Some secret cabal, some mythological power, must be manipulating the social order behind the scenes. This diabolical evil must control television, banking, entertainment, education and even Washington D.C. It must be brainwashing white people, rendering them racially unconscious.\n\n\"What is this arch-nemesis of the white race, whose machinations have prevented the natural and inevitable imposition of white supremacy? It is, of course, the Jews. Jews function for today's white nationalists as they often have for anti-Semites through the centuries: as the demons stirring an otherwise changing and heterogeneous pot of lesser evils.\"\n\nFor this reason, Jews are the only \"white people\" obsessively targeted by white supremacists. So are they really white, not at all or something in between? After Charlottesville, it's clear we no longer have the luxury of debating the finer points of this question. For the time being, the racists have settled it for us.\n\nRacism, after all, is essentially the result of socially constructed categories imposed by bigots to separate out-groups from an in-group: white from nonwhites, Germans from Jews and so on.\n\nAs such, any serious anti-racist effort needs to confront the racists where they are. When white supremacists are viciously attacking Jews as nonwhite impostors, then any anti-racists worthy of the name must be there to defend them. They cannot impose their own definitions of whiteness on Jews and sidestep their plight. Otherwise, they are simply ceding Jews to their assailants and effectively abetting their persecution.\n\nJews understand this dynamic from hard experience. For this reason, Israel's law of return guaranteeing citizenship to any Jew uses the Nazi definition of \"one Jewish grandparent,\" even as there is a contentious debate within the Jewish community over who exactly is a Jew. When it comes to countering prejudice, however, those concerns are set aside. Given the current moment, we must do the same in the United States.\n\nThe question of whether Jews are white is a valuable and engaging one, especially to writers like me. But to debate the intersection of Jewish identity and whiteness tomorrow, we need to protect that Jewish identity today.\n\nOnce the white supremacists are consigned to the ash heap of history, we can return to contesting claims of Jewishness and whiteness. Until then, however, the question is at best a distraction from fighting racism and at worst a path to perpetuating it.\n\nThis story was originally published on washingtonpost.com.\n\nRosenberg is a senior writer at Tablet Magazine, where he covers politics, religion and culture.

Evidence isn't required.\n\nGeorge Steiner, the distinguished literary critic and influential thinker, is well known in Canada since his 1974 CBC Massey Lectures \"Nostalgia for the Absolute.\" In an interview not long ago, reflecting on being a Jew, he suggested that \"there is a hatred of Jews wherever there are no longer any Jews; even where there have never been Jews.\"\n\nPoland is a case in point. Before the Holocaust there were some 3.5 million Jews in the country, about 10 per cent of the population. Three million were exterminated and most of the survivors moved elsewhere. Today, there are only a few thousand left. Yet, in a recent survey, 80 per cent of Poles said that they wouldn't like to live next to a Jew.\n\nThough there have been Jews in Canada for some two centuries, they're a very small minority in the country. Even allowing for the growth of the Jewish population here after the Second World War, Jews constitute less than 1 per cent of the 36 million people who live here. Yet some 13 per cent of reported hate-motivated crimes in 2015 -- the last year for which there are statistics -- had Jews as their target.\n\nMuslims come second. But though there are three times as many Muslims in Canada as there are Jews, the number of hate crimes against them was 1 per cent less than against Jews. Though there's always enmity of the \"other\" whoever s/he may be, the Jew is still being targeted much more than any other member of a minority.\n\nCanada is one of the most open and safe countries in the world, but seemingly not quite as safe for Jews as it is for others. Europe has witnessed many more and much more lethal incidents, even though in most European countries, as in Poland, the number of Jews who live there after the Holocaust is very small, even in comparison to Canada's 1 per cent.\n\nEvery age and every culture has its own excuses for persecuting Jews. Evidence isn't required. Thus when the Church dominated Europe, the Jews were declared Christ-killers, ignoring the fact that Jesus was a Jew. When nationalism was in fashion, the Jews were deemed to be subversive enemies of the people. When communism ruled the day, the Jews were \"rootless cosmopolitan\" stooges of capitalism. Nowadays, of course, Jews are often conveniently describes as the oppressors of hapless Palestinians.\n\nThe fact that today Muslims in Europe are almost as vulnerable as Jews doesn't stop Muslims from attacking Jews. Recent incidents in France are still fresh in our minds. Last June, days after the fire that killed some 80 residents in a low-income apartment complex in London, Muslims demonstrated in the streets of the British capital blaming \"the Zionists\" (read: the Jews) for the tragedy.\n\nThough often they themselves are victims of prejudice, hatred and discrimination from the indigenous population in Britain, it didn't inhibit the many hundred Muslim marchers to make the accusation. Victimhood of Islamophobia doesn't seem to prevent victimization under the banner of anti-Semitism.\n\nCanada has mercifully never been in the grip of an ideology that needed an enemy, but being different is enough to be vulnerable. Though Jews are by no means alone in this, they still seem to be targeted more often than others.\n\nOver the years I've written several times about the issue of anti-Semitism on this page as a reminder of the disease that refuses to be cured. As a Jew and subject to anti-Semitic taunts in Poland when I was a child, and in Sweden where I grew up, I know whereof I write. Dispassionate scholars may bring the evidence, but Jews are here to tell the tale.\n\nDow Marmur is rabbi emeritus at Toronto's Holy Blossom Temple.

Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of Heather Heyer and the two Virginia State Police officers, H. Jay Cullen and Berke Bates, who lost their lives on Saturday, and with the many people injured in the attack who are still recovering. The loss of life far outweighs any fear or concern felt by me or the Jewish community during the past several weeks as we braced for this Nazi rally - but the effects of both will linger.\n\nOn Saturday morning, I stood outside our synagogue with the armed security guard we hired after the police department refused to provide us with an officer during morning services. (Even the police department's limited promise of an observer near our building was not kept - and note, we did not ask for protection of our property, only our people as they worshipped).\n\nForty congregants were inside. Here's what I witnessed during that time.\n\nFor half-an-hour, three men dressed in fatigues and armed with semi-automatic rifles stood across the street from the temple. Had they tried to enter, I don't know what I could have done to stop them, but I couldn't take my eyes off them, either. Perhaps, the presence of our armed guard deterred them. Perhaps, their presence was just a coincidence, and I'm paranoid. I don't know.\n\nSeveral times, parades of Nazis passed our building, shouting, \"There's the synagogue!\" followed by chants of \"Sieg Heil\" and other anti-Semitic language. Some carried flags with swastikas and other Nazi symbols.\n\nA guy in a white polo shirt walked by the synagogue a few times, arousing suspicion. Was he casing the building, or trying to build up courage to commit a crime? We didn't know. Later, I noticed that the man accused in the automobile terror attack wore the same polo shirt as the man who kept walking by our synagogue. Apparently, it's the uniform of a white supremacist group. Even now, that gives me a chill.\n\nWhen services ended, my heart broke as I advised congregants that it would be safer to leave the temple through the back entrance, rather than through the front, and to please go in groups.\n\nThis is 2017 in the United States of America.\n\nLater that day, I arrived on the scene shortly after the car plowed into peaceful protesters. It was a horrific and bloody scene.\n\nSoon, we learned that Nazi websites had posted a call to burn our synagogue. I sat with one of our rabbis and wondered whether we should go back to the temple to protect the building. What could I do if I were there? Fortunately, it was just talk - but, we had already deemed such an attack within the realm of possibilities, taking the precautionary step of removing our Torahs, including a Holocaust scroll, from the premises. Again: This is in America in 2017.\n\nAt the end of the day, we felt we had no choice but to cancel a Havdalah service at a congregant's home. It had been announced on a public Facebook page, and we were fearful that Nazi elements might be aware of the event. Again, we sought police protection - not a battalion of police, just a single officer - but we were told simply to cancel the event.\n\nLocal police faced an unprecedented problem that day but, make no mistake, Jews are a specific target of these groups, and despite nods of understanding from officials about our concerns - and despite the fact that the mayor, himself, is Jewish - we were left to our own devices. The fact that a calamity did not befall the Jewish community of Charlottesville on Saturday was not thanks to our politicians, our police, or even our own efforts, but to the grace of G-d.\n\nAnd yet, in the midst of all that, other moments stand out for me, as well.\n\nJohn Aguilar, a 30-year Navy veteran, took it upon himself to stand watch over the synagogue through services Friday evening and Saturday, along with our armed guard. He just felt he should.\n\nWe experienced wonderful turnout for services both Friday night and Saturday morning to observe Shabbat, including several non-Jews who said they came to show solidarity (though a number of congregants, particularly elderly ones, told me they were afraid to come to synagogue).\n\nA frail, elderly woman approached me Saturday morning as I stood on the steps in front of our sanctuary. Crying, she told me that while she was Roman Catholic, she wanted to stay and watch over the synagogue with us. At one point, she asked, \"Why do they hate you?\" I had no answer to the question we've been asking ourselves for thousands of years.\n\nAt least a dozen complete strangers stopped by as we stood in front the synagogue Saturday to ask if we wanted them to stand with us.\n\nAnd our wonderful rabbis stood on the front lines with other Charlottesville clergy, opposing hate.\n\nMost attention now is, and for the foreseeable future will be, focused on the deaths and injuries that occurred, and that is as it should be. But, for most people, before the week is out, Saturday's events will degenerate into the all-to-familiar bickering that is part of the larger, ongoing political narrative. The media will move on - and all it will take is some new outrageous Trump tweet to change the subject.\n\nWe will get back to normal, also. We have two B'nai Mitzvahs coming up, and soon, Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur will be upon us, too.\n\nAfter the nation moves on, we will be left to pick up the pieces. Fortunately, this is a very strong and capable Jewish community, blessed to be led by incredible rabbis. We have committed lay leadership, and a congregation committed to Jewish values and our synagogue. In some ways, we will come out of it stronger - just as tempering metals make them tougher and harder.\n\nAlan Zimmerman is president of Congregation Beth Israel, Charlottesville, Va.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100, "id": 1181, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}, "type": "loc", "id": "102"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "200134"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302507", "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302532", "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "302546", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302813", "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "302866", "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synagogue", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303449", "label": {"eng": "Synagogue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303465", "label": {"eng": "Departments of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304554", "label": {"eng": "Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305969", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "307475", "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo_shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "310046", "label": {"eng": "Polo shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310713", "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "312441", "label": {"eng": "Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "314991", "label": {"eng": "Reform Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "314995", "label": {"eng": "Shabbat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314998", "label": {"eng": "Rabbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "341009", "label": {"eng": "Torah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "357315", "label": {"eng": "Swastika"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havdalah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "410724", "label": {"eng": "Havdalah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_symbolism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "453631", "label": {"eng": "Nazi symbolism"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_State_Police", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virginia State Police"}, "type": "loc", "id": "466733"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_salute#Sieg_Heil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "588367", "label": {"eng": "Sieg Heil"}}]}

This is Nazis versus Jews in America, and where is our protection?\"\n\nHerzfeld added that he had driven to Charlottesville on Tuesday with a group of other rabbis in order \"not to be silent, not to be mute, when there are Nazis with guns marching in front of synagogues.\" On the journey, he said, the rabbis had sung a song with chorus, \"Do not be silent, do not be mute, oh my friend, do cry out.\"\n\nHerzfeld's demand came as other US Jewish leaders across the spectrum expressed anger toward President Donald Trump over his insistence that anti-fascist protesters were as much to blame for Saturday's violence -- which claimed the life Heather Heyer, as well as two police officers whose helicopter crashed as they were monitoring the situation -- as the neo-Nazi groups, as well as his

And it's not about the title.\n\nIn the article, Gurvitz starts out with the Israeli jargon \"get out of my veins\", which he addresses at American Jews, sarcastically moderating it to \"American Jews, kindly get out of my veins\".\n\nWhat Gurvitz is saying here, if I should summarize, is as he writes towards the end:\n\n\"When you are trying to impact Israel's policy as a Jew, you are granting legitimacy to this [discrimination of non-Jews]. You are saying: I, who was not born in Israel, should have not just a voice in its affairs - but a much louder voice than its non-Jewish natives. What do they call that popular hasbara trip? I have a birthright. You don't.\"\n\nBut is this really what an American Jew is saying, necessarily so?\n\nDoes a Jew who tries to impact Israel's policy, even declaredly so, as a Jew, necessarily claim that they have a \"much louder voice\" than the non-Jewish natives? Gurvitz continues,\n\n\"At least, you can't claim a birthright here and still claim to be a liberal. If you do, you're playing Israel's game: you're claiming Jews are a nation, you are claiming Israel is the national homeland of the Jews, and that therefore your voice counts more than non-Jews who live here. It shouldn't.\"\n\nBut are all Jewish Americans criticizing Israel claiming a 'birthright'? Gurvitz's point concerning 'birthright' is in itself interesting, in that it goes to the heart of Zionism and its manifestation in Israel as a Jewish State. One of the first laws passed in Israel was the Law of Return (1950) allowing any Jew from anywhere to receive immediate citizenship in Israel. The notion of this law, embedded in its very name, is the mythological Zionist notion that Jews are actually 'returning', after millennia of 'exile'. This mythology relies on the perception of Jews as a 'nation' (rather than a mere religion). The 'birthright' notion is a euphemism subscribing to this myth. So Gurvitz is completely right to say that subscription to the 'birthright' notion is subscription to the Zionist notion of 'Jewish nation'. But this still doesn't prove that all Jewish Americans subscribe to it. And Gurvitz's address is a general one to all Jewish Americans. What Gurvitz is essentially saying is that they should relinquish Zionism root and branch. Relinquishing Zionism root and branch is something that I am completely for. But many American Jews hold anti-Zionist views. And I am not just speaking about the ultra-orthodox who do so from religious Talmudic background (whom Gurvitz also refers to in footnote at the end of his article). I am also speaking about progressive American Jews. Philip Weiss wrote here in April in his article 'The Jewish revolution':\n\n\"Stefanie Fox [deputy Director, Jewish Voice for Peace] said that JVP was undertaking a review of its position on Zionism, a signal that the organization will adopt a strongly anti-Zionist stance in the months to come.\"\n\nWeiss noted about these young people, that\n\n\"They are trying to find their own way, Jewishly; and this has so far meant an openness to anti-Zionists, if not a rejection of the idea of a Jewish state.\"\n\nFox said that Zionism is \"not about the protection of Jews but the protection of a violent state\".\n\nThat's quite a cutting statement.\n\nSo there is a movement in that direction. But regardless, Zionism is not Judaism - and that is exactly what this younger generation is already getting quite strongly. They are not relinquishing their Judaism - they are cutting it from Zionism.\n\nRobert Cohen, in his article here on Mondoweiss from three days ago titled \"If you can't say equal rights, I can't work with you\", writes:\n\n\"The greatest issue, the greatest challenge:\n\nIf you've read any of my writing over the last six years, you'll know that I come at all of this from a particular Jewish perspective. I come to this issue out of solidarity with the Palestinian people but I come to it firstly from a concern for the future of Jews and Judaism. I'm in no doubt that as Jews, our relationship with Israel and the Palestinians is the greatest issue, and the greatest challenge, facing us in the 21st century. Everything else either relates to that relationship, or it pales into insignificance against it.\"\n\nWe can discuss which angle one should or could enter the paradigm of Zionism and \"Jewish state\" through, but is it not valid to consider it as a paradigm that is deeply connected with Judaism today, even if one believes Zionism to be anathema to Judaism?\n\nDoes claiming to be a Jew, whilst not being Israeli, necessarily buy into the 'Jewish nation' orthodoxy of Zionism? Does criticizing Israel whilst noting one's Jewishness openly (as for example Jewish Voice for Peace supporting BDS), necessarily grant legitimacy to Israel's discrimination?\n\nI find the logic here somewhat disingenuous. It suggests a blanket definition of Jews all over the world, wherein they either put away their Jewish identity completely when they criticize Israel, or they are being hypocritical.\n\nIndeed, Gurvitz suggests that the only valid and applicable notion wherein Jews oppose Israeli policy, is by them completely dismissing the fact that they are Jews, and acting simply as 'liberals'. As Gurvitz writes in his final paragraphs:\n\n\"Does it mean I don't want to hear from you? Not at all. You are important to me as liberals. Liberalism everywhere is under attack. You might have noticed that Israel is walking hand in hand with Russia and the eastern European anti-liberal governments. We are facing an international ultra-national movement. We need to link hands against it if we are to survive. So, as liberals, you are my allies; but, as Jews, kindly get out my veins. By speaking as Jews, you are lending force to the illiberal forces here. Speak to us in the voice of humanity you earned by standing by the civil rights movement, by the martyrs of the Freedom Riders; but don't speak to as Jews. My country only sees you as Jews when it needs to exclude others. Don't legitimize it.\"\n\nGurvitz's argument seems to suggest this is really, essentially, an Israeli matter. When he says 'get out of my veins', he is posing himself as the 'Israeli', who is asking the 'non-Israelis', in this case particularly American Jews, to keep away from the discussion about Israeli oppression, unless they can completely put away their Jewishness.\n\nOn one level, there's a logic here, which is supposedly based upon the geographical aspect of Israel, as opposed to its Jewish 'character' as a state. Gurvitz seems to want to accentuate this - that it's an Israeli matter, not a Jewish matter really.\n\nBut Gurvitz surely knows that an Israeli nationality doesn't exist. And that he thus does not exist as an Israeli national, because Israeli nationality is not recognized by Israel. Bluntly put - Israelis don't exist in the national sense. What really exists in the national sense, what Israel really is in the national sense, is a Jewish State, and the only ones who actually enjoy national rights (rather than merely citizenship rights), are the Jews - all over the world, whether they or their ancestors have ever stepped foot there or not. This is a novel concept.\n\nHence, Israel is an exceptionally Jewish issue (whether one agrees with the notions of a Jewish nation, Jewish state, Zionism etc. or completely rejects them). It is not illogical that Jews all over the world, indeed, as Jews, rise up even in the name of Judaism, and oppose Israeli policy as well as its national construct (which its policies vis-\u00e0-vis non-Jews are unquestionably an integral resultant of).\n\nIt would, in my view, be sterile and rather illogical to address Israel as a state divorced from Judaism, when it claims so loudly and so unequivocally to be married in with Judaism. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu regularly exploits terror to promote the Jewish State, announcing to all Jews that \"Israel is your home\", as he did in the wake of the Paris attacks and Copenhagen attacks in 2015 (and he's not the only Israeli leader doing that, see for example centrist Yair Lapid). This is indirectly saying to Jews all over the world, that where they happen to be living is not their home, not nationally so - because Israel is their ultimate, and hence only, national home.\n\nJews have a right to resist this attempt to speak on their behalf, and to resist such insidious and cynical attempts (supposedly for their own good) to drive a wedge between them and the societies and nations of which they are an integrated part. It makes very much sense that they do this as Jews, and this does not automatically legitimise the 'Jewish nation' notion as Gurvitz warns. In the mentioned example of Netanyahu, they are precisely opposing the blanket 'Jewish nation' notion by protesting the 'Israel is your home' advocacy, as many of them did.\n\nPersonally, I consider my concern for Palestinians as one that is closer to the 'liberal' one which Gurvitz describes, and I do not come out from the same prime concern for the \"future of Jews and Judaism\", as Robert Cohen puts it. But this to me is not the most central issue - people can reach Rome from many directions. What is important for me is that opposition to Israeli policy and ideology, not be alienated if it has a valid logical basis, also when that basis is declaredly 'Jewish'. Otherwise, I feel we are getting way too far into people's heads, and between them and their God. I feel this could easily become a matter of 'getting into people's veins'. What I'm saying is, you can both be Jewish and liberal.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100, "id": 885, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100, "id": 1181, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}, "type": "loc", "id": "102"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "191"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303332", "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304554", "label": {"eng": "Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_(1954\u201368)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306473", "label": {"eng": "African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954\u201368)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309896", "label": {"eng": "Palestinian people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "314994", "label": {"eng": "Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "315665", "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "315670", "label": {"eng": "Israelis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "315899", "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "318684", "label": {"eng": "American Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "366880", "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "366884", "label": {"eng": "Jewish state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haredi_Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "368508", "label": {"eng": "Haredi Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Israeli_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "369321", "label": {"eng": "Criticism of the Israeli government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "374051", "label": {"eng": "Talmud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Return", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "397677", "label": {"eng": "Law of Return"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "397678", "label": {"eng": "Jewish identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yair_Lapid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "407184", "label": {"eng": "Yair Lapid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Voice_for_Peace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "504104", "label": {"eng": "Jewish Voice for Peace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondoweiss", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "651251", "label": {"eng": "Mondoweiss"}}]}

Why? It's not just Israel, although that's a big part of it. Nor is it just about Jared and Ivanka. Nor is it blindness to the anti-Semitism and racism rampant among Trump's hard core base.\n\nQuite the contrary. Trump's Jewish supporters are well aware of the alt-right, and in a perverse way, they thrive on it. The shocking mainstreaming of anti-Semitism reinforces their worldview, their political ideology, and their support of Israel's hard-right fringe.\n\nFirst, to be clear, the \"Unite the Right\" rally and Trump's typical and tepid first response to it, was a watershed moment in American anti-Semitism. While the racism of KKK-supporting, Confederate flag-waving white supremacists was justifiably at the forefront of media coverage, the branding and execution of the event was explicitly anti-Semitic.\n\n\"Join Azzmador and The Daily Stormer to end Jewish influence in America,\" proclaimed the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer's advertisement of the event, accompanied by a Nazi-like figure wielding a hammer, ready to smash a Jewish star.\n\nAt the Saturday evening march on the University of Virginia campus, tiki-torch-bearing white nationalists chanted \"Jew will not replace us\" interchangeably with \"You will not replace us\" -- both familiar white nationalist slogans.\n\nAnd, of course, Trump's initial statement, condemning violence on \"many sides\" and refusing to call out his white nationalist supporters, was the most astonishing presidential accommodation of racism and anti-Semitism since the Wilson administration.\n\nEverything about this loathsome affair should have crossed a line for American Jews: the messaging, the violence, the size, and most of all the two days it took Trump to condemn \"racism\" specifically -- although still not the alt-right itself. As one rabbinic friend of mine put it on Facebook, \"Egyptians throw Jewish babies in the Nile; Pharaoh condemns violence on many sides.\" As a rabbi myself, I have never felt so alienated from my own country as I did on Sunday and Monday.\n\nAnd yet, none of it did cross a line. There was not a peep of remorse from Trump's prominent Jewish supporters.\n\nBecause, in fact, there is no line. Like a proverbial frog in boiling water, it should be clear by now that almost no increase in anti-Semitsm or racism will separate these Jews from the man who encourages their most bitter enemies.\n\nTo be sure, the most obvious reasons for their resilient support -- Israel, Israel, and Israel -- are quite salient. Some, though by no means most, Jews are indeed \"Israel First\" voters, and all of them are hard-right-wing. To them, supporting Israel means not coaxing Israel to the negotiating table so that it can reach a sustainable two-state solution with Palestine, but subsidizing settlements, right-wing yellow journalism, and right-wing political campaigns, all the while chanting that Americans should not tell Israel what to do.\n\nIt's also true that Trump's personal non-anti-Semitism -- after all, he's got mishpacha -- lessens the impact of his support for anti-Semites. Since the president is not himself an anti-Semite, his winking and nodding at millions of anti-Semites is not to be taken seriously.\n\nBut I think these explanations miss the deeper reason for the Jewish right's blas\u00e9 attitude toward events like \"Unite the Right\": that, in a way, they like them.\n\nThe worldview of the Jewish right is that it's us versus them. The world hates the Jews, always has hated the Jews, and if you don't understand that, you're na\u00efve. (David Mamet once wrote an entire book making just that argument.)\n\nTogether with that worldview is a political ideology that is first and foremost about Jewish power, both in the United States and, more importantly, Israel. Since all the goyim are out to get us, we have to be as strong as we possibly can. Violence is all they understand -- whether \"they\" are neo-Nazis or Arabs or whomever -- and so the only non-suicidal approach is to get as tough as possible.\n\nThis has been the Israeli right's guiding ideology for a hundred years -- the movement known as \"revisionist Zionism.\" Benjamin Netanyahu's father, Benzion Netanyahu, wrote several influential books arguing that since \"the Arabs\" will never accept Israel, Israel must settle in for decades of long, grinding conflict with them, finally wearing them down. That is the Israeli right's alternative to a two-state solution: a century of occupation and occasional war.\n\nThe same basic worldview animates the alliance between the American Jewish right -- predominantly Orthodox -- and the Republican Party. Bad people are out there, so get tough on crime, prop up traditional values, and carry as big a stick as possible on foreign affairs. And, of course, don't trust Muslims.\n\nEach time an anti-Semitic incident happens, this worldview is justified a little bit more. Obama-style coexistence with non-Jews seems like a pipe dream. Trump-style walls and cops and tough talk seem realistic. And the fact that Trump himself only condemns white nationalists when he absolutely has to (whether David Duke in 2016 or Unite the Right in 2017) -- well, look, maybe it's better not to antagonize them. On balance, Trump is still good for the Jews, this worldview believes.\n\nAt present, the large majority of American Jews disagree -- most of us, quite strongly and viscerally. To us, a president failing to condemn bigotry (while never missing an opportunity to condemn media figures, celebrities, politicians, or anyone else who crosses the president's mind) is never \"good for the Jews.\" It's a betrayal of our deepest values, an emboldening of our worst enemies, and a terrifying shift in our relationship to our country.\n\nIt's also tragically stupid. Rejecting the two-state solution doesn't strengthen Israel; it undermines it, as we see every day. Propping up the \"traditional\" values of those who, merely a generation ago, kept us out of their golf clubs and preached against us from their pulpits, weakens the liberal, multicultural America that has enabled Jews to thrive here. And \"getting tough\" on those who find themselves marginalized today makes it that much more dangerous for all who have been, are, or will be marginalized.\n\nBut that's for now. Thanks to assimilation and intermarriage among liberal Jews, and higher birthrates among Orthodox ones, the American Jewish community is rapidly becoming more conservative. There are also multimillion-dollar operations to promote Jewish conservatism, like the Jewish Review of Books and the Tikvah Fund, which has set up para-academic institutions to combat the supposedly left-wing bias of academia. Even the Anti-Defamation League has sometimes succumbed to such impulses; in response to Charlottesville, its director implied an equivalence between fascist white supremacists and anti-fascist demonstrators.\n\nEach time a white supremacist chants \"Jew will not replace us,\" such nationalistic, ethnocentric Jews grow closer to replacing the liberal, tolerant ones who helped create American popular culture, advance the American dream, and, yes, promote civil rights for all. These are the Jews who back Trump and obstruct peace in the Middle East.

We knew that.\n\nThat Nazis, and their white supremacist bedfellows, are bad people? We knew that too.\n\nThat when such people have grievances they always find reasons to implicate the Jews in some twisted way? No news here.\n\nThat most of America neither identifies with nor supports these bigots, their views, and their actions? We hope that this is still true - there are many signs that it is.\n\nThere are many explanations for Jew-hatred, and a hefty number of them focus on its psychological roots. I deal with these in the fourth chapter of my latest book (in Hebrew), The Jews: 7 Frequently Asked Questions. Chapter four begins with a story from about a thousand years ago, and then goes on to remind the readers that due to the Nazi persecution, Sigmund Freud was forced to leave his home in Vienna and move to London, where he died a year later.\n\nIn Freud's book, \"Moses and Monotheism,\" this great Jewish revolutionary offers an interpretation of Jew-hatred, claiming that Christians have an oedipal relationship with Jews. Judaism is the father religion, and Christianity is the rebellious son. Since then, many non-Freudian explanations have also viewed the psyche and human consciousness as key to understanding the hatred of Jews. Many of them highlight how Judaism, or the Jews, have always played into the hands of people who have a hard time deciphering the meaning of a puzzling and erratic world, especially in times of crisis.\n\nAnti-Semitism becomes deadly \"when a culture, nation or faith suffers from a cognitive dissonance so profound that it becomes unbearable,\" wrote Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks in his article \"The Return of Anti-Semitism.\" He was referring to societies who cannot quite figure out the changing world around them.\n\nWhen you ask what happened in Charlottesville, why they \"go after Jews\" (as Yair Rosenberg puts it) or why the Jews were targeted in Virginia, there is your answer. Not necessarily a new or surprising answer, but an answer nonetheless.\n\nA cognitive dissonance that becomes unbearable is a fair description of how more than a few Americans feel today. This cognitive dissonance led to the victory of Donald Trump in the last election, a perplexing yet tolerable political outcome. This cognitive dissonance, when it gets more severe, can lead to much more dangerous outcomes.\n\nSo, what did we learn that is new?\n\nWe learned -- yet again -- that the current head of the U.S. government does not condemn such bad people in the harshest terms possible (and not because of his tendency for politeness). Erick-Woods Erickson, the conservative blogger, made this point succinctly in his call for moral clarity: \"this is the same president who routinely mocked and attacked Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for failing to call Islamic radicalism by its name. In Charlottesville, evil has a name, and it is white supremacy.\"\n\nThis is not the first time I write such a thing, and I have the feeling it will not be the last: it is not wise for Jewish institutions, organizations and leaders to paint President Trump as an ally of anti-Semitism. First, because it is very unlikely that he is anti-Semitic. Second, because such accusations, when repeatedly hurled at people, tend to become self-fulfilling prophecies.\n\nA few months ago, when Trump erupted after he was asked a question about anti-Semitism, I wrote that \"in Trump's view, a lot of the growing level of talk about anti-Semitism is no more than a political strategy to destroy his credibility.\" When campuses in several states (anyone here from California?) became an intimidating setting for Jewish students because of attacks from the left, the Jewish establishment did not unite to blame President Obama and his confrontational approach toward Israel for this rise in harassment incidents against Jewish students. But now, when vile attacks on Jews come from the right, many Jewish leaders are ready to point a finger at the White House.\n\nTrump is a divisive figure in a divided and confused world. He has many deficiencies as a leader, some of which were in display when he meekly condemned the violence in Charlottesville. Jews will gain nothing from portraying him as their foe.\n\nMy first visit to Charlottesville was eight years ago or so, to meet Prof. Vanessa Ochs and learn about the invention of new Jewish rituals. Ochs has studied this issue and written about it, and in one of her books she explained that \"two forces have influenced the abundance of ritual innovation. The first is the spiritual stance shaped by democracy and open access, and the second is the dramatic change brought by Jewish feminism.\"\n\nThe story I wrote about Ochs focused more on the feminist aspect. But thinking about recent events in Charlottesville makes one ponder the \"democracy and open access\" aspect of her theory.\n\nIt made me think about the old -- anti-Semitism; and the new -- inventing Jewish ritual; the old -- hatred of Jews; and the new -- America's love of Jews; the old -- Jewish fears (read Ron Kampeas' The Day the Nazi Called Me Shlomo); and the new -- Jews having the confidence to protest and respond without mincing words.", "date": "2017-08-14", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "wgt": 100, "id": 705, "label":

(Instagram/anonymous via Storyful)\n\nAnti-Semitism is again back in the news.\n\nSome of the posters at the Charlottesville white supremacist demonstrations this weekend featured a man taking a hammer to a Star of David -- the biggest threat, the thing that needs to be destroyed. Marchers chanted \"Jews will not replace us\" and \"Blood and soil!\", a direct translation of the Nazi slogan \"blut und boden,\" which plays on the notion of Jews as powerful, dangerous interlopers.\n\nThis comes toward the end of a summer that included the Chicago Dyke March ejecting participants with a Star of David on a gay pride flag on the misguided-at-best grounds that it went \"against the march's anti-racist core values\" and heated debates about whether Gal Gadot, an Ashkenazi Israeli, is a person of color. Particularly in recent years, there has rightfully been increased talk about the ways in which many Ashkenazi Jews in America do have white privilege.\n\nSo are we oppressed? Or what? The reasons that question may feel complicated go back around a thousand years. Since the dawn of modern anti-Semitism, hatred toward Jews has been deeply intertwined with the idea of Jews having unique sorts of advantages.\n\n[Why Jews have a special obligation to resist Trump]\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Jews were barred from many trades and professions, and it was sometimes illegal for Jews to own land. It was convenient for local authorities to permit Jews to work in trades that were repugnant to Christians -- most notably moneylending, which was associated in the Christian world with depravity and sin.\n\nFrom a Jewish perspective, moneylending was a useful line of work for two reasons. First, it was somewhat portable, and when times were lucky it enabled our ancestors to have liquid assets -- both of which were practical during an era when expulsions of Jews from villages and even whole countries were not uncommon. It was also profitable. Most late medieval and early modern European polities taxed Jews at jaw-droppingly high rates, so loaning out money was essential for communities' survival. A very small subset of Jews began handling money because it was a viable option and a practical necessity. And then they were resented for it -- and identified with the work in a way that Christian bankers never were. Even as early as 1233, anti-Semitic drawings depicted the usurious Jew, using many of the same themes one might find in a quick Google search.\n\nMost Jews throughout history lived a fairly precarious existence, economically and otherwise. Many times in history we have been tolerated, and even embraced, by the rulers and locals of our host country. But we have also been subject to expulsions, pogroms, Inquisitions and genocide many times over -- often, indeed, fueled by the trope of the greedy, crooked Jew serving as the scapegoat for other stresses and complexities in society. Often, the shift from living in peace to the bottom dropping out happened very quickly.\n\nSo here's the paradox: Anti-Semitism and Jewish privilege are, and have long been, two sides of the same coin. Even now, I feel it keenly.\n\nOn the one hand, Jews as a category are thus far shielded from the state violence that a lot of other groups are experiencing. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is not seeking us out as a group; we are not being barred from the military or being singled out in a travel ban. Although of course there are Jews of all levels of economic security in this country, American Jews as a collective do have a lot more social and cultural capital than many other groups, and we are not as vulnerable as other communities under attack. The reasons are various; a big one, though, is that many American Jews' families have been established here for a century or more and, over that time, Ashkenazi Jews were able to assimilate into the broader culture and \"become white.\"\n\n[Jews struggled for decades to become white. Now we must give up white privilege to fight racism.]\n\nYet at the same time, anti-Semitism is functioning as it has for centuries. Trump's attacks on \"Soros globalists,\" White House adviser Stephen Miller's claim that a reporter had \"cosmopolitan bias\" (a phrase that has longtime anti-Semitic connotations despite Miller's own Jewish origins), the Star of David superimposed on money in the infamous Trump tweet last year, the dog whistles in the Trump's final campaign ad -- and the posters and chants in Charlottesville -- all depend on a centuries-old, manufactured narrative of Jews as wealthy, powerful and in control. As this rhetoric gets louder, we're seeing more targeted hate: Jewish graveyards have been vandalized at least five times this year, and the Holocaust Memorial in Boston was smashed for the second time this summer on Monday.\n\nThat shift from relative peace to something else can happen so quickly -- in the blink of an eye. Some members of the Jewish community are feeling our centuries-deep intergenerational trauma keenly, experiencing this era as nothing short of terrifying, with memories of pogrom torches and swastika flags looming large.\n\nBut this isn't the time to hunker down. It's the time to stand up. I, for one, have advantages that my ancestors in Europe never dreamed of, and this includes the social capital to fight bigotry with full force and power. We as a community have an obligation to stand up for those who are more vulnerable to both institutional and random attacks, as well as to embody the full bad-assery of an elderly woman photographed on Sunday in New York holding a sign that said, \"I escaped the Nazis once. You will not defeat me now.\"\n\nOur work right now is to fight every kind of bigotry and hate head on.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump's conspiracy theories sound anti-Semitic.

The President refusing for several days to specifically condemn the people holding torches and chanting \"Jews will not replace us.\" People wearing swastikas and doing Nazi salutes in broad daylight. Twitter swelling, even beyond its usual capacity, with the basest of hatred towards Jews.\n\nAt times like these, we look to celebrities and public figures as both a comfort and a barometer of public opinion. Celebrities are people we have anointed as human idols and accepted as tastemakers; they also depend entirely on public good will and act as a mirror of our collective desires and tastes.\n\nSo why did no major celebrities reference the acts of anti-Jewish terrorism that took place in Charlottesville this weekend?\n\nMake no mistake, the white supremacy movement and the alt-right gathering in Charlottesville were explicit attacks against people of color and specifically black people. The event was designed as a protest against the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general who exemplifies what we often pretend is not true: that racism has long been an American value. The weekend was an explicit attack on black people. Every public figure can and should condemn this violent racism publicly.\n\nBut without taking one single thing away from Black, Brown, and queer people, why isn't it possible for celebrities to stand up and say, \"This anti-Jewish hatred is unacceptable\"? Why can't they say, \"I stand with Jews everywhere\"?\n\nCelebrity remarks on Charlottesville, unsurprisingly, are largely absent of references towards race or religion. Major stars like Lady Gaga tweeted that people should \"help\" and \"be kind,\" adding, \"this is not us.\" Kim Kardashian sent general prayers to \"those in Charlottesville & every American who is the target of hate and violence.\" It should shock no one that beloved entertainers erred on the side of banal when confronted with America's most painful problems.\n\nBut many celebrities did address targeted minority groups. They just didn't mention Jews. Demi Lovato tweeted to her 46.9 million followers, \"Black, Muslim, gay, bisexual, trans, etc. you are perfect the way you are and you ARE LOVED.\" Jessica Alba Instagrammed an image and the words, \"Racism and bigotry does not merely exist on the faces of the terrorists marching in Charlottesville.\" (There are no male celebrities mentioned in this article because the most-followed men on Twitter who are not Barack Obama - -- Justin Bieber, Justin Timberlake, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Jimmy Fallon - -- said nothing about Charlottesville at all.) And many celebrities wrote stirring, necessary responses to racism. But nobody mentioned Jews.\n\nLove. Please, I beg of the evil to let go of the prejudice and racism and to #stopthehate. #prayforCharlottesville \u270c\u1f3fc pic.twitter.com/FkPoohkfAO -- Demi Lovato (@ddlovato) August 13, 2017\n\nPublic disavowals of anti-Semitism were hard to find on the internet this week, but there were a few. Angela Merkel, a woman who knows her history, condemned the \"naked racism, anti-Semitism, and hate\" on display in Charlottesville. Human rights activist Shaun King, who is known specifically for anti-racist activism, made room to mention threats against Jews in his tweets. And like it or not, one of the highest profile people who condemned hatred against Jews was the activist Linda Sarsour.\n\nAlmost more terrifying than the pretense that Jews were not directly threatened and endangered by the events in Charlottesville are the many responses to the event that implicate the Holocaust but erase the Jews. In a piece for Refinery 29, Lily Herman pointed out Olivia Wilde's Instagram response, which encouraged support for two groups: \"immigrants and African Americans.\" Wilde called for the protection of \"the potential victims of the alt-right.\" She called the events \"unvarnished Naziism.\" She did everything except mention the word \"Jew.\" Bernie Sanders, who perhaps more than Wilde is reasonably expected to call things what they are, tweeted that the events were a \"provocative effort by Neo-Nazis to foment racism and hatred and create violence.\" But what about the efforts of Neo-Nazis to foment anti-Semitism? \"Call it out for what it is,\" Sanders tweeted, with no hint of irony. Besides, is a person wearing a swastika, doing a Nazi salute, and chanting \"Jews, Jews, Jews\" really a \"neo\" anything? What is this reticence to name things when it comes to talking about anti-Semitism?\n\nThe Holocaust is a staple of pop culture. It is evergreen, inexhaustible tragedy porn. It is a font of entertainment. Americans are aware of and educated about the Holocaust compared to every other tragedy throughout history directly because of its role as a storytelling genre. Americans have been entertained and moved by the Holocaust our entire lives. So why, as Nazis begin to gather publicly, is it so hard for our most beloved pop culture leaders to label them for what they are?\n\nThe use of the word \"Nazi\" and references to the Holocaust as a comparison for, rather than an explanation for, what is happening right now is a strange trend. Many seem to see the hatred and violence gaining traction now as a new brand of Naziism - -- one that targets race instead of religion. That interpretation reveals the impoverishment of our cultural understanding of the Nazis. The Nazis always targeted multiple groups. The Nazis always discriminated on the basis of race and ethnicity. Just ask African Germans. Just ask Romani people.\n\nJust ask Jews.", "date": "2017-08-14", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri":

Why do progressives struggle to recognize that?\n\nBabe.com describes itself as a website \"for girls who don't give a fuck.\" True to form, after the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville they published a piece titled \"We're not going to fuck you, you Nazi losers,\" by Dana Schwartz. \"If you're a 20-year-old pretending to be a Nazi, you're not a bad boy; you're a racist virgin so humiliated by his own sexual inadequacy and terrified at rejection that you'll blame your feelings of weakness on some unseen Liberal Agenda,\" she wrote. \"First and foremost, the neo-Nazi alt-right movement is about racism. Second, it's about sexual insecurity.\"\n\nJezebel's Kelly Stout did not see the essay as an act of criticism or humor by an established journalist, comedian, and young adult author. Instead, in her own essay (let that sink in), she accused Schwartz of being \"a white woman who uses a tragedy to promote her brand\" and that she \"should be embarrassed.\" Stout concludes by arguing that \"the Nazis in Virginia weren't really there to protest white women's right to be alive. And the violence in Virginia does not cry out for a response from sassy white women who know a thing or two about virgins living in their moms' basements.\"\n\nBut here's the catch: Schwartz is a prominent Jewish journalist and an outspoken target of white supremacist harassment. Assuming Stout is aware of the Nazi position on Jewry, and of Schwartz's identity, it's ambiguous whether she is arguing that whiteness cancels out Jewishness or whether she hadn't picked up on Schwartz's identity beyond \"white woman.\"\n\nIt's certainly true that structural racism in the U.S. does not primarily target Jews, and to focus only on anti-Semitism would be myopic. But it's a stretch to say that Jews responding in a personal way to a neo-Nazi rally are centering themselves, and it's untenable in the context of Charlottesville to discuss white Jews simply as white people in need of etiquette instruction from fellow-progressive. While we should defend groups we're not part of, we are also part of a group currently under attack.\n\nProgressives in America pride themselves on being hyperaware of the persecution of minority groups of all kinds -- blacks, women, LGBT people, immigrants -- but they have a blind spot. The left first needs to recognize the very real, immediate threat of anti-Semitism in Trump's America, and to acknowledge anti-Semitism as its own axis of oppression.\n\nThe neo-Nazis in Virginia made very clear that, contra Stout, they were protesting certain white women's right to be alive. At the torch-lit rally on Friday night, the marchers chanted, \"Jews will not replace us.\" On Saturday, while holding Sabbath, the worshippers of Congregation Beth Israel in Charlottesville were terrorized by camouflage-wearing neo-Nazis with semiautomatic rifles, chants of \"sieg heil,\" swastika flags, and threats to burn down the synagogue.\n\n\"Local police faced an unprecedented problem that day, but make no mistake, Jews are a specific target of these groups, and despite nods of understanding from officials about our concerns -- and despite the fact that the mayor himself is Jewish -- we were left to our own devices,\" Alan Zimmerman, the president of the congregation, wrote. \"The fact that a calamity did not befall the Jewish community of Charlottesville on Saturday was not thanks to our politicians, our police, or even our own efforts, but to the grace of God.\"\n\nFor yet more evidence, see Elle Reeve's documentary short for Vice News, in which white supremacist Christopher Cantwell says, \"I'm here to spread ideas, talk, in the hopes that somebody more capable will come along ... somebody like Donald Trump who does not give his daughter to a Jew,\" referring to Ivanka Trump's marriage to Jared Kushner. As Emma Green wrote at The Atlantic, \"Of course there are neo-Nazis in our time. There are those who hate Jews in every time. It's a hatred that easily flickers between the universal and the particular, melding with the similarly particular hatreds of blacks and immigrants and other minority groups.\"\n\nAnd yet, despite this preponderance of evidence, there was a certain silence surrounding anti-Semitism over the weekend. \"In addition to the horror of watching those hateful humans march in broad daylight without fearing any consequences,\" Lily Herman wrote at Refinery29, \"I found it disturbing that many people, including liberals and progressives, didn't acknowledge the hateful anti-Semitic comments made by these Nazis. In some cases, they tried to argue that they didn't happen.\" Senator Bernie Sanders tweeted about the \"provocative effort by Neo-Nazis to foment racism\" without mentioning anti-Semitism. \"This strange in-between of calling out Nazis without directly acknowledging their hate towards Jews made me heave a very, very long sigh.\"\n\nRecognizing that anti-Semitism exists is, in a sense, the simple part. Recognizing anti-Semitism for what it is -- a specific form of bigotry, rooted less in a sense of Jewish inferiority, than in just-as-warped beliefs of Jewish superiority -- gets more challenging. It requires a rethinking of terms on a fairly profound level. The common progressive framework, in which white people and people of color are binary categories, makes sense in many contexts. But in the case of Charlottesville and the \"alt-right,\" this approach erases a demographic who are white but also despised by white supremacists: white Jews, which is to say, most American Jews.\n\nIn The Washington Post, Yair Rosenberg asks that everyone set aside questions of Jews' whiteness or lack thereof, and focus on the fact that \"white supremacists have already made their decision\" that Jews are not white. As Herman noted, \"While many people identify Jewish Americans as simply 'white' these days, some may be surprised to learn that this is a relatively new mainstream notion that has surfaced in the past half century. Before that, many Americans bought into the belief that Jews were ethnically inferior white people and treated them as such for centuries.\"\n\nI'd argue that we have to address those questions head-on, but doing so takes about two seconds: American Jews are white. Most of us are, anyway, and that's how we're usually treated. But that's neither here nor there, where anti-Semitism is concerned, because anti-Semitism concerns itself with Jewishness, not whiteness.\n\nAnti-Semitism must be fought, but on its own terms. This means not trying to fit anti-Semitism into the framework of other forms of bigotry. It's not racism. It's not classism. Treating anti-Semitism as its own axis of oppression -- intersecting with others, but still distinct -- allows for precision, and avoids over- or understating the case.\n\nThe left also needs to understand that neither socioeconomic privilege nor white privilege guard against anti-Semitism. In fact, the perceived privilege of Jews is precisely why many anti-Semites despise them -- consider the conspiracy theory that Jews control the media and Wall Street -- and why many progressives are incapable of classifying Jews as a marginalized minority. It's true that in material terms, on the whole, Jews in America are doing fine. But the consider the psychological terror of being a Jew in Charlottesville last weekend. Consider feeling trapped in your house of worship while being watched by extremely well-armed people who want you dead. Consider the rise in anti-Semitism in 2017, no doubt encouraged by a president who -- his Jewish relatives and advisors be damned -- sees \"many sides\" to neo-Nazism.\n\nScapegoating Jews has long been a way to avoid holding society's most powerful actors to account. So when Jews react viscerally to anti-Semitism -- even white Jews, even privileged Jews, even internet-famous Jews -- don't take them to task for centering themselves in a conversation about bigotry.

Marchers chanted, \"Jews will not replace us\" and \"Blood and soil!\" -- a direct translation of the Nazi slogan \"blut und boden,\" which plays on the notion of Jews as powerful, dangerous interlopers.\n\nThis comes toward the end of a summer that included the Chicago Dyke March ejecting participants with a Star of David on a gay pride flag on the misguided-at-best grounds that it went \"against the march's anti-racist core values\" and heated debates about whether Gal Gadot, an Ashkenazi Israeli, is a person of color. Particularly in recent years, there has rightfully been increased talk about the ways in which many Ashkenazi Jews in America do have white privilege.\n\nSo are we oppressed? Or what? The reasons that question may feel complicated go back around a thousand years. Since the dawn of modern anti-Semitism, hatred toward Jews has been deeply intertwined with the idea of Jews having unique sorts of advantages.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Jews were barred from many trades and professions, and it was sometimes illegal for Jews to own land. It was convenient for local authorities to permit Jews to work in trades that were repugnant to Christians -- most notably money-lending, which was associated in the Christian world with depravity and sin.\n\nFrom a Jewish perspective, money-lending was a useful line of work for two reasons. First, it was somewhat portable, and when times were lucky it enabled our ancestors to have liquid assets -- both of which were practical during an era when expulsions of Jews from villages and even whole countries were not uncommon. It was also profitable. Most late medieval and early modern European polities taxed Jews at jaw-droppingly high rates, so loaning out money was essential for communities' survival. A very small subset of Jews began handling money because it was a viable option and a practical necessity. And then they were resented for it -- and identified with the work in a way that Christian bankers never were. Even as early as 1233, anti-Semitic drawings depicted the usurious Jew, using many of the same themes one might find in a quick Google search.\n\nMost Jews throughout history lived a fairly precarious existence, economically and otherwise. Many times in history we have been tolerated, and even embraced, by the rulers and locals of our host country. But we have also been subject to expulsions, pogroms, inquisitions and genocide many times over -- often, indeed, fueled by the trope of the greedy, crooked Jew serving as the scapegoat for other stresses and complexities in society. Often, the shift from living in peace to the bottom dropping out happened very quickly.\n\nSo here's the paradox: Anti-Semitism and Jewish privilege are, and have long been, two sides of the same coin. Even now, I feel it keenly.\n\nOn the one hand, Jews as a category are thus far shielded from the state violence that a lot of other groups are experiencing. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is not seeking us out as a group; we are not being barred from the military or being singled out in a travel ban. Although of course there are Jews of all levels of economic security in this country, American Jews as a collective do have a lot more social and cultural capital than many other groups, and we are not as vulnerable as other communities under attack. The reasons are various; a big one, though, is that many American Jews' families have been established here for a century or more and, over that time, Ashkenazi Jews were able to assimilate into the broader culture and \"become white.\"\n\nYet at the same time, anti-Semitism is functioning as it has for centuries. President Donald Trump's attacks on \"Soros globalists,\" White House adviser Stephen Miller's claim that a reporter had \"cosmopolitan bias\" (a phrase that has longtime anti-Semitic connotations despite Miller's own Jewish origins), the Star of David superimposed on money in the infamous Trump tweet last year, the dog whistles in the Trump's final campaign ad -- and the posters and chants in Charlottesville -- all depend on a centuries-old, manufactured narrative of Jews as wealthy, powerful and in control. As this rhetoric gets louder, we're seeing more targeted hate: Jewish graveyards have been vandalized at least five times this year, and the Holocaust Memorial in Boston was smashed for the second time this summer on Monday.\n\nThat shift from relative peace to something else can happen so quickly -- in the blink of an eye. Some members of the Jewish community are feeling our centuries-deep intergenerational trauma keenly, experiencing this era as nothing short of terrifying, with memories of pogrom torches and swastika flags looming large.\n\nBut this isn't the time to hunker down. It's the time to stand up. I, for one, have advantages that my ancestors in Europe never dreamed of, and this includes the social capital to fight bigotry with full force and power. We as a community have an obligation to stand up for those who are more vulnerable to both institutional and random attacks, as well as the powerful image of an 89-year-old woman photographed on Sunday in New York holding a sign that said: \"I escaped the Nazis once. You will not defeat me now.\"\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nDanya Ruttenberg, of Evanston, is rabbi-in-residence at Avodah, a Jewish service corps, and author of \"Nurture the Wow: Finding Spirituality in

I didn't choose to be one. I was born this way. I'm a Jew because my mother is one and her mother was one, and it goes back for as many generations as we can count. Being Jewish isn't just about practicing a religion, observing 613 commandments of the Torah, or merely being a member of a religion, Judaism. Being Jewish is far more than a religion; it's also a nation, a people, and an ethnicity.\n\nLet's get rid of a modern myth that plagues the Jewish People. Jews are not white. Jews come in all colors and every shade from dark to pale and being Jewish has absolutely nothing to do with skin color. We are not Anglo or The White Colonizer. We didn't colonize Europe or the United States. The Jew isn't the White Man who discovered or conquered America and we certainly didn't lead the genocide in Africa or the slave trade either. Jews didn't discover America or colonize any region.\n\nIn fact, it is the Jewish People who refused to bow down to the colonizers over thousands of years which may be the root of antisemitism and a general distrust and hatred of the Jewish People to this very day.\n\nWhen a people have no understanding of who they are, they're unable to define themselves. In today's world, most people don't read books and certainly take less interest in actual history. With Internet, social media and YouTube, all people are in danger of becoming what other people want them to be. Propaganda, misinformation, truth or lies may be spread with the click of a button.\n\nJust as Native Americans (mistakenly named, Indians), are indigenous to America and the Black African is indigenous to Africa, the Jewish People are indigenous to the Land of Israel.\n\nThis brings us to the definition of indigenous and why the modern conflict that plagues the region of Israel and the Middle East.\n\nIt's as simple as knowing history.\n\nAs Benjamin Franklin so eloquently stated, \"We are all born ignorant, but one must work hard to remain stupid.\" Just take a few minutes to learn the history and it all becomes clear.\n\nWhere do Jews come from and what is a Jew? According to any dictionary, a Jew is defined as:\n\nThe original name for the people we now call Jews was Hebrews, a name included in the first book ever written, known to most of the world as, the Old Testament, AKA the Torah. In Genesis, the word Hebrew/Ivri is first used to describe Abraham. Jews are also known as Israelites, because Jews are descendants of Jacob, who was given a second name, Israel. In Hebrew, Yehudi comes from Judah, the name of one of Jacob's twelve sons. Judah was the ancestor of one of the tribes of Israel, which was named after him. Very simply, Judaism literally means Judah-ism; the religion of Judah. Jews or Yehudim also means \"People of G-d\", because the first three letters of Yehudah are the same as the first three letters of G-d's four-letter name.\n\nThere are Jews of every color and origin; dark, pale, Asian, blond, red-head, and converts who come from every race. From atheist and secular, Reform, Conservative and Orthodox to Modern, Hasidic, Chabad, etc. If your mother was/is Jewish, you're a Jew and all Jews are equally Jewish. We are a People, a Nation, and we all have equal indigenous rights to the Land of Israel.\n\nWe know from ancient history that the Jewish People are not only a religion, but a tribal people. Judah was only one of the 12 tribes of Israel. After the death of King Solomon, the Hebrew Nation was divided into two kingdoms: Judah and Israel. Yehudi described anyone from Judah's kingdom including the tribes of Judah, Benjamin and Levi, as well as scattered peoples from other tribes.\n\nThe most obvious biblical example is in Megilat Esther where Mordechai is referred to as both a Yehudi and a member of the Benjamin tribe. In the 6th century B.C.E., Israel was conquered by Assyria, sending the ten tribes into exile. Judah's kingdom was the only one to remain to carry on Abraham's heritage. Judah's People were known globally as Yehudim or Jews, the name that is used to this day.\n\nWhen the Tribe of Judah returned from captivity, they were known as Jews, belonging to the land Judea - the Greek and Roman equivalent of Judah.\n\nWhen Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, Judea was part of the Hill Country containing four other regions, the coastal plain, the Shephelah AKA Shfelat Yehuda, the Judean foothills, the Negev in the south, and the Wilderness. The Hill Country was a rough stony land including a tall open plateau: Jerusalem. The Wilderness was a barren region where the Judean mountains on the east side sloped down to the Dead Sea, the lowest place on earth.\n\nIn New Testament times, the population of Judea was exclusively Jewish. The plateau of Jerusalem also included the incomplete Temple of Herod on Mount Zion.\n\nThe palace of Herod stood on the west side of the Jewish Temple Mount. The fortress of Antonia and Roman auxiliary troops occupied the area north of the Temple Mount.\n\nThe claim by modern-day Arabs to the denomination \"Palestinian\" is false. The term is believed to come from the Egyptian and Hebrew word peleshet, which loosely translates as, migratory, and was used to describe the inhabitants northeast of Egypt, known as the Philistines. Philistines were closely related to the Greeks and lack ethnic, historic, or linguistic relationship to the Arabs who conquered what is now known as Israel and Gaza back in the 12th Century BCE.\n\nThe term peleshet is mentioned in the Torah at least 250 times. The word Palestine or Filastin does not appear in the Koran even once.\n\nAfter World War I, the name Palestine was given to the territory placed under British Mandate, including not only present-day Israel but also present-day Jordan. The international media were responsible for labeling Jews, not Arabs, living under British Mandate as Palestinians. It was only after the Six Day War in 1967 that these Arabs officially adopted the identity. The term Palestinian for an Arab group is a modern political creation without any historic or ethnic grounds.\n\nIt should be noted that the definition of the name the modern Palestinians adopted also means \"invader from the sea\" - not a coincidence.\n\nArab writer and journalist Joseph Farah declared:\n\n\"There has never been a land known as Palestine governed by Palestinians. Palestinians are Arabs, indistinguishable from Jordanians, Syrians, Iraqis, or Egyptians.\"\n\nThe fact remains that Arabs control 99.9 percent of Middle East land. Israel represents one-tenth of one percent of the landmass. Ultimately this is what the fighting in Israel is about; 1/10 of 1%. As the world slowly awakens to the horrors of Islamic terrorism worldwide, recognition of the ultimate goal has become apparent. They want it all and won't stop killing us, fighting, and roadblocking peace talks until the last Jew is gone from the Middle East.\n\nAccording to the Israeli historian Benny Morris:\n\n\"In ancient times, the core of the Jewish state was the hill country of Judea, Samaria, and Galilee. Areas in mainland Israel such as Caesarea, Jaffa, and Ashkelon were centers of paganism in the Hellenistic and Roman periods and did not make up the heart of biblical Israel. Yet despite these historical facts, too many people support relinquishing Israeli control over Judea and Samaria, even though the area is richer in Jewish history than Arab history.\"\n\nSo what does it mean to be indigenous to a land? According to Ryan Bellerose, a Native Metis of Canada, it's a debate of morals. Indigenous is often misused and is not defined by who was there to begin with. It's not about physical origin but cultural conception on an ancestral land with association to pre-invasion conquerors. Indigenous is congruous with where a people becomes a nation; a group with its own language, traditions, and culture. Blood is sacred as is ancestry but indigenous status goes beyond blood. There must also be retention of heritage.\n\nThis is the very root of why our skin color has nothing to do with our heritage and status as a Jewish People. Maintaining Indigenous status comes with responsibility and one may not exist as both oppressor of the Indigenous Native and BE the Indigenous Native. In the case of Israel, the People of Judah, the Hebrews, the Israelites, are the Indigenous People.\n\nIn the case of the people who have reinvented themselves in modern-day history as \"Palestinians\"; they don't get to be occupied, oppressed, and indigenous while they attack, maim, and murder Jews daily, thus embodying the very definition of oppressor and colonizer. It is true that the Jewish People lived in Exile for 2000 years, however this was done in order to displace us so that the Greeks, Romans, British, and Arabs could settle the land for themselves.\n\nThis is called colonization. The tactics of colonization have been used since the beginning of time along with genocide. It's been used on Native Americans, the Kurds, the Circassians, Armenians, Aborigines, and on several native tribes in South and Central America and let us not forget Africa, and modern-day Syria.\n\nIndigenous status is permanent. It makes no difference what is reported or not reported in the media. Neither antisemitism nor Palestinian propaganda will prevail at driving the Jewish People from our rightful indigenous homeland. The bottom line is Jews are being murdered and attacked daily in our ancestral land. No good person ever woke up one morning and said, \"I think I'll go kill some Jews\". People who do that are evil.\n\nJewish People must recognize and take ownership of the fact that Jews are the good guys. Terrorism and murder are undeniably, absolutely evil. Terrorism and murder are currently being justified as legitimate reaction to \"oppression\" and \"occupation\" by the big bad Israelis. This lie is agreed upon and perpetuated by the UN, liberal groups, the media, and even Jewish organizations. We need to stop worrying about the lack of hashtags and media coverage of our tragedies and start standing up for our indigenous rights.\n\nConsistent factual truth: Jews are the indigenous natives of Israel and we don't need the permission of the UN or the media to exist and live without persecution and constant threat of maiming and murder by a group of people who think they can strong-arm and conquer the Jewish People in our own land.\n\nOur rights to be in Israel, have nothing to do with modern genocide such as the Holocaust, UN resolutions, or green lines drawn by the British or whoever. Our right to exist here were written in the most important book ever written, the Bible. We have been kicked out of our land many times but now we're back. Arabs have an ancestral land too and it's NOT Israel. It's time to stop living like colonized natives and stand up for what is rightfully and morally correct.\n\nWe don't need NYT, CNN or BBC to justify our mourning or the UN to give us permission to exist. Israel is the ancestral land of the Jews. Jews belong to the Land Of Israel. Sadly, the Indigenous Native People of North America fought for their rights and they lost. Crimes against humanity, genocide, and colonization ensued.\n\nThe Jewish People wandered the desert and lived in exile for thousands of years, but in 1948 it was the Jews who won the war.\n\nFor thousands of years, Jews have been exiled and forced out of their land. When there were no alternatives or options, and Jews lacked the power and organization to enforce the rule of law the Jewish People had no choice but to live as strangers in Exile. Now Jews do have a country, laws, an army, and independence.\n\nIt's any Jew's job to know their own origin That job is not a burden; it's a holy and precious gift. Jews are not \"White\" - Jews are Jewish. One cannot be both the oppressed AND the oppressor. Being a \"White Man\" is not defined by skin color alone and being a Jew absolutely excludes the Jewish People from being \"White\" regardless of how light their skin might be.....", "date":

It was only after great efforts by influential figures that Sweden finally agreed, near the end of 1943, to take in Denmark's Jews.\n\nDenmark was the only conquered country in which almost all of its citizens, including King Christian and the royal family, sought to aid Jews and hide them. After receiving the okay from Sweden, they smuggled some 7,200 Jews and some 700 of their non-Jewish relatives to the neighboring country in an organized operation that lasted for three weeks in ships, motorboats, and smaller boats.

Let me tell you, as Paul Harvey would put it, the rest of the story.\n\nColumbus postponed his voyage a couple of days because he was supposed to set sail July 31, which was Tisha B'Av, the ninth day of the Jewish month of Av, which is the most tragic day in the Jewish calendar, a day on which all the great tragedies that ever happened to the Jewish people occurred.\n\nWas Columbus Jewish? You bet he was, and there is a good deal of proof, but that's a subject for another article.\n\nIt was on that Tisha B'Av in 1492 that Queen Isabella of Spain's Edict of Expulsion of the Jews under the Inquisition took effect. It declared that all Jews who had not left Spain since the signing of the edict four months earlier had to convert or die. Then the government made it almost impossible for Jews to leave the country because it abducted the children of those who tried.\n\nEven if one succeeded in leaving, where would one go? Few countries welcomed Jews, and it was a treacherous journey getting anywhere. Many fled to Portugal, but the Inquisition soon followed them there.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, some fled to the New World, to places like Bahia and Recife, Brazil, because it was controlled by the Dutch, who more or less welcomed Jews. But Portugal soon conquered Brazil, and the Jews had to flee again. Some wound up in New Amsterdam, which soon became New York, and others in the emerging communities of the Caribbean like Curacao, Suriname, Santo Domingo and Jamaica.\n\nMany openly converted to Christianity but secretly remained Jews. The Christians called them Marranos (pigs). They had to be especially careful because if they were caught not burning their stoves on Saturday or not eating on Yom Kippur or doing a Jewish custom or not showing up for church on Sunday, the Inquisition would arrest them, torture them on racks that tore their bodies apart, force them to inform on other secret Jews, burn them at the auto-da-f\u00e9 and take all their assets.\n\nRabbi Mark Hillel Kunis (right) walks with a member of the Nicaragua Jewish community, many of whom are descended from Jews who were forced to convert to Christianity by the Spanish Inquisition.\n\nCan you imagine the terror this engendered? No wonder they were careful not to tell their children much about being Jewish, for fear it might spill out when they played with Christian children.\n\nNow how long do you think being Jewish would have lasted for these Jews -- one generation or two, 50 or 100 years? How about 525 years!\n\nHow amazing is the Jewish spirit, the Jewish soul? A full 525 years after the signing of the Edict of Expulsion, the Jewish soul emerges as strong as ever in Nicaragua, which in 2012 had only 50 Jews.\n\nIn mid-June I received a call from Kulanu (Hebrew for \"all of us\"). It's an amazing organization that helps emerging Jewish communities in Latin America, Africa and India.\n\nThe vice president of Kulanu, Bonnie Sussman, is the wife of a colleague I have known for 25 years, Rabbi Gerry Sussman. Bonnie told me about this mission to Nicaragua and asked whether I would be interested in being part of a beit din of three Orthodox rabbis to convert those who are descendants of Jews or, for some surprising reason, those whose souls have been attracted to Judaism.\n\nWould I? My whole life has been about helping that pintle Yid, that Jewish soul, emerge from those who have, for one reason or another, been estranged from Jewish life.\n\nBut I told her my father's health was failing, and I was not sure I would be able to make it.\n\nRight after the shiva, she called again, and although I needed to go to Florida to clean out my father's condo and begin to put his affairs in order, Cheryl and I agreed. The timing wasn't great, but this was an opportunity we couldn't afford to miss.\n\nNicaragua is a poor country. Hotel accommodations are rather limited. It's near the equator and therefore always very warm. The home where we conducted the conversions -- although owned by two successful people, Moshe Henriquez, a radiation oncologist, and his wife, Yehudit, a Supreme Court lawyer -- was not air-conditioned because it's too expensive.\n\nThe conditions may have been difficult, but the spirit was inspiring. Dr. Moshe had assembled a small but faithful community that had studied Judaism and prayed Shabbat services together for years.\n\nI had recently read an amazing book, \"Jewish Pirates of the Caribbean,\" which tells about Jews in the 16th and 17th centuries who owned ships and became pirates against the Spanish and Portuguese who betrayed their people. They did this in concert with England, which, in turn, promised a place in the British colonies for Jews.\n\nOne of the Jewish pirate heroes was Moshe Cohen Henriquez. To my amazement, Dr. Moshe Henriquez is a direct descendent of the great Jewish pirate Moshe Cohen Henriquez.\n\nCheryl and I were amazed by the spirit of these people. They don't have much, but they have sacrificed so much just to be Jewish.\n\nAs we conducted the conversions, many would come early in the morning and sit as long as 10 hours to wait for their turn at the beit din. The love in their hearts for Hashem and Torah and the glow on their faces when they emerged from the mikvah as Jews were so inspiring.\n\nCheryl was the official mikvah lady, supervising the women as they immersed. She did an outstanding job of making the women feel comfortable as she enthusiastically led them through the process even though she doesn't speak more than a couple of words of Spanish.\n\nThe women approached the mikvah with a good deal of trepidation because they had to remove their clothes, and, truth be told, many were afraid of going underwater. Let me share with you some of Cheryl's stories.\n\nSabrina, about 14 years old, came into the mikvah with such exuberance and utter joy and excitement that she bounded down the steps to the ritual bath. When Cheryl told her to go into the water, she practically dived in as the waters splashed all over. When reciting the blessings after Cheryl, she shouted them with all her might with joy and happiness.\n\nThe Kulanu mission converted 114 Nicaraguans, more than twice as many Jews as lived in the country five years ago.\n\nShe recited the Shehecheyanu with love and devotion that are seldom seen among Jews praying today. The whole mikvah rocked with her enthusiasm.\n\nChaviva was so anxious and nervous as she entered the mikvah, but when she came out, there were incredible tears of joy as she hugged and kissed and hugged and kissed Cheryl while she touched her heart.\n\nWith a translator, she later explained that she had four children and a few grandchildren. They all had converted, and she was the only one left. She has a son who is in Lakewood, N.J., studying to be a rabbi.\n\nGisselle, the wife of Akiva Simcha Fernandez, the leader of the second group we converted, is blind. She is reserved and shy. Cheryl guided her into the mikvah as she clutched the handrail. She also was terrified of going underwater.\n\nWhen she emerged from the mikvah, it was as if she could see through blind eyes as her whole face radiated with the joy of the mikvah experience. This quiet, reserved personality was transformed into a beautiful, boisterous, laughing and joyful character.\n\nLet me share some of the stories I came away with from the interviews of the beit din.\n\nWe asked everyone when he or she became interested in Judaism. One young man said it was when his grandfather died and left him a tallit. He asked what it was, and his search led him to become Jewish like his grandfather.\n\nOne woman said she was told as a girl not to go out on Friday nights and not to eat pork.\n\nOne young man said that only when he asked questions about Jewish things he had seen did his grandmother tell him he was descended from Jews.\n\nIt was not unusual for some of these people to be attracted first to Messianic groups such as Jews for Jesus because they were told that this was the real Judaism. One who did join told us he only left when he met a distant cousin who had left and somehow became a frum Jew; that's how he found out what real Judaism is.\n\nI have each conversion candidate sign and read out loud a conversion oath at the beit din in which he or she promises to live a Jewish life of mitzvot and Jewish customs. One woman just broke down crying as she read it. She explained that she had been trying to get to that point her whole life.\n\nThe last book of Torah, Devarim, tells us again and again that the Jewish people will be dispersed throughout the world because of their sins. In other words, Jews will be found everywhere.\n\nWell, in late July, Cheryl and I found Jews in the most unlikely place: Managua, Nicaragua. It's an amazing testament to the Jewish soul that it somehow survives even there.\n\nLet me end by telling you about what happened after the weddings on our last day there. The final count of the beit din was 17 circumcisions -- 10 adults and seven children -- 114 conversions and 24 separate weddings. We helped birth two new Jewish communities.\n\nThey are in desperate need of Spanish siddurim and chumashim and tallises.\n\nOnce converted, all those who were married had to be married again under a chuppah. That, in and of itself, was amazing and joyous.\n\nAs people began to leave, I asked for help forming a minyan to say Kaddish for my father. Soon, about 40 came outside the wedding hall with me (where it was cooler) to daven the Maariv service. These people davened with such enthusiasm -- with full voices on a main street.\n\nThink about that. These were Jews who, until recently, had hidden their identity for 525 years. Now, outside on a main drag, in front of a Christian world, they proudly prayed out loud, with all their hearts, for all the world to see.\n\nLet us all be inspired to match their enthusiasm for Hashem and His Torah way of life. Amen!\n\nRabbi Mark Hillel Kunis is the spiritual leader of Congregation Shaarei Shamayim in Toco Hills. \"For more information on Kulanu and the important work it does, visit www.kulanu.org.",

As everyone knows, the great Jewish communities of Eastern Europe, the Muslim world and Russia have declined precipitously as a result of the Holocaust, expulsions and voluntary emigration.\n\nIn some places, like the UK, Sweden, France, Poland and Venezuela, Jews who had no problem with diaspora life a short time ago are discovering that their neighbors (in the case of the UK, Sweden and France, we are particularly talking about their new Muslim neighbors) are not as friendly as they previously thought.\n\nGood riddance to those places, many say. And I agree. In fact, in light of recent developments, I have decided to change my general recommendation about aliyah to Israel. In the past, my view has been that you should make aliyah only if you find yourself driven by love for the idea of a Jewish state, or if your life or well-being are endangered by Jew-hatred.\n\nMy new advice is this: if you are a Jew and not an anti-Zionist (either the religious or leftist kind), then it is past time for you to make aliyah.\n\nRight now some of you are saying that you are perfectly happy in London or Los Angeles and I have no right to tell you what to do. That's true, but I'm doing it anyway.\n\nHere are some reasons to not make aliyah: if you are middle class, your standard of living will probably decline. If you live in the US now, you will almost certainly end up with less living space. If you are young you will have to do military service, and if you are older your children will. If you are a professional like a doctor, lawyer or architect, you will have to jump through hoops to be permitted to practice your profession in Israel. Unless you are lucky enough to have a Jewish education, you will have to learn the Hebrew language starting from zero. There will probably be a war here within the next couple of years, during which rockets will hit our cities.\n\nI could go on, but you get the idea. So why am I urging that you make aliyah? Two reasons:\n\nOne is that I care about the survival of the Jewish people as a people, and I am convinced that this depends on the survival of the Jewish state. And the Jewish state needs you. We need your Jewish DNA, we need you and your children to be soldiers, and we need your children and their children to give birth to more Jews. This is the place to do it, the place in which it will be most likely that they will remain Jews.\n\nLet me interject a short true story: I knew a man in California that I will call Avraham. Avraham was a survivor of the camps and an artist. His wife and children and other relatives had all been murdered by the Nazis. Only Hashem knows how he managed to survive. In America he painted pictures of destroyed synagogues that he remembered from before, married a nice (non-Jewish) Mexican woman and had numerous children. \"This is my answer to the Nazis,\" he said. When he died and was buried, I went to a big party at his house in his honor. I looked around, and there was his big Mexican family. Not one of his children or his wife had wanted to convert to Judaism or had the slightest interest in it. There was absolutely nothing Jewish left except his paintings and some incomprehensible books that the family would give away. So much for his answer to the Nazis.\n\nThe other reason is that the diaspora is coming apart. Europe's Islamification is proceeding apace, and will either make countries like France or the UK as inhospitable to Jews as Iraq is today, or give rise to a bloody civil struggle, like in Syria. Do you want to live - do you want your children to live - in an Iraq or a Syria?\n\nAmerica is another, different story. Although I wouldn't try to predict what will happen there as a result of its crazy politics and growing social unrest, one thing that I can be sure of is that the non-Orthodox community is hemorrhaging Jews. More than half are intermarried, and the ones that aren't are having children at a rate way below what is required to maintain a stable population. Many are drifting off into a totally secular condition, where all that is left of their Jewishness is nostalgia for \"Jewish food.\" Many of them, formerly traditional pro-Israel Jewish liberals, have become political progressives and adopted the conventional wisdom of the Left, which sees Israel as the villain in the Mideast conflict. This is the lost generation of American Jews, and most of them are lost forever. Those who still crave some connection to either Judaism or the Jewish people might or might not find it in Israel - but they certainly won't find it in America.\n\nOrthodox American Jews do have more stable communities, but the demise of the \"lost generation\" will leave them a tiny minority in an increasingly hostile gentile society. What progressives call tolerance and diversity, things that should theoretically make the lives of all minorities better, are actually forms of identity politics in which Jews, especially visible Jews, are the losers. Clearly, the writing is on the wall.\n\nAnd despite all of the things on my list above about why aliyah and living in Israel can be hard, the fact is that Israelis, according to the 2017 World Happiness Report, are happier than the great majority of people in the world, coming in 11 out of 155 countries (the US only made 14 place). Israelis prove it by having children: even secular people have 3-4 children, and religious families even more. There is something special here. In my opinion, it is a sense of national purpose that no longer exists in France, for example (in 44 place).\n\nIf you are Jewish, not anti-Zionist (members of Neturei Karta, Jewish Voice for Peace, or If Not Now are excluded from my invitation), then start thinking seriously about aliyah.

Chants included \"Jews will not replace us,\" \"the goyim know,\" and the old Nazi rally slogan \"blood and soil.\" Some marchers wore Nazi armbands and carried swastika flags and signs denouncing Jews as \"Satan's children\" -- boy, Islamic terrorists are vigorously nodding their heads in agreement -- along with a vile range of racist slurs.\n\nOn the alt-right /pol/ 4chan site, a nickname thread for James Fields Jr., the Ohio man accused of running over counter-protesters and killing one woman, suggested \"James 'The Jews went too far so I got my car' Fields\" and \"James 'Mow Down the Kikes, Even the Tykes' Fields.\"\n\nFields is accused of killing by a method often described in do-it-yourself terrorist guides: ramming a car into a crowd, while first waiting until enough people have massed and gathering enough speed to do real damage.\n\nThough many of these haters would chafe at the mere suggestion, it's a devastating cooperative relationship: domestic anti-Semites, while cherry-picking useful tips on online organizing and youth recruitment from Islamist terror groups' successes, are also emboldening terrorists.\n\nSome of the people you'll hear spreading anti-Semitic views are blatant apologists for extremism, justifying a car barreling into an Israeli bus stop or a random knife attack on the street as a legitimate expression of frustration at the lack of a Palestinian state, Jewish victims be damned. And some of the people you'll hear spreading anti-Semitic views, from as overt as holding aloft a neo-Nazi slogan at a rally to covert online trolling, simultaneously fancy themselves to be great foes of al-Qaeda and ISIS as they also denounce Islam and non-white people, places and cultures.\n\nAnd they're helping terrorist organizations.\n\nEveryone who tweets a photo of a Jewish journalist in an oven, who spreads canards about Jews controlling the media and global financial system, who spews hatred for the Jewish people in thinly veiled criticism of the Jewish state is helping terror groups hone a talking point. Every time anti-Semitism is brushed aside as Twitter trolls or spray-painted swastikas on a synagogue and busted-up Jewish headstones are dismissed as youthful pranks, the complacency gives terrorists another reason to believe that they, too, can target the Jewish state and Jewish people with a fair number of westerners looking in the other direction. And when westerners actually do the job of trying to stoke antagonism against Jews, you can basically hear ISIS pulling out the thank you cards.\n\nA culture of anti-Semitism is a fertile ground for breeding extremism and terrorist sympathizers, while a society with no tolerance for anti-Semitism presents a unified front against their agenda.\n\nAn ISIS e-book published in the early days of the Islamic State encouraged readers to check out anti-Israel protests with non-Muslims calling for \"the fall of Zionism,\" if not to draw recruits from this demographic then relying on their rhetoric to hammer away at the \"financial elite.\"\n\nAnother e-book from the terror group on the sacking of Israel spewed blood libel, claimed Jews control social media, called Israel a hotbed of hedonism and cited hoax \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\" as source material. ISIS questioned why Jews were entitled to a homeland after World War II while claiming Judaism was \"imitating the Satanic culture\" and the Star of David was \"a symbol of sorcery.\"\n\nThat's pretty much interchangeable with the neo-Nazi rhetoric spewed on the streets of Charlottesville and by other tentacles of the movement.\n\nWhen it comes to fighting anti-Semitism, we must not only consider who is hurt by the hate but who is served -- and not be afraid to underscore when rhetoric, vandalism, threats and policies are, in a nutshell, hate sponsors of terrorism.", "date": "2017-08-16",

Here's What The Rabbis Did That Day.", "uri": "711081667", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-17T19:46:00Z", "time": "19:46:00", "body": "In the days leading up to last Saturday's Unite the Right rally, the Jews of Charlottesville sensed that the march might put worshippers gathered to celebrate the Jewish Sabbath in danger. They asked the police to provide them with an officer during morning services and were refused, so they hired an armed security guard.\n\nThey also reached out to their friends among Charlotteville's other religious communities, so for some of the rabbis of the Reform Congregation Beth Israel, the day started with a sunrise interfaith service. After that, as anticipated, things got scary. Here's how the rabbis and their congregation experienced the day.\n\n9 a.m. Charlottesville's only synagogue began services an hour earlier than usual to try to avoid any clashes with the rally, slated to start at noon. It didn't work.\n\nSeveral neo-Nazis walked by Congregation Beth Israel, shouting \"There's the synagogue!\" and \"Sieg Heil,\" a Nazi cheer meaning \"Hail Victory.\" For thirty minutes, three men with semi-automatic rifles stood across the street from the synagogue, wrote synagogue president Alan Zimmerman for ReformJudaism.org.\n\nThe rabbi stayed outside to keep watch, and so did a 30-year Navy veteran, John Aguilar, because he \"just felt he should.\" Several non-Jews came to services to show solidarity, Zimmerman wrote, and at least a dozen strangers stopped by to ask if Aguilar and Zimmerman wanted company.\n\nShabbat services \"It just really felt like we were in our own place,\" said Geoff Schmelkin, husband of the synagogue's Rabbi Rachel Schmelkin, in an interview with the Forward. \"Prayers strengthened us and gave us the kind of comfort that we needed. It really felt good to be with the community and to be praying together. ... We were just doing our thing and being resilient in the way that we want to be in the face of a crisis like this.\"\n\nCongregation Beth Israel's stained glass windows blocked the sight and sounds of the rally outside. For two and a half hours, congregants prayed despite the chaos just across the street.\n\nServices conclude, about 11:00 a.m.\n\nThe service ended and people filed out of the synagogue into the main hall for kiddush, the ritual blessing over wine and bread usually combined with snacks and a period of schmoozing. Geoff Schmelkin looked out of the second floor windows to see \"gangs of skinheads\" marching past the synagogue. The sight was \"evocative of the atmosphere of a pogrom,\" he said.\n\nRabbi Thomas Gutherz, Congregation Beth Israel's senior rabbi, said he had not experienced such blatant anti-Semitism from \"white supremacist gangs\" after living in the South for more than two decades.\n\n\"It's just not part of the ordinary experience of Jews,\" he told the Forward.\n\nSaying good-bye\n\nZimmerman's \"heart broke\" as he asked congregants to leave in groups through the back, he wrote.\n\nThe rabbis had realized an attack on the synagogue was a real possibility and removed the Torahs, including a Holocaust scroll.\n\nAn interfaith safe space, 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.\n\nSeveral congregants walked two minutes down the street to First United Methodist Church, which served as a \"safe space\" for counter-protesters during the day, Rachel Schmelkin told the Forward. Among them was her husband, wearing a yarmulke. The short walk was \"tense,\" he said.\n\nThe rabbi and her husband reconnected. She'd been at the church since 8:30 a.m., playing guitar and singing songs of \"love and kindness\" on the steps. She frequently stopped and hurried inside when a lockdown was announced after reports of violence nearby.\n\n\"It was really important for people to have their spirits lifted as they were looking at this hatred,\" she said. \"I wanted to drown out their noise with something beautiful.\"\n\nShe said her Christian colleagues would take extra care to usher her inside the church out of view of the white supremacists and neo-Nazis just across the street and in the park.\n\n\"To be at the church knowing that my husband was at the shul was very terrifying,\" Rachel Schmelkin said. \"I was very relieved to see him when he showed up at the church after services and all was OK.\"\n\n2:30 p.m.: the hospital The Schmelkins left the church to rush an injured woman to the hospital. They returned to the church briefly before going home, worried that police could block off the downtown area and restrict their access to their home if protests became too violent.\n\nLater that evening, the rabbis cancelled the havdalah service, consisting of a braided candle, wine, spices and song, that marks the end of Shabbat, citing safety concerns.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nRabbi Emeritus Daniel Alexander wasn't in town that Shabbat and instead returned to the community on Sunday. He said Charlottesville, thanks to the University of Virginia, is a progressive town that's been home to prominent Jewish families since the 19th century.\n\nHe said the protests on Saturday felt like an invasion.\n\n\"Charlottesville (has) now become a buzzword with associations that are not really characteristic of the place,\" Alexander said to the Forward. \"It feels like a violation that doesn't feel good right now. In a certain way it's a kind of a loss.\"\n\nFor Gutherz, the senior rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel, the violence and bigotry of the day do not characterize Charlottesville. He said the community needs to take time to process the weekend to figure out how to best move forward.\n\n\"The community was turning to the faith community for leadership, and we tried to provide it as best we could,\" Gutherz said. \"The war on hate is also a spiritual war ... and we need to stand by our principles of love and acceptance and justice.\"\n\nContact Erica Snow at snow@forward.com", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100, "id": 1181, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}, "type": "loc", "id": "102"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "200134"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302813", "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302906", "label": {"eng": "Wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303332", "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synagogue", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303449", "label": {"eng": "Synagogue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304283", "label": {"eng": "Christian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304554", "label": {"eng": "Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Methodist_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304913", "label": {"eng": "United Methodist Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305262", "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305969", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_prayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "307985", "label": {"eng": "Jewish prayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310713", "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "312441", "label": {"eng": "Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314991", "label": {"eng": "Reform Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "314995", "label": {"eng": "Shabbat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "314998", "label": {"eng": "Rabbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "315669", "label": {"eng": "Pogrom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "337392", "label": {"eng": "University of Virginia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "341009", "label": {"eng": "Torah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzword", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "343999", "label": {"eng": "Buzzword"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havdalah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "410724", "label": {"eng": "Havdalah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kippah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "429575", "label": {"eng": "Kippah"}}]}

He was flanked by his two assistants dressed as he was, in colorful caps and robes adorned with Jewish symbols. Together, they angrily denounced Caucasians -- with particular malice for \"so-called Jews.\" Occasionally, the main man would nudge one of his helpers who had missed a cue to read from the Bible in his hand. The addled assistant, once (or several times) so reminded, would then find the place in his own book and, pointing at it, read a pre-designated verse, stiltedly but with great enthusiasm.\n\nDisplayed nearby was a large board inscribed with the names of the \"twelve tribes of Israel.\" Opposite each was a novel identification: one of twelve African or Caribbean nationalities. Their citizens, the MC shouted, were the \"real Jews.\"\n\nMy immediate reaction was amusement. But then I thought about how tragic it was that beings created b'tzelem Elokim, capable of meaningful accomplishments, imagine themselves worthy of dignity only by belittling others, even stooping to adopt an identity not their own.\n\nNo point, I knew, in engaging the pitiable prophets in conversation. Their beliefs were fueled by fantasy, not fact. But I indulged in a little fantasizing myself, imagining what I would tell them if only I might find some crack in the wall of their whimsy.\n\nI would share with them a secret: Klal Yisrael's chosenness isn't a trophy, a bed of laurels on which to rest. In the Jewish view of things, I'd explain, being chosen is less a badge than a charge. Yes, we Jews indeed consider our forebears' merits as extending throughout the generations to encompass their descendants. But the bottom line is that being chosen is an obligation.\n\nWhat's more, I would tell them, our special status -- unlike the supremacy preached by racists of whatever hue -- is available to anyone, of any race, who both recognizes that fact and is sincerely willing to join the Jewish people and undertake its mission. One can, in other words, choose to be chosen.\n\nBut admission to the Jewish People requires sincerity and commitment, not placards and loudspeakers. It's easy to strut about with skullcaps and shout, but undertaking the endeavor of Judaism -- humbly assuming the holy yoke of the Torah's commandments and Jewish observance -- is in a different realm entirely.\n\nThen, though, something else dawned.

Sabeel was founded in 1989 by an Anglican priest, Naim Ateek, former Canon of St. George's Cathedral in Jerusalem. Still based in Jerusalem, it has eleven chapters in Western countries. In Ateek's theology, Jesus is no longer a Jew living under Roman rule, but \"a Palestinian living under an occupation.\" Ateek has spoken without irony while preaching that\n\n\"it seems to many of us that Jesus is on the cross again with thousands of crucified Palestinians around him. It only takes people of insight to see the hundreds of thousands of crosses throughout the land, Palestinian men, women, and children being crucified. Palestine has become one huge Golgotha. The Israeli government crucifixion system is operating daily. Palestine has become the place of the skull.\"\n\nHere, he is drawing on the familiar canard of Jews as Christ-killers, a trope rejected by most mainstream Christian churches. The concept has, as we know, been the basis for all earlier Christian persecution and murder of Jews.\n\nSabeel's theology distorts the Old Testament by denying Jews any ongoing connection with the land of their origin, and treating them as a people abandoned by God. There is also repeated disparagement of Judaism as \"tribal,\" \"primitive,\" and \"exclusionary.\" Judaism has also been unjustly described as a \"theology of contempt\".[1]\n\nWhere most modern churches have left the anti-Semitism of the past behind and recognize that the Romans, not the Jews, crucified Jesus, the exponents of this cult of what has been called \"Christian Palestinianism\" deny any historical or theological connection between the biblical Israel, the Jewish people, and the modern State of Israel. In doing this in a period that has seen a massive upsurge in anti-Semitism throughout Europe, North America, and the Islamic world, Sabeel openly states that history's most persecuted community, the Jews, has no right whatsoever to a land in which it can defend itself from assaults and the current open threat, this time from Iran, of another genocide. Sabeel seems to have turned its back on all the work done by organizations such as the Council of Christians and Jews, the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, or the World Congress of Faiths. (For a list of other statements by Ateek, see here.)\n\nSabeel has been widely criticized by both Christians and Jews. Anglican Friends of Israel has listed several Christian critics. Dexter Van Zile from the United Church of Christ is convinced that Ateek is dangerous:\n\n\"He's able to wrap up Palestinian nationalism in the language of Christian Witness and essentially that agenda then gets legitimized by Churches in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Australia. He gives legitimacy to a dishonest historical narrative.\"\n\nSister Ruth Laut, a lawyer and Dominican nun, of Churches United for Just Peace in the Middle East and Rev. William Harter of Presbyterians Concerned for Jewish Relations and the National Christian Leadership Conference for Israel, have spoken against the Sabeel's agenda.\n\nCharles McVety, the president of Canada Christian College and an evangelical Christian leader, has said that\n\n\"These groups do not speak on behalf of Christians in any way. They are a radical fringe indulging their anti-Semitic, anti-Israel bias under the guise of neutrality.\"\n\nNor are these individuals alone. Anglican Friends of Israel reported in 2005:\n\n\"Deeply concerned about the programs and message that Sabeel is bringing to North America, a body called The Coalition for Responsible Peace in the Middle East has been formed. It includes the United Church of Christ. The Coalition has stated that \"They (Sabeel) undermine hopes for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, for greater understanding about the conflict and for the spread of religious tolerance.\"\n\nThe journalist Jeff Jacoby has stated that \"Sabeel and Ateek's denunciations of Israel have included imagery explicitly linking the modern Jewish state to the terrible charge that for centuries fueled so much anti-Jewish hatred and bloodshed,\" and that \"In Ateek's metaphorical telling, in other words, Israel is guilty of trying to murder Jesus as an infant, of killing Jesus on the cross, and of seeking to prevent his resurrection.\"\n\nJacoby quotes Adam Gregerman, Assistant Director of the Institute for Jewish-Christian Relations at Saint Joseph's University (a Jesuit institution in Philadelphia). Writing in the Journal of Ecumenical Studies in 2004, Gregerman observed that \"liberation theologians\" such as Ateek \"perpetuate some of the most unsavory and vicious images of the Jews as malevolent, antisocial, hostile to non-Jews. ... As such, liberation theology impedes rather than fosters any serious attempt at understanding or ending the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians.\"\n\nIn the UK, the leading representative of Sabeel is the notorious Rev. Dr. Stephen Sizer, the incumbent of the Anglican parish of Christchurch, Virginia Water, in Surrey. I say \"notorious\" because of the trouble he has brought on himself within the church. On January 20, 2015, Sizer posted a link on his Facebook page to a lengthy 9/11 conspiracy theory article entitled \"9/11 Israel did it.\" The article included claims which, among others, seek to connect wealthy American Jews to the attacks, through their ownership of buildings, political affiliations or links to Israel. Sizer asked: \"Is this anti-Semitic? If so no doubt I'll be asked to remove it. It raises so many questions.\"\n\nLater, he removed the post, not necessarily because he no longer thought it was true, but because Britain's leading Jewish organization, the Board of Deputies of British Jews, had asked for it to be taken down. In correspondence with Jewish News Online, he asked that evidence be provided to refute the conspiracy theory.\n\nOn January 29, 2015, the Church of England stated that the comments made by Sizer were unacceptable and that the Diocese of Guildford would launch an investigation. The following day, Sizer issued a statement of apology and announced that the diocese had suspended him from all social media and blogs. The Board of Deputies of British Jews also published a statement condemning Sizer's behavior. On February 9, it emerged that he had been banned from social media by the new Bishop of Guildford, the Rt. Revd. Andrew Watson, for at least six months, for his allegation of Israeli responsibility for the 9/11 atrocities. Sizer has also been banned from commenting on issues relating to the Middle East and will not attend further conferences on this subject. In his letter to the bishop, Sizer accepted that if he were to break the undertaking he has made not to use social media for that period, he would have to resign his ministry.\n\nThe Bishop of Manchester, Nigel McCulloch, who chairs the Council of Christians and Jews, has said that\n\n\"The content and the delay in removing the link from Mr Sizer's Facebook page was disgraceful and unbecoming for a clergyman of the Church of England to promote. Members of the CCJ have described the website as 'obscenely antisemitic.'\"\n\nSimon McIlwaine, known as a man of integrity, is the founder of Anglican Friends of Israel. He has called for Sizer to be defrocked.\n\nWe have to ask why, in the light of what we know of Sabeel, Naim Ateek and Stephen Sizer, an Anglican church in Newcastle chose to display and distribute literature from this organization, containing quotations from Ateek. This is not a light matter. It raises profound questions. Perhaps the gravest error made by Kairos, Sabeel, and other Christian groups who pursue a one-sided campaign is that they take away from the Palestinians any form of agency or self-reliance. If the Israelis are to blame for all that is wrong and the Palestinians are only victims, then Palestinians must be treated as children, without the will and power to act on their own behalf. Or who can act only through violence and hate.\n\nThis infantilization of a people who have taken thousands of innocent lives, committed grave sins, and openly rejected offers of peace makes them, instead, passive recipients of suffering rather than the actors that, in fact, they are. By disengaging Palestinians from responsibility for their own hatred and actions, anti-Israel churchmen and lay members trap the very people for whom they evince the greatest love inside thoughts and policies, many of them inspired by Islamic teachings, that call for the oppression of Jews and Christians as dhimmi peoples (tolerated, second-class citizens) that render them more powerless. They permit the Palestinians to persist within an atmosphere of hatred, rather than calling them to love. There is no place, in our opinion, for the support of hatred within a Christian church, just as no hatred is ever expressed within a synagogue.\n\nOr, as many people increasingly suspect, are these campaigns, replete with fraudulent charges, as in the Inquisition, really not about Palestinians at all, but just the latest incarnation of the old racist and religious hatred of Jews, and a clear expression of the \"New Anti-Semitism\"?\n\nIn conclusion, let us present the Shalom Declaration, a statement that has been presented to Christians of many denominations and signed by them as a token of their trust of Israel and the Jewish people. It speaks for itself.\n\nThe Shalom Declaration:\n\nWe deeply appreciate that Israel is the only country in the Middle East which extends freedom of worship to all its citizens and where the Christian community is growing. We grieve and stand with families in Israel and the wider Middle East, who have lost loved ones and with all who are persecuted by the rise of violent extremism and intolerance in the region. We pray that those inciting trouble and disharmony in the Middle East and who threaten the existence of Israel will be thwarted. We further pray that the peacemakers will see their patience and vision rewarded so that Isaiah's prophecy of \"swords beaten into pruning forks\" and the declaration of Jesus that \"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called the sons of God,\" will soon become a reality. We draw succour from the vibrancy of the State of Israel, from its democratic political system, its academic and cultural creativity and its remarkable contribution to humanity in terms of science and technology. And we call upon the spiritual leaders and elected representatives of our nation to work tirelessly to combat anti-Semitism and violent extremism across the world and to strengthen understanding and co-operation between the peoples of our nation and of Israel.\n\nWe call upon the Anglican Church to consider this report and to examine the Wall Will Fall event and the false claims of Kairos, Sabeel and like organizations in the light of Christ's message of love and forgiveness. It must be the Church's judgement whether there is need for a call to repentance. But if there is no coming alive to the injustice and deceit of Christian anti-Semitism and anti-Israelism, then this ungodly bigotry and confusion within the churches will continue to fester.\n\nUnfortunately, the structure of the workshops at the \"Walls Will Fall\" event, held in St Thomas The Martyr Church in Newcastle upon Tyne, meant that one could only attend two out of the four available workshops and not the film.\n\nThe first workshop was on \"Palestinian-Israeli collaboration,\" and focused on the Villages Group, an NGO involving some Israelis with rural Palestinians in two villages near Nablus. This project seems in many ways commendable, and I can understand why some Christians support it. But the group's own website and Facebook page are avowedly anti-Israeli, taking on causes for the Palestinian side only. This became clear during the workshop, which condemned Israeli security checkpoints, the Israeli security barrier, and related topics. Although I had not intended to say anything during the day, these accusations grew so vicious that it felt necessary to address some of the points made.\n\nAn attempt was made to explain that the \"Wall\" is only a tiny fraction of the Israeli security barrier, well over 90% of which is a wire fence some 430 miles in length. There is no doubt that the barrier and checkpoints make life difficult for the Palestinians, but in the workshop I pointed out that it was built in response to the huge toll in lives taken by suicide bombers and other terrorists; since its construction many hundreds of lives have been saved, as illustrated in the chart below:\n\nTwo other matters seemed relevant. When there were checkpoints during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, most people (including the present writer and his family) were grateful for their presence to prevent terrorist attacks. Then, back in the Middle East, we meet a Gazan woman, Wafa Samir Ibrahim al-Biss, who was arrested at a checkpoint on June 20, 2005, while wearing a massive bomb strapped to her thigh. She planned to go as an outpatient to the Soroka Medical Center in Beersheva, Israel, where her life had been saved after she suffered burns in a domestic accident. Her orders, given by Fatah's al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, were to explode the bomb among the doctors and nurses, killing as many children as possible. At that time, Palestinians trying to smuggle bombs and other weapons through checkpoints were arrested almost every day.\n\nThe only response to this information was a statement that \"this is all nonsense\" or words to that effect. Given the Christian context of the workshop, one could only be at a loss to understand such a very clear indifference to the concept of saving human life. No-one present (in a packed room) voiced any objection to that callous remark.\n\nLiterature\n\nThere is no space here for a full discussion of the many leaflets, pamphlets and booklets that were made available on the dozen or more bookstalls at the event. With a couple of exceptions (such as information on some girls' schools in the West Bank), none of the material contained even a brief mention of the Jewish, moderate Christian, or Israeli side of events and policies. Much seemed heavily and sometimes viciously expressive of hatred for the State of Israel; placed one hundred percent of the blame for any conflict on Israel or Jewish settlers. Much also discounted, excused, covered up or ignored decades of Arab and Palestinian violence and PLO and Hamas calls for the eradication of Israel because it is a Jewish state and therefore unacceptable in Islamic law. Some of what was there was gross, much of it was subtle. For anyone with a limited knowledge of the history and ideological underpinnings of this dispute, the glosses and mis-statements were persuasive and, unsurprisingly, designed to draw readers into the Palestinian narrative.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri":

It grew out of a series of trips they arranged for international authors with Breaking the Silence, an organization of Israeli soldiers who have served in the West Bank and now speak out against the machinery of occupation they participated in there. The essays in this collection are supposed to reflect upon the authors' travels with a kind of moral clarity and humanistic appeal that the editors ascribe especially to fiction writers.\n\nWhen The Forward interviewed Michael Chabon after one of these trips, the magazine asked him: Why this book? Why these writers? Chabon explained that as \"professional noticers,\" fiction writers have a special role in instigating the destruction of cruel institutions. He invoked the standard-bearer of the American 19th-century social problem novel:\n\nWithout Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel Uncle Tom's Cabin, there might not have been a Civil War fought to end slavery in the United States. It was a novel, more than anything else, more than preaching from the pulpits or the reports of travelers or whatever the equivalent of journalism would have been in that day, or first-person slave narratives.\n\nUncle Tom's Cabin is a strange point of reference for the collection. Stowe's novel did not do \"more than anything else\" to precipitate the Civil War or end slavery. And more to the point, it was a novel. It was in no way a documentary account of slavery, in the way that Kingdom of Olives and Ash is meant to be about the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. Does Chabon mean that novelists qua novelists have a special way of seeing that is unavailable to anyone else, and therefore even their essays will have the power to melt swords into ploughshares?\n\nChabon and Waldman told the Guardian they wanted to present writing about the occupation that is \"free of cant,\" to \"bring to life the situation [...] through human narrative.\" What's missing from the news, they suggest, is the human, which novelists alone can provide from their universalist positions. The assumptions undergirding the collection are bizarre: first, that there's a paucity of literature about Palestine, a region filled with literary writers and readers, insufficiently but increasingly translated into English; second, that a bunch of mostly new-to-the-question internationals are the people to fill that gap; and third, that the political problem of Palestine is one of failure of information, an \"if only people knew\" approach that is insultingly na\u00efve about the interests at work in maintaining a theocratic ethnocracy.\n\n\u00a4\n\nThe book comes after its editors have become increasingly public critics of the Israeli military occupation, which marks 50 years this summer. In January, they wrote an op-ed for The New York Times called \"Who's Afraid of Nonviolence?\" In it, they excoriate a security state that persecutes, arrests, and imprisons nonviolent resistors like Issa Amro, the coordinator of Youth Against Settlements who is currently facing politically motivated charges in Israeli military court.\n\nChabon and Waldman argue that Amro represents a bulwark against violent resistance. In what's ostensibly a critique of Israel's criminalization of resistance, they repeat a concern for Israel's safety: \"In binding the upraised fist of resistance, they will leave only the hand that is holding the knife.\" By focusing on the danger Israel's actions pose to its own status, they may be trying to be strategically palatable to a US audience. But they squander an opportunity to decenter Israel's welfare as Americans' primary concern, and they reify the distinction between \"Israel\" and \"the occupation,\" as if the state could be a good and ethical actor while continuing in its 69-year programs of segregation and apartheid.\n\nIn its pride in its non-expertise, the collection provides a kind of pressure valve for a liberal Zionism increasingly in crisis: it is possible to care deeply about Palestinian freedom without rejecting the concept of the Jewish state. The problem is always 1967, and to speak of 1948 is to veer into anti-Semitism. But liberal Zionism -- in its ideology and its institutions -- is not merely insufficiently critical; it bolsters and empowers and constitutes state racism, giving it a humanistic logic and a progressive alibi. This ideology has always been in crisis, because its logic has always been internally contradictory. And over the past 20 years the post-Oslo settlement boom, the Second Intifada, and the constant and escalating siege of Gaza have begun to confound defenses of liberal Zionism, a tension you can see pulling at the edges of Chabon and Waldman's self-contradictory editorial claims.\n\nIn some ways, the content of the collection exceeds its editors' liberal Zionist field of vision; in some ways, it can't. There are a few Palestinian writers with essays in the collection. There are also a few Jewish Israelis, and mostly there are writers with no connection to or history in Palestine. The table of contents demonstrates a bland pluralist logic of bringing together important writers without regard for their commitments and knowledge. The essays themselves vary widely in their scope and resonance -- a few are stunning, formally experimental, incisive; others seem dashed-off and full of platitudes. Expert witnesses on the occupation make sharper connections than the novices do, and set out different basic premises -- for example, when Fida Jiryis pushes back at the fiction of the Green Line as the barrier between a proper state and a rogue occupation: \"As Palestinians -- on whichever side of the Green Line we live -- we spend every minute of our lives in the country paying for the fact that we are not Jewish.\"\n\nAs a propagandist, Chabon apologizes for Israel even when he's critiquing it. But in 2007, he wrote a novel in which an alternate history has unfolded that sheds a glaring light on the actual present. Exploring what Michael Andre Bernstein calls the \"sideshadows\" of the 20th century, Chabon constructs an alternate reality from which an immanent critique of Zionism emerges -- satirical, irreverent, and animated by love.\n\n\u00a4\n\nTen years ago, Chabon published The Yiddish Policemen's Union, a noir homage that's also a classic American Western and at the same time a heart-wrenching borscht-belt Jewish screwball comedy. Like Philip K. Dick's The Man in the High Castle and Philip Roth's The Plot Against America, The Yiddish Policemen's Union imagines a different turn of events in a United States reckoning with fascism. In Chabon's alternate history, an atomic bomb was dropped on Germany in 1946, Israel failed in 1948, and two million Jews live on borrowed time in a borrowed polity in Sitka, Alaska. Now the mandate is running out, and they must figure out where to go.\n\nIn the intervening years, a Jewish-Alaskan culture has developed, with a contemporary Yiddish slang. An Alaskan-Jewish politics has also grown up: shady, criminal, kind of nihilistic, violent but not militarized. Now Detective Meyer Landsman, a depressed, vulnerable reincarnation of Sam Spade, reflects on the history and future of the Jews of Sitka as he works his last case under the direction of his ex-wife, Bina.\n\nThe Yiddish Policemen's Union is a murder mystery: the anonymous body Landsman finds in his own hotel turns out to be Mendel Shpilman, a scion of a Chasidic family who was once widely thought to be the Messiah. Over the course of the novel, Landsman traces Mendel's movements from the fictional Verbover sect to the secular world: Mendel was raised as a beloved prodigy, a brilliant Talmudic mind, and a preternaturally empathic child. He left the Verbover fold and lived anonymously in the secular world until, as Landsman discovers, he was briefly recruited back to serve as the figurehead for a Verbover plan for the end of the Jewish mandate in Sitka.\n\nIn partnership with American government operatives and their local Jewish gangster COINTELPRO-running proxies, along with generous Jewish donors from Westchester County and Boca Raton, the Verbover Chasids were running a messianic operation that required a carefully bred red heifer for verisimilitude and the redeemed Messiah of Sitka to draw the pious together. They would (and eventually do) bomb the Dome of the Rock, and under cover of global and local panic, secure borders for the new state of Israel and airlift all the Verbover Chasidim into it. Mendel was important to them for their handmade iteration of messianic time. When he refused, they killed him.\n\nFor the most part, the alternate history of The Yiddish Policemen's Union is smoothly rendered background, discernible but not distracting, like Marilyn Monroe Kennedy's pink pillbox hat. This early accounting is one of a few moments in which that alternate history is laid out explicitly:\n\nNineteen forty-eight: Strange times to be a Jew. In August the defense of Jerusalem collapsed and the outnumbered Jews of the three-month-old republic of Israel were routed, massacred, and driven into the sea. As Hertz was starting his job at Foehn Harmattan & Buran, the House Committee on Territories and Insular Affairs began a long-delayed review of status called for by the Sitka Settlement Act. Like the rest of Congress, like most Americans, the House Committee was sobered by grim revelations of the slaughter of two million Jews in Europe, by the barbarity of the rout of Zionism, by the plight of the refugees of Palestine and Europe.\n\nChabon's rout of 1948 is a perfect Zionist fantasy. In this made-up failure of Zionism, the idea of endangerment upon which it partially depends is reinforced. All those times when the Arabs tried to push the Jews into the sea, or secretly wanted to push the Jews into the sea, or were heroically prevented from pushing the Jews into the sea, are retroactively redeemed from the territory of paranoia. Because, look: The very first time, the Jews really were pushed into the sea. This is the barbarism Israel counts on as its constitutive outside when it calls itself the only democracy in the Middle East. And now the foundational refugee crisis of Israel is not the expulsion of at least 800,000 Palestinian Arabs, but the exile and murder, yet again, of millions of Jews.\n\nThis bit of pseudo-historiography comes very early in the novel. At this point, neither Landsman nor the reader know about the attempt on Jerusalem being planned by the Americans and the Verbover Chasids. Later, this story of Jewish weakness will look different, as it becomes the prologue to a Jewish militarism and territorialism Landsman finds appalling. At this point, however, all of Zionism's fears and fantasies are validated -- constant persecution, barbaric Arabs, the danger of annihilation.\n\nJewish Sitka works as both analogue and critique of the state of Israel -- it's an echo, a mockery, an homage, and a rejection. Like Israel, Sitka is a solution for the Jewish refugee crisis in which the Allies defer the Jewish problem to their unproductive colonial outposts -- in this case Alaska rather than Palestine. Like Israel, its founding mythos is nostalgically remembered as revolutionary and socialist, \"young Jewesses in their blue headscarves singing Negro spirituals with Yiddish lyrics that paraphrased Lincoln and Marx.\"\n\nSitka's frontiers are characterized by violent clashes between land-crazy religious Jews and indigenous people whose land they're settling. As with Israel, the violent clashes at the frontier serve as the moral horizon of the political mainstream. Like West Bank settlers and Gaza settlers before them, they represent the political fringe that can be rejected by the political center in order to shore up the overall settlement project -- Sitka, Israel -- as reasonable, as politically modern and rational, mirroring the greater project's racial exclusions while serving as an alibi for its supposed excesses. In The Yiddish Policemen's Union, the most stark settler violence is engineered and manipulated by Landsman's COINTELPRO-running uncle Hertz. Here settlement at the frontier is revealed to be not a sad marginal breach of the state-building project but an extension of its internal logics of power and precarity (one of the starkest and most interesting contradictions to Chabon's public speaking and writing about Kingdom, in which the 1967 occupation is a singular atrocity, separable from the state as a whole).\n\nIn constructing a new old-new Jewish homeland, Chabon mocks the arbitrary sentiment of the Zionist mythos with diasporic irritability. Jewish settlers are \"polar bears\" rather than \"sabras\" (for the native cactus); as in Israel and elsewhere, settler claims for indigenous status are articulated through human analogy to the landscape, people turned into natural objects. The Polar Bears, like the Zionist pioneers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, drained the swamps and made an ugly, unproductive land productive. Both are lands manifestly \"without a people\" (a Zionist slogan that traces its roots to 19th-century Christian restorationism) because the indigenous people there are not making the land productive in a way that is legible to capitalism.\n\nSitka isn't a simple one-to-one analogue with Israel, for all its resonances. It's its own settler story, of course -- based on an actual Harold Ickes proposal. With its random iconography (polar bear pajamas!), it also emerges as a series of silent wry reminders of Uganda, Cyprus, the short-lived Argentina project -- Jewish settlement ideas that are in retrospect as silly as this Sitka plan. Israel becomes, by implication, as absurd and random an undertaking, as little a fulfillment of history. The modern state of Israel as the telos toward which millennia of wandering have led becomes a joke. That wandering could have led to Uganda, or Argentina, or Alaska; and wherever it had led, stories would have emerged to cast it as the promised land, now redeemed.\n\nAccording to \"Nokh Amol,\" a song that Landsman and every other Alaskan Jew of his generation learned in grade school, the smell of the wind from the Gulf fills a Jewish nose with a sense of promise, opportunity, the chance to start again. \"Nokh Amol\" dates from the Polar Bear days, the early forties, and it's supposed to be an expression of gratitude for another miraculous deliverance: Once Again. Nowadays the Jews of the Sitka District tend to hear the ironic edge that was there all along.\n\nThis reframing of European Jewish migrations underscores the particularity and contingency of the contemporary Zionist narrative of Jewish exile from Europe and redemption in Palestine. In the process, the familiar post-Nazi Holocaust motto \"Never Again\" becomes \"Once Again,\" and Jewish history is renarrated as a series of miraculous recoveries rather than a series of persecutions. Everything that Zionism claims as its self-evident foreshadowing, the things that made it inevitable, are rendered here as particular and full of other possible shadows.\n\n\u00a4\n\nSitka is an outpost of US imperialism and settler colonialism. A collection of problematic Jews is given an empty bundle of land the US government hasn't decided what else to do with yet, at the margins of which it fights with and steals from the Tlingit Indians who were patently already there. It's an awkwardly timed iteration of the US frontier, in which Jewish settlers wrangle for land in pre-state (or non-state) Alaska.\n\nIn the 2009 article \"Jews Among the Indians,\" Sarah Phillips Casteel identifies a trend in Jewish North American literature in which Jews claim a place in the nation through both conquest of indigenous people and becoming indigenous, inserting themselves into both the pre-colonial history and the settler-colonial project of the state. In Casteel's reading of The Yiddish Policemen's Union, this awkward doubled Jewish position never resolves into a sense of belonging. As both refugees and settlers, Jews are always awkwardly positioned in Sitka, in relation to Indians, to Jews elsewhere, to the landscape and the weather and the future. Whether or not these particular Jews understand Jewish statehood as an impossible contradiction, they are surrounded by its destructive and destroyed effects.\n\nOn the one hand, The Yiddish Policemen's Union is a novel about conquest on the US frontier; on the other, it's a thought experiment about political Zionism in both Sitka and Palestine. Chabon brings together these two stories of conquest not just as analogy but as interlocked processes. The training camp for the Verbover Militia is on a small island off of Sitka that is not part of the mandate, that the conspirators control through a combination of force and a bargain with local Tlingit law enforcement. From the moment Landsman tracks Mendel Shpilman's late movements to a training camp on Baranof Island, called hilariously the Beth Tikkun Retreat Center, the tableau of joint American-Zionist-Jewish expansion plays out like a farce of itself.\n\nOnce Landsman arrives on Baranof Island, the bomb plot is revealed as a confluence of Jewish and Christian religious fundamentalism, supported by the US government in the person of a Mr. Cashdollar and by the wealthy American Jewish benefactors to whom plaques are dedicated around the training camp. Zionism and its fictional analogues are revealed as a settler-colonial project enmeshed both metaphorically and logistically in US settler-colonialism. They don't merely resemble or illuminate or mirror each other; they constitute each other. (Sometimes in obscenely literal ways.) Landsman turns away from them both and toward only a kind of stateless, diasporic homemaking through kinship.\n\nAt the beginning of The Yiddish Policemen's Union, Zionism looks like a light unto nations that dimmed in 1948, a muscular Judaism that never arrived -- which if revived could signal the possibility of a Jewish future. It could address both the ancient frail brainy weakness of the Jews and the lawless, wild hatred of their enemies. And yet, Chabon's Detective Landsman finds the new, hearty, militarized Jews of the Beth Tikkun Retreat Center terrifying and the national belonging they're planning useless. Chabon holds up the rationale of Zionism at the very beginning of the novel, and by the end it has been emptied out:\n\nBut there is no Messiah of Sitka. Landsman has no home, no future, no fate but Bina. The land that he and she were promised was bounded only by the fringes of their wedding canopy, by the dog-eared corners of their cards of membership in an international fraternity whose members carry their patrimony in a tote bag, their world on the tip of their tongue.\n\nIn turning away with Bina, Landsman throws in his lot with a kind of home-making absent the state and absent a territory. If his home is in her tote bag, they are wanderers, tied together by the bonds of kinship. It's the marriage plot so farcically realized, so satirical about itself, as to round the horn of capital and succession to become tender again. It does not require having children. Throughout the novel, Landsman regrets pushing Bina to have an abortion when they discovered their fetus had a mosaic chromosomal anomaly: there is another trail of possibility that peters out. Not a claim to the future landscape of time or the current landscape of space, no claim but to one another.\n\n\u00a4\n\nFor centuries, the \"Jewish question\" in Europe was answered with violence and exclusion. Political Zionism developed as a solution both to the problem of Jewish oppression and to the problem Jews posed to the liberal project of the European nation-state: Theodor Herzl's 19th-century proposal would remove Europe's Jews and enable the liberal nation-state to thrive twice, in a purified Europe and a conquered Palestine. As in Uncle Tom's Cabin, what's purportedly an argument for liberation of racialized people from the white state is also an argument for ethnic cleansing as a solution to the difficulties posed to white supremacy by racial difference (as in Liberia and Palestine). There's an echo of this collaboration in The Yiddish Policemen's Union, as the alliance between the Americans and the Verbover Chasidim requires each to think the others are stooges: the Americans are a tool for Verbover conquest, and the Verbovers will gather the Jews in so the Second Coming can redeem the American Christian fundamentalists. Landsman refuses to be either the redeemed or the redeemer in this machination.\n\nIn The Yiddish Policemen's Union, all the problems -- of Zionism, of settlement, of belonging -- are Jewish problems. All the questions are Jewish questions. The critique of Zionism that emerges here is generally that the Jewish state is a bad idea for the Jews. It makes Jews mean, scrapes away their distinctive Jewish markings, makes them do the evil and violent things usually left to people like the novel's unscrupulous Americans. The Zionist idea gets Jews into dumb, vicious land wars.\n\nThe near-absence of Palestinians from the story of Zionism in The Yiddish Policemen's Union seems to make it a Jewish folly, with a Jewish cost only. Zionism is a solution to the Jewish problem, and its effects are special, private Jewish problems. In this way, the novel's Jewish world reflects the discourses of danger and isolation that characterize mainstream talk about Zionism in the United States. Palestinians are either barbarians or nonexistent. Criticism of Israel is the new new new anti-Semitism, and may be legislated against.\n\nAs much as the novel illuminates the question of Zion, of settlement, of American and Jewish race and belonging, it's limited in sympathy and scope. This limitation is an echo of particularly American discursive limitations around Israel, as something only Jews can speak about fairly, something that is most difficult and wrenching for Jews to reckon with. This is where both Chabon's New York Times and Forward persona and his novel's critique stop short.\n\nIn interviews and press materials for Kingdom, Chabon's argument for what the novelist can do is unconvincing, cut off by some of the same limits of the human and the grievable as the sentimental novel, by its papercuts and shadow puppets. But what he actually does in his novel surpasses his own argument about fiction and justice. Chabon hasn't written a social problem novel: The Yiddish Policemen's Union is an entirely different beast. To the extent that Chabon claims the territory of the social problem novel for Kingdom, he illuminates the genre's limitations and its participation in the fictions necessary for the liberal defense of state racism. It is precisely The Yiddish Policemen's Union's departure that lets it do and imagine something stranger. The social problem novel can only represent the world in the terms with which it thinks about the world: pure and impure, purifiable. But an alternate history requires world building, and a theory of world building. This allows for the possibility of a critique of Zionism that doesn't take as a given ethnocracy or theocracy or the state as a route to liberation.\n\nI don't believe it matters very much whether liberal Zionists change their minds about Palestine. I don't come down in favor of the kind of saving of souls on offer in Harriet Beecher Stowe or in the Kingdom editors' interviews. Anyone paying attention -- even anyone who's told they're welcome there -- should know better, by now, than to think that democracy and ethnocracy are commensurate. But we could do with investigations into non-state-based liberation politics, into a Jewish timeline that doesn't feature a triumphant, triumphalist return on the investments of European racism.\n\nChabon and Waldman's argument for what fiction writers can do is reductive and dull. But Chabon's novel enacts a dissent from settlement and conquest that would be impossible for Kingdom -- different in kind and different in its investments. Here, the counterfactual novel offers more strange and interesting methods for thinking about Palestine than this ostensibly progressive political undertaking. Alternate history paradoxically contains both the seeds of dissent -- everything might have gone differently -- and a reactionary clinging to history's inevitable progress to this point. In The Yiddish Policemen's Union, the combined despair and inventiveness of this paradox are especially potent: the result of this contradiction in the life of Detective Meyer Landsman is that the question of settlement becomes self-evidently moot, and blows itself up.\n\n\u00a4", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentine

It has existed as an idea within the ranks of the KKK since its early days and continues today in various corners of the political spectrum. It's what happens when both Jews and Israelis are not viewed as human beings but political abstractions whose very existence is socially unacceptable and deserving of contempt. To counter such thinking, we have to not only be vocal in counter-protests but make sure that Zionism does not become socially taboo in our political and social discourses. To allow this is to be an enabler of the vile acts we witnessed this weekend. More importantly, when we talk about Israelis -- as with any human being -- our conversations must capture the fullness of their humanity; and to be human is to be at times vulnerable and insecure; imperfect and yet full of aspirations, ambitions, and the idiosyncrasies that make us the impossible, interesting creatures that we all are -- worthy of redemption.\n\nThe other day I was doing some close reading of Yossi Klein Halevi's Memoirs of a Jewish Extremist. My job is to create spaces where deep Israel engagement through a greater understanding of Zionism as a philosophy can be cultivated. In my lectures, I aim for my audiences to understand Zionism within the greater context of the human condition, not just as a political movement. So I thought it'd be interesting to draw lessons from a great writer and see what he had to teach me about the human experience through the lens of his own.\n\nHalevi's autobiography reads like a Hollywood movie script and has insightful things to say about the effects of bigotry and trauma on a community that are often overlooked. In everyday society we understand bigotry as a force that has animated dangerous political movements throughout history and which threaten to do so again. Yet this is an academic description -- not an explanation. Bigotry is what happens when one person (or people) begin to see another as inhuman.\n\nThis has been a regular theme of anti-Semitism. For example, Halevi writes about how the genocidal impulses of Nazi Germany required that the Nazis see the Jews as soulless as that would be the only justification of a genocide. \"It wasn't enough to destroy the Jews\", he writes. \"First they had to be degraded, transformed into living exhibits of the absence of soul.\" Halevi went further to say that Jews \"were being transformed into freaks -- ghettoized and demonized.\"\n\nIt's been a month since I've studied this book together but I bring it up in light of recent events in Charlotsville where Neo-Nazis draped in Confederate flags attempted once more to depict Jews as soulless.\n\n\"\"The truth is,\" Klans member David Duke told a large crowd on Saturday, \"the American media, and the American political system, and the American Federal Reserve, is dominated by a tiny minority: the Jewish Zionist cause.\"\n\nMost in polite society condemned these Neo-Nazi demonstrations. But it's worth pointing out and then pointing out again that anti-Semitism occurs when groups seek to dehumanize Jews -- and, yes, by Jews, I do mean Zionists.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100, "id": 276, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Liberalism", "wgt": 100, "id": 492, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Liberalism"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "wgt": 100, "id": 705, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/News_and_Media", "wgt": 100, "id": 788, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/News and Media"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100, "id": 885, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100, "id": 1181, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}, "type": "loc", "id": "102"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302814", "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302854", "label": {"eng": "Human"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302948", "label": {"eng": "Politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303257", "label": {"eng": "Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303325", "label": {"eng": "Culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303747", "label": {"eng": "History"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304273", "label": {"eng": "Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304451", "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304554", "label": {"eng": "Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "305262", "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "305926", "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "type": "loc", "id": "308374"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigotry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310173", "label": {"eng": "Bigotry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310713", "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314403", "label": {"eng": "Political spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "315665", "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "315670", "label": {"eng": "Israelis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "317636", "label": {"eng": "Taboo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "318256", "label": {"eng": "Ku Klux Klan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghetto", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "321454", "label": {"eng": "Ghetto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Duke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "343067", "label": {"eng": "David Duke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehumanization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "351125", "label": {"eng": "Dehumanization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yossi_Klein_Halevi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "704251", "label": {"eng": "Yossi Klein Halevi"}}]}

Lee in Charlottesville's Emancipation Park, formerly known as Lee Park.\n\nThis is part of Marc H. Ellis's \"Exile and the Prophetic\" feature for Mondoweiss. To read the entire series visit the archive page.\n\nCharlottesville and White nationalism have brought the issue of monuments commemorating the fallen to the forefront. The ongoing debate is about how history is interpreted and how it functions in the present. Much of how we remember is related to the way we want to feel about ourselves. It is also about the future we hope to bequeath to our children.\n\nThe White supremacists in Charlottesville are nostalgic for a world that may or may not have existed. Thinking of the past as better and to be revived in the present is dangerous on many levels. Those who want the past back are fooling themselves and others, too.\n\nCommemoration is like that and more. Often remembrance is a form of denial.\n\nRobert E. Lee, and his statue, is a case in point. Portrayed as a heroic General who reluctantly fought for a principled cause, history says something quite different. Lee was a slave-holder, and evidently a cruel one at that. After the end of the Civil War, Lee was largely unrepentant. His view of former slaves stayed much the same as it did during slavery.\n\nThere are other monuments to question than the those who celebrate the Confederacy in Charlottesville. A recent article in the New York Times draws attention to a small museum dedicated to Indonesia's former dictator, Suharto. Located in a small town amid the palm trees and rice fields of central Java, the title of the article is telling: Suharto Museum Celebrates Dictator's Life, Omitting Dark Chapters.\n\nJews are very present in the movement to oppose white supremacy. Along many others, Jews were involved in opposing white nationalism in Charlottesville. Yet, Jews have our own history to struggle with as well. Where and how the memory of our own suffering is portrayed is crucial to the Jewish future. It is hotly contested as well.\n\nThe issue here is not to create analogies but rather to see connections between historical commemorations and the present. On the Jewish side of things, it isn't about Jewish suffering itself but how commemoration of that suffering functions in the present.\n\nI think of Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial in Israel as, among other things, a monument. At Yad Vashem, the dark chapter of Jewish life is highlighted, as it should be. Israel as the chapter after the Holocaust is assumed, as it should be. But part of that chapter of Jewish life after the Holocaust, the Nakba is omitted. More and more Jews and non-Jews are asking about this part of Jewish life after the Holocaust and after the creation of the state of Israel.\n\nIn its history, the Holocaust stands alone. But the Holocaust's afterlife is something else. What does this monument to the Holocaust say to Palestinian refugees and Palestinians who continue to live under an ever tightening Israeli occupation? Some might think such a question blasphemous. Is it?\n\nIsrael's Holocaust museum also devotes time and energy to injustice, atrocity and genocides in history and the present. Its laudable aim is to avoid such events in the future. Yet Yad Vashem is located right in the middle of ethnically cleansed Palestinian land. It thrives amid a permanent Israeli occupation. What does this say to Jews who rightfully want to commemorate the Holocaust? Is the occupation of Palestine the lesson Jews learn from the Holocaust?\n\nThe Western Wall in Jerusalem is another monument that needs questioning in light of Charlottesville. Ostensibly part of the ancient destroyed Temple, its present configuration is defined internationally as existing on occupied Palestinian land. Moreover, the plaza designated for Jewish prayer was cleared of Palestinian housing and residents right as Israel occupied East Jerusalem after the 1967 War.\n\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the 1967 war raised critical questions about Israel's continuing occupation. Does our remembrance of the destroyed Temple, like the 1967 War, need to be reframed? After all, praying on occupied land with a history of being cleansed of its inhabitants presents a formidable challenge if one believes in a God of Justice.\n\nIn Jerusalem, as in Charlottesville, the struggle between opposing forces can sometimes hide what binds them together. History is like that sometimes. How we remember is telling. What we forget in that remembering is crucial. Can Israeli and Jewish life become whole again when its central historical monuments represent Jews as victims only, especially in a time of Jewish empowerment?\n\nCharlottesville should we be a wakeup call for Jews. The White supremacist chants - \"Jews Will Not Replace Us!\" - could be heard in the city and beyond. But, then, Jews have replaced Palestinians in too many parts of Israel.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label":

For example, he helped Chaim Weizmann raise funds for the purchase of land in Eretz Yisrael (1921); supported the establishment of Israel as the fulfillment of an ancient dream; and, in About Zionism (1931), spelled out his support for the creation of a Jewish homeland in Eretz Yisrael. He later appeared before the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry on Palestine to enter a strong plea in support of a Jewish homeland (1946).\n\nAfter barely escaping Germany himself, he never stopped thinking about his Jewish brethren who were left behind and he actively campaigned on their behalf, becoming one of the most prominent and outspoken supporters of Jews entrapped by the Holocaust.\n\nPresented here are three favorite Einstein letters from my collection that attest to his profound dedication to his fellow Jews.\n\n* * * * *\n\nEinstein devoted great effort to helping Jewish refugees escape the Nazis; he worked tirelessly to persuade political leaders, particularly in the United States and Europe, to take action to save Jews from the Shoah; and he was always diligent about writing letters to thank those who participated in the effort to save endangered Jews.\n\nOne such example is this beautiful June 10, 1939 correspondence on his personal letterhead in which he gives voice to his Jewish sensibilities and deep and emotional feelings for his persecuted co-religionists, extending his gratitude to Mr. Paul Hyman, president of the Elms Realty Co., Inc., for his efforts in providing support to recently immigrated Jewish refugees:\n\nMy dear [sic] Mr. Hyman:\n\nMay I offer my sincere congratulations to you on the splendid work you have undertaken on behalf of the refugees during Dedication Week.\n\nThe power of resistance which has enabled the Jewish people to survive for thousands of years has been based to a large extent on traditions of mutual helpfulness. In these years of affliction our readiness to help one another is being put to an especially severe test. May we stand this test as well as did our fathers before us.\n\nWe have no other means of self-defense than our solidarity and our knowledge that the cause for which we are suffering is a momentous and sacred cause.\n\nIt must be a source of deep gratification to you to be making so important a contribution toward rescuing our persecuted fellow-Jews from their calamitous peril and leading them toward a better future.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nThis letter was written only a few months before Kristallnacht (November 9-10, 1939). Though Hitler would not invade Poland until September 1, 1939, leading to Great Britain's formal declaration of war against Germany, the Nazis had been consistently and methodically persecuting Jews since Hitler seized power in 1933 and more overtly doing so after the enactment of the Nuremberg Laws (September 1935).\n\nAt the time Einstein wrote the letter, more than half of all immigrants to the United States were Jewish, most of them refugees fleeing the Nazis. However, American immigration regulations at the time required that most expatriate Jews applying for visas be sponsored by two American citizens (preferably by a relative) and Einstein himself personally wrote many such sponsorship letters. Though he does not specify the services provided by Mr. Hyman in support of Jewish rescue efforts, it is most likely related to sponsoring the immigration of Jews to America.\n\n\"Dedication Week\" was a campaign to raise public consciousness regarding the need for Jewish rescue. Less than two weeks before sending this letter, Einstein gave the official dedication speech for the Jewish Palestine Pavilion at the New York World's Fair to a crowd of 100,000 visitors, and Mr. Hyman was almost certainly among them. (See my Jewish Press front page essay \"The 1939 World's Fair Palestine Pavilion,\" Dec. 2, 20016.)\n\n* * * * *\n\nIn this incredible July 17, 1945 correspondence to Dr. Jacob Shatzky, Einstein evidences his Jewish sensibilities, his deep and personal connection to the Jewish people, the personal pain he felt for the Jews of Europe during the Shoah, and his personal involvement in raising crucial funds for the UJA:\n\nThrough the 1945 campaign of the United Jewish Appeal of Greater New York the men and women in your city can take part in one of the world's great humanitarian crusades.\n\nI was fortunate enough to have been spared the physical pain and the constant fear of death that came to those living under Hitler. Yet no man who knows what was going on - and I least of all - was able to escape the anguish caused by the knowledge that such barbarous persecution was being visited upon an entire people. All of us suffered with them in their woe, and rejoiced with them in their deliverance.\n\nFreedom without bread, it has been said, has little meaning. Of greatest importance at the present time, therefore, is the effort to bring food, medicine and shelter to the survivors; to rebuild their shattered lives; and to help the homeless by building up Palestine as a home and haven of refuge for additional tens of thousands.\n\nThe major agencies for carrying out this program are represented in the campaign of the United Jewish Appeal of Greater New York - and their minimum need for 1945 are $84,000,000 as compared to the $30,000,000 raised in 1944. Casual generosity will not meet this budget - only if each and every one of us digs deep and gives from all his resources, can we hope to raise the full sums required.\n\nJacob Shatzky (1893 - 1956) received a traditional cheder education in Warsaw before studying history and philosophy at universities in Lemberg and Vienna and receiving his Ph.D. from the University of Warsaw (1922), where his dissertation topic was \"The Jewish Question in the Kingdom of Poland during the Paskiewicz Era.\" After fighting with Pilsudski's Legion during World War I and winning several military decorations, he was asked by the Polish Foreign Ministry to report on Jewish affairs in Poland, particularly the April pogroms in Vilna. When the Ministry did not react to his report, he resigned his post and taught history at Jewish high schools in Warsaw.\n\nIn 1923, Shatzky immigrated to the United States where he established himself as a prominent Jewish historian. Although his deepest interest remained the history of the Jews in Poland, he published numerous studies on all aspects of Jewish history and also wrote extensively on Jewish literature, literary history, folklore, and biography. His best known works include The Chmielnicki Massacres of 1648 (1938); Jewish Educational Policy in Poland from 1806-1866 (1943); and The History of the Jews in Warsaw (3 volumes, 1947 - 1953).\n\n* * * * *\n\nFinally, in this April 21, 1948 correspondence in German (written one month before the birth of Israel) on his embossed letterhead to Dr. Frederic T. Weishut, Einstein manifests his belief in the Jewish God who looks after the affairs of man:\n\nMany thanks for sending the pictures [probably photographs], and also that you went to the pain of having them reproduced again. If you'd like any of them returned, please let me know.\n\nHoping that you are satisfied by your new position, I remain,\n\nWith friendly greetings,\n\nYours\n\nAlbert Einstein.\n\nP.S. Maybe [transliteration of God's Sacred Name] was looking out for you when you did not get the government position.\n\nEinstein was broadly regarded as the symbol and leader of the entire group of refugee scholars. Weishut, who had been the assistant to Einstein's late friend, the chemist Fritz Haber, was one of many scientists who obtained Einstein's assistance in emigrating to the United States in the face of Nazi persecution. Einstein seems to be suggesting that when Weishut failed to land a government position (most likely because he was Jewish), God was actually looking out for him and facilitated his leaving Germany before the Holocaust, thereby saving his life.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/History", "wgt": 100, "id": 1013, "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/History"}, {"uri":

It is concurrent with the turmoil prevailing at all levels inside the new administration.\n\nHowever, it is precisely at such a turbulent time -- when the leadership of American Jewry should assume a stabilizing role -- that American Jewish leaders seem to be losing control.\n\nMany Jewish leaders concentrate more on vilifying Trump than securing and promoting their communal interests. They unashamedly abuse their Jewish institutional roles to promote far-left and liberal agendas, even labeling their opponents as antisemites to achieve their goals.\n\nThat is not to deny that there has always been a segment of American society that was fiercely racist and antisemitic. The shocking displays of hatred and the violence emanating from the recent national gathering of white supremacists in Charlottesville testify to this. And while there was violence from the \"Antifa\" far-left elements, it is indisputable that the violence emanated from vile racists carrying Nazi flags.\n\nVice President Mike Pence denounced the white supremacists and racists but, to his discredit, Trump's initial response was only to condemn \"in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of bigotry, hatred and violence on many sides.\" Without explicitly condemning the white supremacists, he was perceived as applying moral equivalence to both sides, which most Americans and Jews of all political persuasions would consider outrageous. It was only two days later that Trump belatedly, explicitly denounced the racist hate groups such as white supremacists, neo-Nazis and KKK as criminals and thugs who are \"repugnant to everything we hold dear.\"\n\nThe threats from the radical right must not be tolerated. Yet despite the massive exposure they received, these fascist and racist groups represent a minute segment of society and their influence is marginal when compared to the leftist antisemites. The latter, who are vastly understated, promote the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel and have tried to transform campuses into anti-Israel and antisemitic platforms.\n\nMoreover, there are Jewish community leaders who have allied themselves with far-left campaigns headed by vicious anti-Israel elements, arguing that anti-Israel agitators should not be excluded as partners in broader campaigns for social justice. There are also calls for BDS proponents and anti-Israel Jewish groups to be included in the \"big tent.\"\n\nThe worst organizational offender in this area is the Anti-Defamation League, which lost its credibility after Jonathan Greenblatt, a former aide to President Barack Obama, became CEO and used the organization to promote his liberal agenda. He is supported by leaders of the Reform and Conservative movements, who uninhibitedly pursue partisan positions, as though their followers were all anti-Trump zealots. Their toleration of leftist, anti-Israel agitators is frequently accompanied by public criticism of Israeli policies.\n\nAlthough the racist demonstration in Charlottesville is evidence that there are threats from the right, the ADL focuses almost exclusively on right-wing extremists, conveying the impression that antisemitism primarily emanates from these quarters. The ADL even refused to break with the Black Lives Matter movement, despite the rabidly anti-Israel clauses in some of its platforms; the ADL alleges that the offending clauses were inserted by a small minority of Black Lives Matter supporters.\n\nThe ADL also blamed Trump's immigration policies and indifference to racists for the surge of bomb threats against Jewish institutions. Yet when it was revealed that the threats originated from a liberal and a mentally unstable Israeli, the ADL did not rescind its accusations. It continuously understates and fails to protest the growing numbers of anti-Israel elements who now thrive within the left-wing ranks of the Democratic Party, and are dominant on many campuses.\n\nAn extreme example of this antisemitism was the case of American imam, Ammar Shahin, who, in a sermon delivered at the Islamic Center of Davis in California on July 21, called for the annihilation of the Jewish people and \"the liberation of Al-Aqsa Mosque\" from \"the filth of the Jews.\" He described Jews as \"wicked\" and said, \"O Allah, destroy them and do not spare their young or elderly. ... O Allah, turn Jerusalem and Palestine into a graveyard for Jews.\" He has made similar outrageous remarks on other occasions.\n\nAfter the media quoted him, there were cries of outrage and calls for his dismissal. Under pressure, the imam conceded, \"I said things that were hurtful to Jews. This was unacceptable. ... I am deeply sorry for the pain inflicted. The last thing that I would do is intentionally hurt anyone, Muslim, Jewish or otherwise. It is not in my heart.\" The imam, however, did not retract his obscene remarks.\n\nThe ADL, which has been calling conservatives antisemites, failed to call for the ouster of the imam or call on the authorities to prosecute him for inciting violence. Instead, an ADL spokesman \"welcomed\" the \"apology,\" expressing \"the hope that the imam will continue to learn from others about why his words were so dangerous.\" Such a response from an organization whose raison d'etre is to lead the struggle against antisemitism was utterly pathetic and even contemptable.\n\nThere are many similar examples of acceptance of \"progressive\" anti-Zionists and antisemites, such as the praise that some liberal Jews have heaped on Linda Sarsour, the Palestinian-American head of the anti-Trump Women's March, who publicly embraced convicted terrorist Rasmea Odeh.\n\nSectors of the Jewish media also contribute to this atmosphere. The most extreme example was a recent article published in the left-leaning Forward by editorial columnist Steven Davidson. Davidson listed 19 people who he thought Jews should worry more about than Sarsour. Aside from Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the leaders of Hezbollah and Hamas -- who are listed toward the end of the article -- all the others except one are Nazis or racists or right-wingers whom Davidson dislikes, such as Trump's strategist Steve Bannon. Leftist antisemites were given a pass. But what makes this article scandalous is that the sixth person listed is Morton Klein, head of the Zionist Organization of America. Unbelievably, Klein is included with Islamist terrorists, Louis Farrakhan, David Duke and other antisemites.\n\nWhether one agrees or disagrees with Klein, he is a dedicated Zionist whose parents were Holocaust survivors. In my view, he was only included in this list because he is a strong opponent of far-left and liberal causes. His organization was a charter member of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, and he is highly respected in Israel. To bracket this man with Nazis is obscene and should never have been published in a Jewish media outlet that purports to be mainstream. But other than Alan Dershowitz, who rightly described the article as the \"most despicable ever in Jewish media,\" there was a curtain of silence from most Jewish leaders.\n\nThe editor, who, to the best of my knowledge, has yet to issue an apology for publishing this outrageous article, should either resign or be dismissed.\n\nThe tension between Israel and large segments of American Jewry was compounded when, to retain his government, Netanyahu capitulated to haredi extremist extortion and rescinded the deal with the non-Orthodox regarding their right to allow mixed services at a designated area at the Western Wall.\n\nWhile this is grounds for outrage by the non-Orthodox, prayer at the Western Wall has until now only attracted marginal numbers of progressives; this issue has been blown totally out of proportion.\n\nIt is surely not surprising that, in this environment, access to the US administration by Jewish leaders is lower than it has been in more than 50 years.\n\nThe Jewish community must take stock or it will lose all influence with the current government. The Trump administration appears divided over Israel, with the State Department resurrecting the Obama approach of appeasing the Arabs and applying moral equivalence to Israelis defending themselves and Palestinians engaging in incitement and terror. The Jewish leadership could have a positive influence in this area if it displayed political neutrality.\n\nCurrently Israel enjoys more support from Christian evangelicals than from Jews. American Jewish leaders should wake up now before it is too late, and their once influential community becomes marginalized.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri":

I have some experience with this, since my wife and I are celebrating our \"Aliyah-niversary\" this week having moved to Israel on a Nefesh B'Nefesh flight exactly six years ago.\n\nAt the time, we were living in Columbus, Ohio where I had grown up and worked as the pulpit rabbi of an Orthodox synagogue. We had three small children at the time and were living just a few blocks away from my parents. I loved my work at the synagogue and my wife felt equally fulfilled as a teacher at the local Jewish high school.\n\nNevertheless, there was something whispering into our ear and pulling at our heartstrings: Jewish destiny. Both of our families came from Europe where our grandparents survived the Holocaust.\n\nThey arrived in America as penniless orphans who built wonderful lives and raised families of proud patriots. Love for America and appreciation for what it offered was not something we took for granted. Yet, as committed Jews, we felt that -- like the kosher hotdog commercial -- we answered to a higher authority.\n\nThroughout history, Jews have lived in nearly every country in the world from ancient Babylonia to Spain in the medieval times and all across Europe in the modern era. No matter where and no matter when, Jews prayed each day that God should bring us back to the land of our forefathers.\n\nFor many generations of Jews, this hope for Zion was but a dream. I travelled to Eastern Europe last week to visit the towns in Hungary and the Ukraine where my own grandparents were born. Standing in the desolate synagogues that were once vibrant houses of worship before the Holocaust, I recalled stories my grandmother told me about how her own mother would read to her stories about Jerusalem with tears in her eyes.\n\nCertainly, my great-grandmother could never have fathomed raising her own six children in Israel. Instead, she raised her kids in the Ukraine, until her husband was sent to forced labor and she was thrown onto a cattle car with her little ones to Auschwitz.\n\nThe modern state of Israel was created in 1948, just three years after the Holocaust. In less than 70 years, Israel has become a strong democracy with a booming economy. It has turned its vast desert wastelands into agricultural gardens of eden and absorbed millions of Jewish immigrants from over 100 countries.\n\nBefore World War II, there were 17 million Jews in the world with less than half a million in Israel. Today, we still have not recovered from the loss of the 6 million victims of the Holocaust and there are about 15 million Jews worldwide. What is nothing short of miraculous is that today, there are about 6.5 million Jews living in Israel, more than any other country.\n\nThe ancient promises outlined repeatedly throughout the Bible are finally coming true. Isaiah (43:5) wrote, \"I will bring your descendants from the east, And gather you from the west . . . bring My sons from afar, and My daughters from the ends of the earth.\" Jeremiah (23:3) similarly promised, \"I will gather the remnant of My flock out of all countries where I have driven them, and bring them back to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase.\"\n\nTo the Jewish people, Israel is not just another country, it is our homeland. When American Jews move to Israel, as 233 did this week, we are not turning our back on America, but turning towards our heritage.\n\nRabbi Weisz is the director of Israel365, which connects 2 million people to Israel every month.

He thanks the Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme in Palestine and Israel (EAPPI) for the invitation to speak. It was originally published on the Patheos site.\n\nA movement requires a broad consensus.\n\nThere's has to be some agreement on the nature of the problem and what the best outcome would be.\n\nIt needs a clear, easy to understand message. A bold ambition. But, ultimately, an achievable one.\n\nSomething that most people can unite around.\n\nWhen it comes to Israel/Palestine we still don't have that single, bold, unifying message.\n\nPersonally, I don't believe our starting point should be 'anti-Occupation' or 'anti-Settlements'.\n\nI don't believe a movement should be built around the idea of 'Two States'. Or 'One State'. Or 'Boycotts'.\n\nNone of these things, on their own, quite captures where we need to be.\n\nA real broad-based movement requires something more fundamental. Something more elemental. Something that needs to be agreed upon before anything is considered.\n\nLuckily for you, I have that clear, bold, easy to understand message.\n\nBut tragically, it's also highly contentious. Highly controversial.\n\nThe strange thing is that calling for equal rights is generally considered 'a good thing.' At least it is in Western liberal democracies.\n\nExcept when it comes to Israel, when suddenly a whole set of other considerations come in to play.\n\nBecause equal rights, International Law, UN Security Council resolutions don't appear to count for much when it comes to Israel/Palestine.\n\nSo what does count?\n\nWell, the relationship between Christians and Jews in Europe across two millennia, counts.\n\nHow the West, and most Jews, have come to understand the Holocaust, counts.\n\nJewish understanding of the 'right to national self-determination', counts.\n\nRecent definitions of antisemitism that attach themselves to a political agenda, count.\n\nThe international arms trade and the demand for high tech civil surveillance equipment, also now count.\n\nNone of these things are terribly helpful when it comes to building a movement based on equal rights for all who call the Holy Land home.\n\nWe have created too much complexity, too many excuses. Far too many reasons to justify injustice.\n\nBut despite all that's in our way, I still believe that the concept of equality is where we should start. Because starting out from any other place quickly leads you back to inequality.\n\nThat central message of equality may derive from religious belief or secular belief. I don't mind how you get there, as long as you get there.\n\nHow this then plays out in practical arrangements on the ground could go in a number of directions.\n\nTwo states, one state, a federation. But if our starting point is equality, backed up by equal rights for everyone from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, then that will radically alter the nature of the discussions from day one.\n\nIf you've read any of my writing over the last six years, you'll know that I come at all of this from a particular Jewish perspective.\n\nI come to this issue out of solidarity with the Palestinian people but I come to it firstly from a concern for the future of Jews and Judaism.\n\nI'm in no doubt that as Jews, our relationship with Israel and the Palestinians is the greatest issue, and the greatest challenge, facing us in the 21st century.\n\nEverything else either relates to that relationship, or it pales into insignificance against it.\n\nThe tragedy is that right now we are making a terrible hash of it.\n\nFrom my perspective I'd like to build a movement on Israel/Palestine that has widespread Jewish support. But I can't because most Jews in Britain are still asking themselves, and everyone else, the wrong questions about Israel/Palestine.\n\nI find it exasperating that my community consistently asks the wrong questions, counts the wrong things, and mistakes symptoms for causes.\n\nThere is a paradox at the heart of modern Jewish identity.\n\nIt goes like this:\n\n\"We wholeheartedly support equality in every land apart from the place we call our national home. There we claim privilege, we claim superior rights, we claim a superior history, we claim a unique story of oppression which, we argue, requires a unique and discriminatory response.\"\n\nThere's not time for me to discuss the seamless merger that has taken place over the last 70 years between Judaism and Zionism and modern Jewish identity.\n\nAll I'll say is that the merger has taken us down a moral cul-de-sac that's now very difficult to walk back out from.\n\nIt's a cul-de-sac that's left us bereft of the vocabulary, whether religious or secular, to make sense of what has taken place and what's still taking place in the name of the Jewish people and Judaism itself.\n\nI would love it if my own people could do some catching up and recognise that we are no longer the victimised people, no longer the oppressed people.\n\nFor perhaps the first time in two millennia we are strong, we have status and we have respect.\n\nIn all of those places where we enjoy equal rights we have succeeded and we have made outstanding contributions to those societies.\n\nIn Israel we have something more. We have power over another people. We are not handling it well.\n\nHowever, most of us still don't see it like that.\n\nBut to build a movement you can't afford to move at the pace of the slowest participant.\n\nEspecially, if they still don't really see the problem in the first place.\n\nBecause if you say: \"Zionism is nothing more and nothing less than a Jewish movement of national liberation and self-determination\", then, I can't work with you.\n\nMostly because you need to read more books and talk to some different people and you need to understand what happens when your sacrosanct understanding of Jewish identity plays out as a catastrophe for another people.\n\nIf you say that Zionism is a \"noble and integral part of Judaism\", then, I can't work with you.\n\nMostly because you are very ignorant about Jewish history and Jewish theological understanding of exile - and this is especially problematic if you also happen to be Britain's Chief Rabbi.\n\nIf you say boycotts in support of Palestinian rights are a form of antisemitism and/or should be illegal, then I can't work with you.\n\nMostly because you don't understand the history of political protest and you certainly don't understand Nazi Germany boycotts of Jewish businesses in the 1930s, and because you also oppose free speech.\n\nOr perhaps, you do understand all these things but you prefer to play politics with history for the sake of a very narrow and short sighted advantage.\n\nIf you can't acknowledge that Israel/Palestine is an asymmetrical conflict in which one side has power, and a state apparatus, and a standing army, and is maintaining an illegal occupation with the backing of the world's super power, then I'm going to struggle to work with you.\n\nMostly because you are in a serious state of denial.\n\nIf you count incidents of antisemitism but refuse to acknowledge that Israel's behaviour and our Jewish community insistence that Israel is central to Jewish identity are contributing factors to that antisemitism, then I can't work with you.\n\nMostly because you're debasing the meaning of antisemitism and reducing all criticism of Israel to mindless hatred.\n\nIf you think it's okay to hang out with Christian Zionists who love the State of Israel but have a theological problem with Judaism, then I can't work with you.\n\nMostly because you think Jewish nationalism is more important than Judaism itself.\n\nSo I don't think I can work with such people but I am happy to talk to them. I don't want to demonise those I don't agree with. I don't think that's right or helpful.\n\nBut the truth is they don't want to talk to me.\n\nI receive many invitations to speak from across the country. Thank you for your invitation today. But I've not had a single one from a mainstream Jewish organisation. In their opposition to boycotts, there's lots of talk of \"bridge building\" and \"local dialogue\" from the leadership of my community, as if the heart of the problem is that Jewish Israelis and Palestinians just need to get to know each other better.\n\nBut if you question Zionism (whether you are Jewish or not) you find yourself firmly boycotted.\n\nThat tells me something about the inability of the Jewish community in Britain to cope with open debate on this issue. It also tells me the limits of including mainstream Jewish institutions and their leaders in a movement based on equality through equal rights. They don't have the language or conceptual thinking that will allow them to champion Jews and Judaism and at the same time lead us back out of the ethical cul-de-sac of Zionism.\n\nThere are other people I have an even more serious problem with.\n\nThey are the people who claim to be motivated by Palestinian solidarity but who too easily slip into real antisemitism in their opposition to Israel.\n\nIf you say the Holocaust didn't happen, I don't want to talk to you. And you need help.\n\nIf you say there's a Jewish media conspiracy, or Jewish control of governments or international finance then I'm not interested in working with you or talking to you. You need to grow up.\n\nIf you say Jews have no place in Palestine, I can't work with you.\n\nIf you think a Free Palestine is free of Jews, I can't work with you.\n\nSo now I've ruled out so many people, let me finish with who I can work with and where we should look to build a global movement.\n\nIf you're starting position is equality through equal rights, whether you are Jewish, Christian or Muslim, I can work with you.\n\nIf you can accept that a great injustice has taken place against the Palestinian people, then I can work with you.\n\nIf you agree that Boycotts, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) are legitimate forms of protest, even if you don't want to take that action yourself, then I can work with you.\n\nIf you think liberal democratic societies that respect and protect all of their citizens are good for all people, everywhere, regardless of history, culture and religion, that's fantastic, I can work with you.\n\nI'm in no doubt that this will not be easy or straight forward.\n\nA movement based on equal rights will be shunned, attacked, and yes, branded as antisemitic.\n\nBut the principle of equal rights is the place to begin the journey and from which to build the movement.\n\nEqual rights recognises that that this is not about terrorism, it's not about security, it's not about competing nationalisms, it's not about antisemitism.\n\nEqual rights recognises there has been a great injustice that must be acknowledged in order to move on.\n\nEqual rights recognises that there is no pre-Zionist Palestine to return to. Both people are now permanently part of the future landscape.\n\nEqual rights recognises that both Jews and Palestinians are connected to the land - historically, culturally, religiously. It even recognises that American and Russian born West Bank Settlers, whether we like how they got there or not, also have rights.\n\nFor me this must be the basis of the movement. It may sound outrageous to some ears. But the more people like me that say it, the easier it becomes to have this new conversation. What is now considered political suicide, or in my case 'self-hatred', starts to become normal discourse.\n\nSo we need a 'paradigm shift' and that means taking this issue away from our current crop of world leaders, certainly May, Macron and Trump.

Lee. It was about asserting the legitimacy of \"white culture\" and white supremacy, and defending the legacy of the Confederacy.\n\nSo why did the demonstrators chant anti-Semitic lines like \"Jews will not replace us\"?\n\nThe demonstration was suffused with anti-black racism, but also with anti-Semitism. Marchers displayed swastikas on banners and shouted slogans like \"blood and soil,\" a phrase drawn from Nazi ideology. \"This city is run by Jewish communists and criminal niggers,\" one demonstrator told Vice News' Elspeth Reeve during their march. As Jews prayed at a local synagogue, Congregation Beth Israel, men dressed in fatigues carrying semi-automatic rifles stood across the street, according to the temple's president. Nazi websites posted a call to burn their building. As a precautionary measure, congregants had removed their Torah scrolls and exited through the back of the building when they were done praying.\n\n\"This is an agenda about celebrating the enslavement of Africans and their descendants, and celebrating those that then fought to preserve that terrible machine of white supremacy and human enslavement,\" said Jonathan Greenblatt, the head of the Anti-Defamation League, or ADL. \"And yet, somehow, they're all wearing shirts that talk about Adolf Hitler.\"\n\nFor these demonstrators, though, the connection between African Americans and Jews is clear. In the minds of white supremacists like David Duke, there is a straight line from anti-blackness to anti-Judaism. That logic is powerful and important. The durability of anti-Semitic tropes, and the ease with which they slide into all displays of bigotry, is a chilling reminder that the hatreds of our time rhyme with history and are easily channeled through timeless anti-Semitic canards.\n\nThe University of Chicago historian David Nirenberg has spent his career studying anti-Jewish movements and beliefs. Recently, he spoke to a group of students about anti-Semitism on college campuses. \"At the end of the ... talk, I said, 'I wouldn't rush from all this material to thinking that this anti-Semitism is as dangerous as its early 20th-century predecessor,'\" he told me. \"Seeing the images of the Virginia protest, I must admit, I kind of felt otherwise. ... It certainly made me feel that books and ideas that I had treated as very marginal in our society are not as marginal as I might have hoped.\"\n\nAnti-Semitism often functions as a readily available language for all manner of bigotry -- a Rosetta Stone that can translate animus toward one group into a universal hate for many groups. \"Ever since St. Paul, Christianity and all the religions born from it -- Islam, the secular philosophies of Europe, etc. -- learned to think about their world in terms of overcoming the dangers of Judaism,\" said Nirenberg. \"We have these really basic building blocks ... for thinking about the world and what's wrong with it ... by thinking about Judaism.\"\n\nIn the world sketched by white supremacists, Jews hover malevolently in the background, pulling strings, controlling events, acting as an all-powerful force backing and enabling the other targets of their hate. That's clear in statements made by people like Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader who proudly marched with other white supremacists in Charlottesville. Jewish Zionists, he complained to a gathered crowd, control the media and American political system.\n\n\"The extreme right considers many people their threat. But it always, always, always comes back to the Jews.\"\n\nAnti-black and anti-Jewish sentiment have long been intertwined in America. When the Jewish factory worker Leo Frank was wrongfully convicted of murder and lynched in 1915, two new groups simultaneously emerged: the ADL, which fights against bigotry and anti-Semitism, and the second Ku Klux Klan, which began by celebrating Frank's death. Later in the 20th century, Nazis became a natural model for white-supremacist movements in the United States, said Marjorie Feld, a professor of history at Babson College. The logic of white supremacy was similar: Hatreds became universalized through common archetypes. Jews were seen by white supremacists as capitalists undermining local businesses. Black Americans fleeing the South in the Great Migration were seen as taking away crucial labor. Catholics were seen as immigrants stealing American jobs.\n\nAfter the Holocaust, neo-Nazi movements were largely consigned to the country's political fringe, although they never fully left the American landscape. In 1978, for example, a Nazi group pushed to demonstrate in Skokie, Illinois, deliberately selecting an area densely populated by Holocaust survivors. The proposed march caused a national uproar, and the American Civil Liberties Union famously defended the group's First Amendment rights in court. Eventually, they ended up demonstrating in Chicago.\n\nThe Charlottesville demonstration differed from the planned Skokie march in two important respects, Nirenberg said. First of all, there's a political context for the \"Unite the Right\" demonstration. It fits into debates over free speech and college campuses as the front lines of cultural battle, he said. The Skokie march was also widely and vigorously condemned by political leaders. \"That strong, clear commitment to certain values of inclusion from our political leaders is not present in the same way,\" Nirenberg said.\n\nOn Monday, President Donald Trump held a press conference about the violence in Charlottesville. \"Racism is evil,\" he said. \"Those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.\" This statement came two days after his initial comments on the protests, in which he condemned the \"hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides.\" The suggested equivalence between the white-supremacist demonstrators and their counter-protesters shocked politicians and public figures in both parties, who quickly criticized Trump's unwillingness to condemn neo-Nazis and the KKK. \"It's very clear that the people marching in Charlottesville felt very supported by the shape of the public statements made by President Trump,\" said Nirenberg. On Tuesday, the president held another press conference in which he reiterated his previous claims, saying, \"What about the alt-left that came charging ... with clubs in their hands? Do they have any problem? I think they do.\"\n\nGreenblatt argued that the backlash against Trump's comments is not about politics -- it's about recognizing a pattern of anti-Semitism. There was the Holocaust Remembrance Day statement that didn't mention Jews; the conspiratorial meme of Hillary Clinton and a Star of David that Trump retweeted during the campaign; the infamous Nazi salute and shouts of \"Hail Trump!\" at an alt-right conference following the election. In the past several days, a number of groups have renewed their calls for Trump to fire Steve Bannon, his chief strategist, in part based on Bannon's role in heading Breitbart, which he called a \"platform for the alt-right.\"\n\nTo people like Greenblatt, these are all signs that, at best, the White House does not take anti-Semitism seriously enough. At worst, the Trump administration indulges bigotry so as not to alienate some supporters. \"Heck, there's Jewish grandchildren running around the White House,\" Greenblatt said. \"But make no mistake, the extreme right considers many people their threat, but it always, always, always comes back to the Jews.\"\n\n\"You just can't say this as a historian, but I feel like we're at this critical juncture.\"\n\nAs Nirenberg pointed out, the violence in Charlottesville was part of a broader political context. The fringe right is reacting to other political movements with nostalgia, Feld said -- a yearning for people, including minorities like Jews and blacks, to \"know their place.\"\n\n\"It makes sense to me that just as ... we're seeing people of all backgrounds be brave enough to insist that these monuments about slavery\" be toppled, Feld said, \"these people would come out and say we would want to return to the way things were.\"\n\nThe identity politics of the intersectional left are radically different from the generalized bigotry of the far-right fever swamps. And yet, they are in relationship: Universalized movements that aim to fight oppression against all peoples in all of their identities necessarily invite backlash from those who feel that they're losing their place in society. \"It would really reduce and impoverish debate to see this example as primarily an anti-Jewish rally ... [or] as entirely an anti-African American rally. It's all those things,\" said Nirenberg. \"To the extent that we separate those and claim, 'No, it's only about my identity,' we fail to understand basic aspects of identity politics in the present.'\"\n\nOf course there are neo-Nazis in our time. There are those who hate Jews in every time. It's a hatred that easily flickers between the universal and the particular, melding with the similarly particular hatreds of blacks and immigrants and other minority groups. \"You just can't say this as a historian, but I feel like we're at this critical juncture,\" Feld said. \"I don't feel like the world is unsafe for Jews. I really don't. But I do feel like all social groups need to pay careful attention and speak out against what's happening.\"\n\nLike Nirenberg, Feld was trained to look at the images coming out of Charlottesville and see not a freak occurrence, but the echoes of history.\n\n\"God,\" she said. \"It's fucking scary.\"", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41,

We don't have to look only to Charlottesville to witness or experience antisemitism and racism. We have heard that white nationalist rallies may be planned in Atlanta this weekend and in the days to come. We will follow the recommendations of the ADL and other groups who monitor hate activity as to the best course of action for us as a congregation.\n\nThe premeditated targeting of civilians for political purposes by white supremacists and anti-Semites is domestic terrorism and has no place in America. If we as a Jewish community stand for anything, if our history matters not just for ourselves but as a beacon of justice for humanity, if we pride ourselves on being a prophetic voice, let us never stand idly by.\n\nAs antisemitic and racist activity continues to escalate, we have a moral responsibility to act: name it, condemn it, and do something about it... but don't stand idly by. We as a people and certainly as a congregation have never stood silent in the face of such moral atrocity.\n\nAs we approach this New Year, we as a country must rediscover our sense of horror and dread in the face of wrongdoing; to remember that some things in this world are absolutely and utterly wrong and must be called out.\n\nWe are not alone in standing up to hatred and violence. We have each other. And, we are part of our Reform Movement, a network of hundreds of congregations and over a million Jews working together to pursue a better world. We invite you to join the work that we are doing as a movement and here at The Temple. This year, there are several ways to get involved:\n\nAt times like this, as we look at our social media feeds, we may feel overwhelmed and isolated. Let us remember one of our core values at Temple - we need each other. We need each other not only to act, but to listen, to pray, and to offer one another comfort and hope. To that end, we invite you to join us for worship services and other communal gatherings. As always, your clergy are always available offer pastoral counseling and spiritual support.\n\nPlease know that we are always security conscious at The Temple. We work every day to make The Temple a safe place through our excellent relationship with and presence of law enforcement, ongoing training and security equipment, and our agency partners.\n\nMay we all be comforted at this difficult time. May we use it to realize the blessings we have in our lives to be messengers of God to this world in which we live. Then, indeed, it will be a better world for us, for our children, and for our children's children.\n\nRabbi Joshua Heller, Congregation B'nai Torah\n\nThe Eclipse came a week earlier than expected. The sun went out during broad daylight, metaphorically speaking, in Charlottesville, Virginia. Members of the \"alt-right\" held a racist rally which spun off a number of violent assaults on bystanders and counter-protestors, and culminated in an murderous attack which left one dead and many injured.\n\nMany of our leaders have spoken out strongly against the rally and the violence it spawned. Others have equivocated, saying that there are \"many sides.\" As my colleague, Rabbi Barry Dov Katz wrote \"There can be only one side when it comes to racism, hatred, and antisemitism. Against.\"\n\nIt is true that there are many kinds of hate and violence in the world. My heart grows weary of they daily attacks on the innocent, and the \"slacktivism\" of Facebook condemnations yields diminishing returns. However, special attention must be paid to those who claim to speak for America, and dress themselves in the garb and the ideals of Nazis and slave masters. Holding a swastika or the \"Stars and Bars\" in one's hand should be offensive to all, but it is an even more profound desecration when the American flag is being held in the other hand.\n\nAs Jews, we have an obligation to stand up against hate wherever it may arise, but we have specific cause for concern. Even though the alleged provocation of the march was the removal of Confederate memorials, the messaging to rally these groups to the march featured the smashing of a Jewish star as its logo.\n\nIn ancient times, eclipses were occasion for panic- was the sun going out forever, or would it return in just a few moments? We would prefer to think that this is an isolated incident- that in a few moments the sun will shine again. The problem is that those who previously thrived and swarmed only in darkness are now stepping out into the light, into new influence. Over the last year, there have been increased incidences of racist and anti-semitic attacks across the country. These are not only large-scale incidents like the ones in Whitefish, Montana, but ones here in local Atlanta high schools that have been kept out of the press.\n\nSome of my friends in the Jewish community assure me that we are safe because the president, though he is reluctant to call out or condemn racist and anti-semitic groups that support him, has Jewish children and grandchildren. Indeed, the White House later offered a revised statement which was more direct in its condemnation. It may indeed be true that he has no animus towards Jews, but simply appreciates support from wherever it may come. However, if these groups are allowed to continue to grow in power and influence, we may not be so lucky with the next.\n\nThere will be counterprotests, vigils and rallies, petitions and blog posts and words of condemnation, displays of friendship and unity. They deserve our support and participation. I fear, however, that they will be undertaken, at least primarily, by the \"usual suspects,\" and that as a result their influence will fade to an faint echo in the insulated corridors of power. That makes the voice of another group all the more important at this moment.\n\nI have friends who view themselves as supporters of the current administration, for any number of reasons, perhaps including concern over a particular litmus-test ideological issue, seeing themselves as beneficiaries of its policies, or simply desiring a change from what had been. It is not for me to change their minds on that support. However, it is these friends who have a particular obligation to speak up and express their concern, to ensure that they do not find themselves standing in coalition with \"friends of friends\" who would seek to destroy us. Our friends must speak now, when their voices will be heard loudly and clearly, lest the day come when they, too, are silenced. This eclipse is only temporary, but there is a greater darkness of night that may still follow, and if it does, it will fall on all, not just on one place.\n\nConference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations\n\nLeaders of the Conference of Presidents today strongly condemned the violence and hateful expressions of bigotry by white supremacists and neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Virginia this past weekend, and expressed condolences to the families of Heather Heyer and the two Charlottesville police officers whose lives were tragically lost.\n\nStephen M. Greenberg, Chairman and Malcolm Hoenlein, Executive Vice Chairman/CEO said, \"We add our strong condemnation to those leaders in government, religious bodies, the media, civil society and the business community who have clearly and forcefully denounced the white supremacists and neo-Nazi messages of hate which incited murderous violence in Charlottesville, resulting in the death of Heather Heyer and injuries to many others. We send our condolences to the Heyer family and to the families of the police officers.\n\nThe overt racism, anti-Semitism, bigotry and wanton acts of violence unleashed on the streets of Charlottesville are a chilling example of the damage hate inflicts on our society and a tragic reminder of the responsibility we all have to identify and call out the perpetrators of these vile manifestations.\n\nWhile eliminating hate or preventing the haters from spewing vile ideas is not possible, we can and must isolate them, ensure they are condemned by our elected leaders and the overwhelming majority of the American people, and urge authorities at all levels to act against them.\n\nWe welcome the announcement by Attorney General Sessions that the Justice Department has commenced a full investigation and will be devoting substantial resources of the federal government to the efforts of state and local law enforcement in bringing the perpetrators to justice.\"\n\nJewish Council for Public Affairs\n\nThe Jewish Council for Public Affairs (JCPA) condemns the violent, racist, anti-Semitic, and hate-filled \"Unite the Right\" rally by white nationalist groups in Charlottesville, Virginia on Saturday. We urge President Trump to directly denounce, in no uncertain terms and without equivocation, the white nationalist marchers and to make fighting hate a number one priority of his administration. Leadership must begin at the top.\n\nJCPA expresses heartfelt condolences to the three families of those who died needlessly due to this rally.\n\n\"In moments like these, it's critical that our political leaders speak in a clear voice opposing hatred,\" stated JCPA Board Chair Cheryl Fishbein. \"What our leaders do and say sets the parameters for the rest of the society.\"\n\n\"There is no comparison between the protestors, who brought hate and violence to the streets of one of the symbolic birth places of American democracy, and the counter protestors,\" said David Bernstein, JCPA's President and CEO. \"The Rally was one of the largest showings from a hate group in decades. We stand with people of good will from all walks of life who are speaking out against hate. We must drive it back into the underground and to the margins of society.\"\n\nResponding to this state of emergency, our network is standing against hate in their local communities and many participated in the approximately 680 vigils and rallies organized today around the country.\n\nJCPA represents the Jewish Community Relations Councils (JCRCs) who work tirelessly to build tolerance, civility, and maintain friendships with diverse partners across the country. We believe that we must continue to work toward a more just and equitable society in which we can all live together. These values are what make America the great country that it is today.\n\nAmerican Jewish Committee\n\nDear President Trump,\n\nI write to you as the CEO of a non-governmental organization, American Jewish Committee (AJC), which has been an integral part of the American landscape since our founding in 1906.\n\nWe are a fiercely non-partisan group - driven by policies, not parties; by issues, not individuals; by values, not votes.\n\nWhat we witnessed in Charlottesville on Friday and Saturday was nothing short of horrifying.\n\nIt was sickening enough to see people drawn together by the siren songs of white supremacy, the Ku Klux Klan, and neo-Nazism. But however repugnant their views may be, so long as they conducted themselves peacefully, their freedom of speech is protected in our blessed land.\n\nBut it was abundantly clear that at least some of these racists, anti-Semites, and homophobes came to Charlottesville looking for trouble. The result is now well-known. A young woman, with so much to look forward to in her life, was killed, and many others were injured, some in serious condition.\n\nMr. President, precisely at such moments of national tragedy and, yes, definition, your voice becomes essential. Others cannot substitute for you. You are our leader, you set the tone, and you have an incomparable bully pulpit.\n\nThus, when you chose to use those three words describing the hatred - \"on many sides\" - and to repeat them twice, alas, you turned what should have been a unifying moment into a divisive one.\n\nRespectfully, whatever your intention might have been, your remark could be interpreted to suggest a moral equivalence between the bigots and those who stood against them. In our view, that was totally unwarranted and needed quick clarification.\n\nIt is late, but not too late, we believe, to set the record straight.\n\nWe hope you will make clear that our nation does not countenance the warped views of bigots, as was on display in Charlottesville. Their approach tears at the pluralistic fabric of our great country, just as it has done for centuries, and endangers the notable progress we have made in recent decades under both Republican and Democratic administrations.\n\nWe also urge you to send a strong message to these extremist groups that their endorsement is not welcome. Of course, every political leader seeks support from a range of voters, but, surely, there are limits, and those who preach racial supremacy, religious bigotry, and ethnic division, should be deemed well beyond the pale.\n\nAnd finally, we count on the Department of Justice, as Attorney General Sessions has indicated, to investigate thoroughly the violence in Charlottesville, and leave no stone unturned in the process.\n\nFor us, we can find no other words to describe what happened on Saturday than domestic terrorism - the premediated targeting of civilians for political purposes.\n\nJust as what occurred so tragically in other American places - from Fort Hood to Charleston, from Boston to Oklahoma City, and the list goes on - the full force of the law, coupled with the moral leadership of our elected officials and the coalition of conscience of civil society, must always be our resolute answer.\n\nThank you for your consideration of this heartfelt plea.\n\nDavid Harris, AJC executive director\n\nB'nai B'rith International\n\nOn Aug. 13:\n\nWe vehemently condemn the white supremacist and neo-Nazi-backed sentiments and subsequent violence in Charlottesville, Va. The disgraceful rally these groups convened was for the express purpose of gathering hate-mongers and extremists to intimidate all people and undermine the very principles of our democracy. Racist and anti-Semitic epithets were on vulgar display by these groups.\n\nThis abominable gathering serves as an important reminder that we must unite to stand against hatred and extremism. There are not \"many sides\" to the type of hate displayed at this rally.\n\nFrom each individual through neighborhoods, communities, towns, cities, states and the nation as a whole, all Americans of good conscious must reject divisiveness and strive to embrace tolerance and unity.\n\nOn Aug. 16:\n\nPresident Trump has returned to an indefensible position on the sickening violence that took place in Charlottesville at the \"Unite the Right\" rally.\n\nInstead of asserting leadership and forcefully condemning the alt-right, he is once again equivocating.\n\nThere is no doubt that the white supremacists and neo-Nazis, with their vulgar messages of violence and exclusion, must be called out in unambiguous terms at the highest level. In the absence of a strong White House statement, the message received by these groups, who feel emboldened, is that their hatred and violence are somehow acceptable. The extremists are encouraged and their views are bolstered in this leadership vacuum.\n\nThe president needs to display unquestionable clarity that sets a tone for the standards of tolerance and inclusion that have long defined our democracy.\n\nHis message must state unambiguously and forcefully that this hatred is rejected.\n\nEach moment that goes by without moral clarity from the White House is a moment that the extremists gain a greater foothold to undermine our collective values.\n\nJewish War Veterans\n\nOn August 11th, an estimated 100 white supremacists marched through the University of Virginia (UVA) campus with their tiki torches full of citronella and their hearts filled with hate. They were recorded shouting racist, anti-Semitic Nazi slogans - such as \"Blood and Soil\" and \"Jews will not replace us\".\n\nThe next day, counter protesters showed up to face the over 4,000 white supremacists who were gathered. The situation devolved into one of the saddest days for American democracy. Citizens were beating each other bloody, and the National Guard was ultimately called in after a State of Emergency was enacted in Virginia. While the crowds were dispersing, a white supremacist plowed his car into a group of counter protesters - this terrorist act killed 1 and left injured 19.\n\nThis is not America. The United States of America is the land of liberty, and to quote George Bernard Shaw said, \"liberty means responsibility - that is why most men dread it.\" When people are using hate in your name, you have the responsibility to call them out and tell them this is not what you stand for. When you are a part of one of the worst displays of anarchy in this nation's recent history, you are responsible for your action or lack thereof.\n\nIt is important to remember that this is not the first time America has seen Nazi symbols marching through her streets. In the 1930s, Nazi sympathizers, called Bunds, would proudly hold rallies, assemble youth camps and march through the streets of our nation. The Jewish War Veterans of the U.S.A. (JWV) were the first to see that this hate has no place in America. We organized over 10,000 members to march through the streets of New York, an event that ended up on the front page of every major newspaper.\n\nAfter that parade, \"Hitler and his cohorts were made to see that America was aroused - that Americans would not stand for atrocities and injustices against any minority people.\" Today, the white supremacists must be made to see that there is no place for their hatred in our society.\n\nIt is also important to remember that these white supremacists were 4,000 people out 360 million citizens of America, and they are by no means the majority. Even so, JWV remains committed to taking a strong active role against the growing white supremacist movement. JWV members have been in contact with the UVA Hillel, supporting them within our means. We remain vigilant within our own communities, and will help in any way if called upon.\n\n\"Today the JWV continues to stand firmly against hatred. We call upon all elected officials at all echelons of government to clearly speak out against White Supremacists, Neo-Nazi's and their fellow travelers,\" stated National Commander Carl Singer.\n\nU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum\n\nThe United States Holocaust Memorial Museum mourns the loss of life in Charlottesville, Virginia, and strongly condemns the violence and neo-Nazi, racist, and antisemitic symbols and language used by some of the participants, including reported chants of, \"The Jews will not overtake us.\" Neo-Nazism in any form is antithetical to American values and has no place in American society.\n\nHolocaust history teaches that the targeting of Jews was central to Nazi racist ideology and that it began with hateful rhetoric. By the end of World War II, the Germans and their collaborators had murdered six million Jews and millions of other innocent civilians, many of whom were also targeted for racial reasons.\n\nAnti-Defamation League\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League (ADL) called on President Donald Trump to follow up his words earlier today with a strong plan of action that will ensure the kind of white supremacist violence and anti-Semitic and racist incitement witnessed in Charlottesville will not happen again.\n\nEarlier today in remarks from the White House, President Trump denounced the haters and white supremacists involved in the violence in Charlottesville, and called out the tragic loss of life that came about as a result of the so-called \"Unite the Right\" rally. But his statement came two days after the events, and after a disappointing initial reaction from the President that seemed to equate the haters with counter protesters.\n\n\"This is a moment when we desperately need leadership,\" said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO. \"But I think we should expect our leader in the highest office in the land to step above the lowest possible bar. Statements are not sufficient at this stage in the game. We need to move from words to action. The threat is not over. The hate groups are feeling emboldened and are already organizing a number of other rallies. The President needs to engage broadly, with leaders in Congress and others in the civil rights community, to execute a plan to stop the threat of further violence.\"\n\nAmong the displays of hate witnessed during the Charlottesville rally were anti-Semitic chants such as \"Jews will not replace us!\" and \"Sieg Heil\"; people bearing torches marching through the town doing \"Heil Hitler\" salutes; swastikas and confederate flags carried side by side by racists; and chants of \"Blood and Soil,\" which are ripped directly from Nazi-era slogans.\n\nADL called on the White House to take the following action steps:\n\nADL's Center on Extremism is currently monitoring additional rallies and other activity by white supremacist and all types of extremists.\n\nHIAS\n\nHIAS, the global Jewish nonprofit that protects refugees, is horrified by the violence, hatred and loss of life over the weekend in Charlottesville.\n\nIn response, HIAS President and CEO Mark Hetfield issued the following statement:\n\n\"In the wake of the racist attacks in Charlottesville, we at HIAS are heartbroken. While America has been struggling for over two centuries to live up to its founding ideal of equality for all people, it is clear that we still have a long way to go. Racism, xenophobia and hatred continue to infect this country.\n\n\"We condemn in the strongest possible terms the neo-Nazis and white supremacists who came to Charlottesville to demonstrate for hatred, resulting in violence and the loss of innocent life. We urge the President of the United States to do the same.\n\n\"HIAS stands with the students, activists, citizens, and faith leaders in Charlottesville who put their lives on the line to stand against bigotry. Through our work for refugees and asylum seekers, HIAS will continue to strive for an America that is welcoming to all, regardless of race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or ethnicity.\"\n\nJewish Labor Committee\n\nThe Jewish Labor Committee joins with all people of good will in our outrage at the events in Charlottesville, Virginia, surrounding the so-called \"Unite the Right\" rally on August 12, 2017. There is no place in our society for bigotry, prejudice, racism, and anti-Semitism. This language and those people who espouse it must be condemned at every turn.\n\nOur heart goes out to the victims of the neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacists who marched shouting hateful slogans against African-Americans and Jews.\n\nThey must be condemned, and defeated, in the press, on the streets, in the classrooms, in the workplaces, and in the halls of government, from the highest levels in the White House to every town hall and union hall across the United States.\n\nRabbinical Council of America\n\nOn Aug. 13:\n\nThe Rabbinical Council of America, the leading organization of Orthodox rabbis in North America, strongly condemns the violence and bigotry displayed yesterday at the White supremacist, alt-right, neo-Nazi and pro-Confederate gathering in Charlottesville, VA, and mourns the deaths and injuries that resulted.\n\n\"We are appalled by wanton displays of violence and hatred that erupted in Charlottesville on Saturday,\" said Rabbi Elazar Muskin, president of the Rabbinical Council of America. \"We pray for the injured and express our condolences to the families of those who were killed. We join our voices with all those who embrace the best of our country's values of respect, tolerance and decency.\"\n\nOn Aug. 17:\n\nAn Open Letter to the Jewish Community of Charlottesville, VA:\n\nAs we usher in this Shabbat just one week after the violent and deadly racist and anti-Semitic events in your city, the members of the Rabbinical Council of America reach out to you in solidarity, support, and friendship. Elie Wiesel once said, \"Jews alone are vulnerable...but Jews must not be alone.\" Know that you are not alone.\n\nWhile you were on the front-line of ugly manifestations of hatred and bigotry that led to death, intimidation, and fear; while there were calls to burn down your synagogue; and while you were eyewitnesses to the worst expressions of intolerance in our society, we were all under attack. When you are threatened, we are all threatened. When you are hurt, we all hurt. Know that you are not alone.\n\nWe add our voices to yours in condemning these manifestations, supporting those in political and religious leadership denouncing them, and call on all leaders and people of good will and faith to name and reject unequivocally and without qualification the views and actions of White Supremacists, neo-Nazis, the alt-right, and their supporters. We mourn with you the victims of this domestic terrorism: Heather Heyer, Lt. H. Jay Cullen, and trooper-pilot Berke M.M. Bates.\n\nIn fighting these prejudices we must learn an important lesson from the Jewish Shabbat herself:\n\nShabbat begins with the recitation of Kiddush, the blessing which sanctifies the holy day, and ends with Havdalah, the blessing which distinguishes the holy day that has passed from the weekday ahead. In both cases we are asked to make distinctions, distinctions between the holy and the profane, between light and darkness, and, ultimately, between good and evil. As the beauty and restfulness of this Shabbat descends on your community, we are all asked to raise our voices to distinguish between good and evil, and in so doing make our country more holy, more peaceful, and more godly for all of its people.\n\nShabbat Shalom.\n\nRabbi Elazar Muskin, president\n\nRabbi Mark Dratch, executive vice president\n\nUnion for Reform Judaism\n\nRabbi Rick Jacobs, the president of the Union for Reform Judaism, issued this statement in response to the deadly violence at the white supremacist hate march in Charlottesville, VA:\n\nThe vile presence and rhetoric of the neo-Nazis who marched this weekend in Charlottesville is a reminder of the ever-present need for people of good will to stand strong, to speak loudly against hate, and act both to delegitimize those who spread such messages and to mitigate the harm done to the commonweal of our nation and to those that are the targets of hate messages.\n\nRacist, anti-Semitic, and xenophobic views have no place in a society that cherishes freedom and liberty for all. The right to speak and to hold repugnant views is not a right to circumscribe the ability of others to live in peace and security. Torch-lit marches of hate evoke the KKK; the image of a heavily armed \"militia\" standing among the neo-Nazi protestors should send an alarm to every person of good conscience in our nation.\n\nOnce again hate has killed; we mourn the loss of life and those injured in the violence. We call on all, no matter what their views, to eschew violence and condemn in the strongest terms the car attack that killed and injured protestors.\n\nWe commend the opening of President Trump's statement condemning the \"egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence\" but are deeply troubled by the moral equivalence evident in President Trump's statement today. White supremacists wielding Nazi flags and spewing racist vitriol need to be specifically condemned, not only violence and hate \"on many sides.\" If our leaders can't call out this virulent strand of hate we will surely fail to stop it.\n\nAs we bid farewell to the Sabbath, we pray that the week to come will be filled with calm and safety, and that those who have committed crimes will be brought to justice.\n\nConservative Movement\n\nIn the aftermath of violent demonstrations by white supremacists and their sympathizers in Charlottesville, Virginia, resulting in 3 deaths and many injuries, the Rabbinical Assembly and the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism issued the following statement:\n\nThe Rabbinical Assembly and United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism are shocked and horrified by the violent demonstrations of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and their sympathizers in Charlottesville, Virginia this past Saturday which resulted directly in the deaths of one civilian and two state police officers and in many other serious injuries. We applaud the swift and effective actions of Mayor Mike Signer of Charlottesville and Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, as well as their appropriate condemnations of the bigotry, antisemitism and hatred that inspired the rally itself. Many leaders have taken the indispensable step of naming the dangerous philosophies and movements that united these demonstrators. These events have been rightly labeled as incidents of domestic terror by both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nWe call upon United States officials including President Donald Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to condemn neo-Nazi, white supremacist and alt-right movements by name. The repeated failure to do so by top U.S. officials has fueled their growth and poses an imminent threat to all Americans as Saturday's violent rallies showed. History has demonstrated that where a country's leaders fail to condemn these philosophies, violence and hatred can quickly and exponentially consume the fabric of civil society. Our leaders must act now. Let us continue to pray for and to work for the day when all shall \"sit under his/her vine and fig tree and none shall make them afraid.\"\n\nRabbi Philip Scheim, president, the Rabbinical Assembly\n\nRabbi Julie Schonfeld, CEO, the Rabbinical Assembly\n\nMargo Gold, president, United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism\n\nRabbi Steven Wernick, CEO, USCJ\n\nBend the Arc\n\nFollowing the violence and protests in Charlottesville, VA, including the death of one person after a car drove into a crowd, Bend the Arc Jewish Action Chief Strategy Officer Jonathan Lipman released the following statement:\n\n\"We are deeply saddened by the tragic events of the protests in Charlottesville today and our sympathies go out to the families of those injured and killed. The events of the last two days are the inevitable result of the bigotry and hatred that Donald Trump has been championing since he began his campaign.\n\n\"This is what it looks like for the President of the United States to support white nationalism. He has brought in white nationalists like Steve Bannon, Sebastian Gorka and Stephen Miller to serve at the highest levels of his administration. He has openly called for violence at his rallies, encouraged police to rough up suspects, and claimed that unauthorized immigrants were subhuman and not to be treated kindly. And he has still failed to acknowledge and commit to ending the increase in hate crimes that began with his election. This unmistakable pattern of the president's support for and endorsement of white nationalism, combined with his outrageous failure to explicitly and forcefully condemn the white supremacists and neo-Nazis responsible for today's violence, make his calls for unity disingenuous.\n\n\"American Jews recognize these dangerous and escalating patterns. We've seen this before. This hatred must stop. And the way Trump and his Administration can help stop it is through actions, not only words. If he truly believes we must love and respect one another, he must fire the white nationalists in his office. He must renounce the use of violence against any human being. And he must forcefully condemn people like David Duke, who said today's events were the fulfillment of the president's campaign promises. Failure to take these steps will be further evidence that he has chosen to align himself with white supremacy and against the safety and values of the American people. Those in his Administration who remain silent are also complicit.\"\n\n30 Years After\n\n30 Years After is appalled by this weekend's display of violence, racism and anti-Semitism at the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. We join the chorus of voices across the United States in speaking out against the senseless hatred of neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and the Ku Klux Klan. This rally crossed the line from repugnant speech protected by our cherished Constitution, to bigoted slogans and libels that incited violence.\n\nAs Jews and as Iranians, we have experienced firsthand Edmund Burke's truism: \"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing.\" Today, we embrace our freedoms and responsibilities as Americans to not stand idly by and call on our community to do the same. The best ideals of our tradition also compel us to honor the memories of Heather Heyer, Lt. H. Jay Cullen, and Trooper Pilot Berke M.M. Bates, who tragically perished in the mayhem of this past weekend.\n\nWe demand that President Trump and all elected leaders denounce any moral equivalence between the bigots and those who stood against them, and to take swift action to re-affirm our nation's commitment to tolerance, pluralism, and democracy.\n\nWorld Jewish Congress\n\nWorld Jewish Congress President Ronald S. Lauder on Saturday harshly condemned the violent Neo-Nazi demonstrations in Charlottesville, Va., that left dozens wounded and one dead.\n\n\"The World Jewish Congress unequivocally condemns the inconceivable violence exhibited at the neo-Nazi demonstration today in Charlottesville. Our prayers are with the victims of this violence and their families.\n\n\"It is utterly distressing and repugnant that such hatred and bigotry still run rampant in parts of this country. There is no place in our democratic society for such violence and intolerance. We must be vigilant and united in our opposition to such abhorrence.\n\n\"We commend the Charlottesville authorities and local government for their quick action in quelling these protests and restoring calm, and sincerely hope that this will serve as a deterrent for future demonstrations of violence.\"\n\nInternational March of the Living\n\nThe International March of the Living strongly condemns the vicious acts and words of antisemitism, Hitler-glorification and racism which took place in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nAmerica, the Land of the Free, must not tolerate acts of hatred, intolerance and bigotry of any kind or nature.\n\nThe International March of the Living is dedicated to teaching the lessons of the Holocaust and is committed to educating its participants on the need to stand against social injustice and acts of antisemitism whenever and wherever they occur.\n\nPhyllis Greenberg Heideman, president\n\nShmuel Rosenman, chairman\n\nCRIF\n\nFrancis Kalifat, the president of the Counseil Representatif des Institutions Juives de France, sent the following letter to Council of Presidents Executive Vice Chairman Malcom Hoenlein:\n\nAfter the difficult events which happened in Charlottesville, I am writing to express my support and solidarity, and that of the French Jewish community, to you to the Jews of the United States of America.\n\nThe vision of Nazi flags, the very symbol of anti-Semitism, flowing freely in your country, which has been the symbol of Democracy and to the fight against Nazism, is just unconceivable and inacceptable.\n\nWe have seen a resurgence of anti-Semitism all over the world over the past few years, especially in France and Europe. In face of such evil, you have always shown concern and solidarity. It is now my turn to reciprocate.\n\nAs always, we will stand together as one People with one Heart.\n\nTogether, we will face these challenges and together, we will combat anti-Semitism in our democracies, in our streets and on Internet.\n\nWe stand with you to combat the hate of Jews wherever it spreads, and express to our political representatives, our determination to eradicate anti-Semitism and hate from our democratic societies.\n\nJewish Agency\n\nThe chairman of the Executive of the Jewish Agency for Israel, Natan Sharansky, has issued the following statement:\n\n\"I am deeply concerned by the expressions of antisemitism and other forms of racism and hatred exhibited at the neo-Nazi rally this past weekend in Charlottesville, and I am horrified by the death of a protester at the hands of one of the marchers. These is no place for such hate speech or violence in any democratic society, and I am confident that American authorities will do everything in their power to bring the perpetrators to justice. No student, Jewish or otherwise, should feel threatened at his or her university, and Jewish students at the University of Virginia should know that the local Hillel staff is available to them at all times, as is the Jewish Agency Israel Fellow at UVA.\"\n\nIsraeli President Reuven Rivlin\n\nPresident Reuven Rivlin this evening (Wednesday), sent a letter to Executive Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, Mr. Malcolm Hoenlein, asking him to convey his support and solidarity for the American Jewish community.\n\nThe president wrote, \"At this difficult time I want to express my support and solidarity, and that of all the Israeli people, with you and your communities, and ask that you kindly convey this message on my behalf to the Jewish communities across the U.S.\"\n\nHe noted: \"The very idea that in our time we would see a Nazi flag - perhaps the most vicious symbol of anti-Semitism - paraded in the streets of the world's greatest democracy, and Israel's most cherished and greatest ally is almost beyond belief.\n\n\"We have seen manifestations of anti-Semitism again and again arise across the world; in Europe and the Middle East. In the face of such evil, we stand now as we did then. With faith. With faith in humanity, with faith in democracy, and with faith in justice. I know that the great nation of the United States of America and its leaders will know how to face this difficult challenge, and prove to the world the robustness and strength of democracy and freedom.\"\n\nRivlin concluded, \"As we say Chazak, Chazak, ve'Nitchazek. Be strong, be strong, and we will be strong.\"", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}}, "uri":

Police officers stand guard outside of synagogues. Recently, when I stayed in the Jewish Quarter in Rome, I couldn't help notice the presence of multiple police kiosks, each manned by an armed cop. Many Jews in European cities have long since ceased wearing yarmulkes or Stars of David. Jewish kids are instructed by their parents to avoid identifying themselves as Jews at school lest they be beaten up by their little Muslim friends.\n\nMeanwhile, almost everyone in a position to do something is a coward. Politicians continue to recite the mantra that \"Muslims are today's Jews,\" even though in Europe today Muslims are far more often the tormentors than the tormented, and Jews lead the list of victims of public abuse. Police prefer not to prosecute Muslim perpetrators for fear of being called \"Islamophobes.\" Teachers don't want to deal with Muslim bullies in their classes for the same reason.\n\nYet you would hardly know this to read much of America's Jewish media. On August 2, the Jewish Journal ran a piece slamming Trump adviser Stephen Miller for dismissing (quite properly) the suggestion by CNN's Jim Acosta that the new immigration bill favoring English-speakers violated the \"spirit\" of Emma Lazarus's Statue of Liberty poem, \"The New Colossus,\" and emphasizing, as if it had anything to do with the issue, that Miller himself is the great-grandson of Jewish immigrants. This was not the first time the Jewish Journal had gone after Miller for being a Jew who supports immigration reform. In March, another piece in that publication, headlined (I kid you not) \"From Hebrew School to Halls of Power,\" noted that Miller was \"a principal author of Trump's draconian immigration measures, including the executive order the president signed in late January targeting immigrants from Muslim-majority countries,\" even though \"[t]hese politics are generally reviled in the liberal circles of his Jewish upbringing.\"\n\nThe big hit-job, however, came a year ago, when the editor-in-chief of the Jewish Journal, Rob Eshman, sneered at Miller for the way in which he \"froth[ed] the mob\" at Trump rallies over immigration. Eshman professed shock at the news that Miller is Jewish. How, he asked, could \"this young anti-immigrant leader\" be \"the descendent of immigrants\"? Eshman looked into Miller's family tree, and discovered that his maternal great-grandfather, seeking to escape persecution by Cossacks, fled Antopol (in present-day Belarus) and settled in Pennsylvania, where he founded a thriving business. And yet, thundered Eshman, Miller dares to serve as \"Trump's anti-immigrant avatar.\" Imagine: \"The great-grandson of a desperate refugee can grow up to shill for the demagogue bent on keeping desperate refugees like his great-grandfather out.\"\n\nNeedless to say, the immigrants Trump wants to keep out of the U.S. are precisely the type who, in Europe, are currently Jew-bashing people like Stephen Miller -- and Rob Eshman. But Eshman doesn't want to think about this ticklish fact, which challenges his own simplistic, self-righteous pontifications. No, better to demonize Miller as \"an American Jew [who has] turn[ed] on immigrants,\" who has \"tak[en] the side of people who... would have met your own great-grandparents at the docks with stones and spitballs,\" and who is \"stoking anti-immigrant fear and hate, by calling for a ban on an entire religion.\"\n\nAs it happens, Trump has never sought to enact a ban on an entire religion, although the present situation in Europe certainly makes a good argument for such a ban (with ample room for sensible exceptions, of course).\n\nOn August 3, over at the Forward, formerly the Jewish Daily Forward, one Steven Davidson actually served up one of the most idiotic articles of the year, entitled \"19 People Jews Should Worry About More Than Linda Sarsour.\" Sarsour, of course, is the devout, hijab-wearing, sharia-loving, Israel-boycotting Muslim who, since her high-profile appearance at the Women's March on the day after Trump's inauguration, has become a hero of feminism and of the left generally. Linda Sarsour is the very personification of stealth Islamization and an obvious anti-Semite. But as Davidson himself noted, she's acquired plenty of Jewish allies and defenders, \"including Jeremy Ben-Ami, Mark Hetfield, Rabbi Jill Jacobs and Brad Lander.\"\n\nAs for Davidson, while finding some of her language \"coarse and insensitive,\" he insists that criticism of her has \"no basis in reality.\" In his piece, he encouraged readers to move from Sarsour and focus their concerns instead on 19 other people, including Louis Farrakhan, David Duke, the Ayatollah Khamenei, and the leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah. Well, I don't know about you, but I'm capable of hating all these other people while still having enough hate left for Linda Sarsour. (I'm also capable of noticing that nobody in the American mainstream is celebrating most of these other creeps, while Sarsour, under a Hillary Clinton administration, would probably have been in line for a Presidential Medal of Freedom.)\n\nAlso on the list, however, are White House counter-terrorism adviser Sebastian Gorka, whom Davidson smears as \"a member of a far-right group founded by Nazis\"; Trump strategist Steve Bannon, formerly of Breitbart, which \"spew[s] xenophobic hate\"; Milo Yiannopoulos, who although half-Jewish \"disseminat[es] Jewish conspiratorial tropes\"; and President Trump himself, whose crimes against the Jewish people, according to Davidson, include \"[r]efus[al] to mention Jews on Holocaust Remembrance Day.\" Never mind that he has a Jewish daughter and grandchildren; we are supposed to believe that it is Trump, not Sarsour, who threatens Jews. Perhaps Davidson should have a little chat with some of the growing number of European Jews who are heading straight to Trump's America to escape Sarsour's coreligionists who, in countries run by politicians of whom Davidson doubtless approves, are being allowed to turn Europe once again into a place from which Jews feel compelled to flee.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri":

But for those of us who spend time listening to American middle and high school students, it was no surprise at all.\n\nI have seen anti-Jewish bias in American schools for 25 years, first when I directed a statewide unit in the Maine attorney general's office, working with local and state police to obtain restraining orders against people who engaged in bias-motivated violence and threats, and later in my ongoing work to reduce bias-motivated bullying and harassment in schools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I work with schools on anti-bias strategies, I begin by doing focus groups with students, something I've now done in dozens of schools across the United States. In most schools, I have seen high levels of degrading language about people of color, immigrants, girls, LGBTQ students, Muslims, and Jews.\n\nAnti-Jewish bias in schools, which seems to have increased over the past decade, focuses on two themes. One is traditional stereotypes about Jews, including about their physical appearance (large noses and curly hair) and about their supposed obsession with money. I have heard many accounts of students throwing pennies or quarters in front of Jewish students.\n\nGet This Week in Opinion in your inbox: Globe Opinion's must-reads, delivered to you every Sunday.

Students tell me that graffiti about the Holocaust are widespread: Swastikas etched into desks, scrawled on walls, written on notebooks. And there's a seemingly endless array of \"jokes\" about that genocide. \"How many Jews can you fit in a car? Two in the back seat, two in the front seat -- and a million in the ash tray.\" \"What is the difference between a Boy Scout and a Jew? The Boy Scout comes back from camp.\"\n\nSitting with high school and middle school students, I hear of widespread use of negative words, comments, and stereotypes about Jews occurring both in schools where most students know many Jewish students, and also in schools where most students do not think they ever have met a Jew, whether in or outside school. The schools include suburban schools close to larger eastern cities, small cities from the northwest, and New England towns.\n\nIn addition to my deep concern for the well-being of Jewish students, I worry about the impact of anti-Semitic language and conduct on non-Jewish students who know very little about Jews and Judaism, and may not even know a Jewish person. I worry that years of hearing degrading language and stereotypes about Jews will infect them with bias. How will they react as adults if anti-Semitism rises significantly across the United States? Will they join the anti-Semites? Will they stay quiet, thinking that those stereotypes may be accurate?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI never thought I would see a US president fail to condemn outrageously racist and anti-Semitic words and violence forcefully and immediately. The message that the supremacist movement received from the president's extraordinarily weak response was empowering. But I also worry that his initial failure to clearly and unambiguously address anti-Semitism and racism sends a message to students that their jokes, their slurs, their swastikas, and their thrown pennies are acceptable. It is hard to conceive of a response from the president that could be more irresponsible and dismaying.\n\nSteve Wessler is a consultant who designs anti-bias and anti-harassment programs for schools in the United States and Europe.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100, "id": 253, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/International", "wgt": 100, "id": 556, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/International"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "wgt": 100, "id": 705, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/K_through_12", "wgt": 100, "id": 1062, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/K through 12"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Special_Education", "wgt": 100, "id": 1137, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Special Education"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "200134"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "type": "loc", "id": "210152"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302532", "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302578", "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "302940", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303047", "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303629", "label": {"eng": "Muslim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "304262", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304451", "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304554", "label": {"eng": "Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305042", "label": {"eng": "Language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305518", "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306081", "label": {"eng": "Stereotype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309397", "label": {"eng": "New England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309505", "label": {"eng": "Middle school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309983", "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "310713", "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "311203", "label": {"eng": "Adolf Hitler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311925", "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "312441", "label": {"eng": "Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314901", "label": {"eng": "Graffiti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "314994", "label": {"eng": "Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "321280", "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}]}

But He's Right About Israel", "uri": "711140796", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-17T22:18:00Z", "time": "22:18:00", "body": "The images of Nazis and white supremacists marching in the streets of Charlottesville with torches chanting \"blood and soil\" shook me to my core. But so did something else that happened this week. In the aftermath of these acts of blatant racism and anti-Semitism, one of the march's leaders, Richard Spencer, was invited onto Israeli TV. His words were chilling, but not for the reason I expected.\n\nThe Israeli TV host asked Spencer how he, a Jew, should feel about Spencer's platform. What Spencer said was shocking:\n\n\"As an Israeli citizen, someone who understands your identity, who has a sense of nationhood and peoplehood and history and experience of the Jewish people, you should respect someone like me,\" Spencer said. \"I care about my people. I want us to have a secure homeland for us and ourselves, just like you want a secure homeland in Israel.\" He told the Israeli host that he sees himself as \"a white Zionist.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Spencer has compared his disturbing white nationalist vision to the Zionist project. A few months ago, Spencer stunned a rabbi at an event in Texas when he said: \"Do you really want radical inclusion into the State of Israel? And by that I mean radical inclusion. Maybe all of the Middle East could go move into Tel Aviv or Jerusalem. Would you really want that?\"\n\nThe rabbi didn't have an answer and he's not the only one. This is what's so chilling about Spencer's comparison of white supremacy to Israel - not its anti-Semitism but the kernel of truth at its core. Richard Spencer, whose racist views are rightfully abhorred by the majority of the Jewish community, is holding a mirror up to Zionism and the reflection isn't pretty.\n\nNow, of course, the comparison is not literally true. For starters, we Jews have a recent history in which we really could have used a country willing to stand up for us. That's the historical rationale for establishing a Jewish state and that distinguishes us fundamentally from white nationalists. White nationalists in the U.S. are not facing any kind of discrimination whatsoever, despite their belief that they are.\n\nBut still, there are ways in which Spencer's description of Israel hits a little too close to home.\n\nLooking at Israel today, we can see a state premised on the privileging of one group, and all too often perpetuating the erasure and displacement of another. We also see an obsession with demographics and the maintenance of an ethnic majority.\n\nThen you have the demolition of Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem, the state sanctioning of Jewish settlers who seize Palestinian homes in Hebron, and the policy of seizing the property of \"present absentees\" after Palestinians were displaced during the war to establish the state of Israel are just some examples.\n\nThen there's the discrimination faced by Palestinian citizens of Israel (who should ostensibly have the same rights as Jewish Israelis), Mizrahi and Ethiopian Jews, and African refugees seeking asylum.\n\nMany of us see these policies as alarming violations of human and civil rights, indeed, of our Jewish values. And the proof is in the pudding: Richard Spencer sees this as inspiration for his white nationalist vision.\n\nBut we don't have to rely on Richard Spencer to tell us that there are other disturbing places of intersection. There is a disturbing alliance between Zionists and white nationalists in the White House these days, and it doesn't come from nowhere. There is a shared bedrock of anxiety about demographics and racist and Islamophobic fear of \"Arabs\" that goes hand in hand with both worldviews.\n\nAnd just like there are fascists marching the streets of America, there are fascists marching the streets of Israel beating up leftists. The alt-right are not the only ones being vile online, either. My friends report that they regularly receive death threats as a consequence of their activism. During the Israeli assault on Gaza in the summer of 2014, leftist Israeli friends who opposed the war reported being chased by fascist mobs on the streets of Jerusalem.\n\nEven ex-prime minister Ehud Barak said this week that the events in Charlottesville reminded him of fascism in Israel. He cited the example of Lehava, an anti-miscegenation gang that frequently attacks Palestinians.\n\nLet's not let Richard Spencer be our mirror. Let's work instead to challenge ethnic supremacy and right-wing violence, both here and in Israel.\n\nThat means taking active steps to oppose Israel's occupation, working for human and civil rights in Israel, and joining the movement for racial justice in the U.S. as full partners, and challenging the ways our own institutions uphold discrimination.\n\nFor too long, Jewish institutions have focused on branding advocates for Palestinian rights, and critics of the state of Israel and Zionism itself, as anti-Semitic - to the detriment of the fights against both antisemitism and racism. The reactionary response from Jewish institutions to the Movement for Black Lives platform is a prime example of how this misguided reaction to criticism of Israel has prevented American Jewish communities from working alongside Black organizers to challenge both anti-Jewish oppression and systematic anti-Black racism.\n\nThe most promising solution to anti-Semitism lies in building relationships and coalitions, recognizing how our freedoms are bound up together with those of people who have fewer rights than us, and having those difficult conversations when conflicts arise. It requires challenging the institutions that uphold supremacy, together.\n\nThat is the work, and that will, at times, require us to hold up that mirror to ourselves and to our communities. Let's do it together.\n\nNaomi Dann is media manager at Jewish Voice for Peace.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "wgt": 100, "id": 705, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100, "id": 885, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100, "id": 1181, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}, "type": "loc", "id": "102"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "type": "loc", "id": "8282"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hebron"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebron", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hebron"}, "type": "loc", "id": "8521"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "type": "loc", "id": "8933"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Jerusalem", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "type": "loc", "id": "292509"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302813", "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302940", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303042", "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303327", "label": {"eng": "Ethnic group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303471", "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304554", "label": {"eng": "Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305969", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306436", "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308371", "label": {"eng": "Fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309890", "label": {"eng": "Arab people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "309896", "label": {"eng": "Palestinian people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "310713", "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "313196", "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "314998", "label": {"eng": "Rabbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehud_Barak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "315663", "label": {"eng": "Ehud Barak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "315665", "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "315666", "label": {"eng": "Israeli Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "315670", "label": {"eng": "Israelis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "315896", "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "318684", "label": {"eng": "American Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "326979", "label": {"eng": "Israeli settlement"}}]}

Klein's; ornate synagogues and humbler street-corner shuls marking the movement of Newark's Jews from the Canal Street area to the Central Ward to the leafy neighborhoods of Clinton Hill and Weequahic; bakeries, candy stores and luncheonettes all along Bergen Street and Chancellor Avenue; local fixtures like Beth Israel Hospital, the Newark Museum, the Newark Public Library and the YMHA - all first rate and all contributing a cosmopolitan ambience to a city that, in terms of sheer physical size, was actually rather small.\n\nBut even in Jewish Newark's heyday, a golden age that would stretch, roughly, from the late 1920s to the mid-1950s, social and political forces - the decline of the city's once thriving banking, insurance and smokestack industries; the movement of upwardly mobile Jews to suburbia; the steady growth of a black underclass - were at work that would, in time, spell catastrophe.\n\n* * * * *\n\nNewark's first Jews were Sephardim, but they were few and unorganized. It wasn't until the 1840s, and the first stages of the mass immigration of German Jews to America, that a definable Jewish presence established itself in Newark, a city in the midst of rapid change.\n\nThe former backwater of dirt roads and family farms was fast becoming a center of industry and commerce; in 1870 the city's population stood at better than 100,000 and two years later an estimated 130,000 visitors attended the Newark Industrial Exposition.\n\nJews from Eastern Europe began arriving in the U.S. in the 1880s. In Newark, as in New York City, there were important religious and cultural differences between the newcomers and the already-settled German Jews, who in many respects seemed more comfortable with their non-Jewish German neighbors than with their brethren from Russia and Poland.\n\n\"In Newark,\" writes Helmreich, \"the relationships between [Eastern European and German Jews] were even more tense than elsewhere because Newark was small enough for people to know each other. For example, the German-Jewish and East European synagogues were located within walking distance of each other. Newark was small enough for youngsters to know which summer camps were for German Jews and which were not, just as their parents knew which country clubs accepted Eastern Europeans and which did not.\"\n\nThe prejudice against Eastern Europeans first showed signs of weakening during the 1920s. By the 1940s, with the Holocaust raging in Europe, it would be reduced to a negligible aspect of Jewish life in Newark, though even then it would not be entirely eradicated.\n\nMeanwhile, the Jewish population of Newark had already topped 45,000 by the mid-1920s - more than half that number of Eastern European background. The 1920s were notable in other ways as well: the Conference of Jewish Charities was formed in 1923, giving Newark's Jews a central communal organization and Newark Beth Israel Hospital, which had been founded in 1901, moved in 1929 to its permanent Lyons Avenue location. (Little-known fact: Paula Ben-Gurion, wife of Israel's first prime minister, was a trainee at Beth Israel's school of nursing).\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe growth of Newark Jewry's influence and prestige continued unabated over the next couple of decades - the city elected its first (and only) Jewish mayor, Meyer \"Doc\" Ellenstein, in 1932 - and reached full bloom in the 1940s.\n\nWith about 60,000 Jews (or about 12 percent of the city's total population) living in Newark proper, and thousands more in Greater Newark - the nearby towns of Irvington, Hillside, Maplewood, the Oranges, Bloomfield, Millburn and Verona - the community appeared set for continued growth and success.\n\nIndeed, as Rutgers history professor Clement Alexander Price observes in a 1994 paper for the Jewish Historical Society of MetroWest, \"despite its pockets of poverty and the divisions between the Orthodox and Reform and political conservatives and radicals, Newark's Jewish community became by the end of World War II one of the city's most vibrant entities. It was, in short, emblematic of the ethnic success story.\"\n\nBy the end of World War II, Newark's Jews, having emerged unscathed from sporadic confrontations with local Nazis and Nazi sympathizers found among the large German population of Newark and next-door Irvington - a little-remembered tale told with flair by Warren Grover in Nazis in Newark (Transaction, 2003) - were more confident than ever, more secure in their status as Americans, more comfortable than they probably ever expected to be.\n\nThe center of Jewish gravity at mid-century was the city's Weequahic section, made famous by native son Philip Roth, whose body of work reflects an ambivalence about Judaism and Jewish identity but none about the singular experience of growing up Jewish in Newark. (Roth was one of many prominent American Jews born and/or raised in Newark; some others were Fanny Brice, Ed Koch, Jerry Lewis and Dore Schary.)\n\nRoth's conflicted feelings about religion and ethnicity were typical of a generation of American Jews squarely on the fast track to secularization and assimilation. Even so, Newark's Jewish community had a rich religious tradition going back to the city's first three synagogues - B'nai Jeshurun (founded in 1848), B'nai Abraham (1855) and Oheb Shalom (1860). All three started out as traditional or Orthodox congregations but each eventually fell away from strict observance.\n\nOver the years Newark was home to a surprisingly large number of prominent rabbis from the three major denominations. (By 1948 there were at least 40 synagogues in the city.) The most widely recognized Reform leader, certainly on a national scale, was Joachim Prinz, who arrived at B'nai Abraham from Germany in 1939 and became a major figure in Jewish organizational life and the civil rights movement.\n\nThe Orthodox community was well represented by rabbis such as Hyman Brodsky (his synagogue, Congregation Anshei Russia, was one of Newark's most important); Joseph Konvitz (Brodsky's successor); Chaim Glatzer; Mordechai Ehrenkrantz; Jacob Mendelson; Elias Singer; David Singer; Israel Turner; Herman Kahn; Zundel Levine; Louis Weller; Meyer Blumenfeld; the Pittsburgher Rebbe, Avrohom Abba Leifer; Oscar Kline; Zev Segal; Moshe Kasinetz; and Sholom Ber Gordon (a major influence on a young Newark resident who decades later would go on to help make ArtScroll an enormous success story - Rabbi Nosson Scherman).\n\nNewark's Orthodox community was a lenient one, Helmreich told this writer in an interview about the book.\n\n\"In fact,\" he explained, \"Newark offers us a very clear understanding of a typical mid-20th century American Orthodox community. What makes it particularly unique is that when American Orthodoxy began its steadily rightward drift, Jewish Newark was already in its decline. And by the time the new, stricter climate had become the norm even in Modern Orthodox circles, Newark's Jewish community had, for all intents and purposes, passed from the scene.\"\n\nThe result is that scholars and researchers can look at Newark's Orthodox community as a specimen frozen in time - a community that ceased to exist before it had the chance to change in the manner of other similar communities.\n\n\"It was a more tolerant Orthodoxy,\" Helmreich said. \"The rabbis were willing to work with non-Orthodox leaders for the greater good of the community. There was a greater acceptance of differences. People didn't march in lockstep - there were disagreements even on such matters as day-school education.\"\n\nHelmreich notes in his book that in 1932 a Reform rabbi, Marius Ranson, was invited to address the Yong Israel Sisterhood. \"Not only was Ranson Reform,\" writes Helmreich, \"but he was in the left wing of his movement. People were not permitted to wear a yarmulke or tallis in his temple. Imagine a Young Israel synagogue today tendering an invitation to such a rabbi!\"\n\nCiting yet another example of changing times, Helmreich told me that \"as unbelievable as it may sound today, there were Orthodox rabbis back in the 1940s who opposed the formation of what became Newark's most successful day school, Hebrew Youth Academy.\n\n\"It was a totally different climate and an almost unrecognizable mindset.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe end of Jewish Newark is described by Helmreich in all its sad detail. He makes a point of stressing that, in a larger sense, Jewish Newark had begun its inexorable decline decades before, with a steady stream of Jews slowly making their way out of the city and into the surrounding suburbs.\n\nBut it was the escalating tensions between Jews and blacks that added a sense of urgency to Jewish flight. Helmreich is remarkably fair in apportioning blame for the demise of the Jewish community and doesn't hesitate to address such uncomfortable questions as Jewish racism on the one hand and the acquiescence of Jews in the takeover of their neighborhoods on the other.\n\nThe racism touched on by Helmreich may come as something of an unpleasant surprise to some - the American Jewish community, in Newark and elsewhere, was famous for its support of liberalism and civil rights - but it was a painful reality and hardly exclusive to Newark's Jews. Neighborhoods across the country were witness to the seemingly anomalous spectacle of liberal Jews fleeing their homes and neighborhoods at the first sighting of black newcomers - while presumably more conservative blue-collar white ethnics stayed put.\n\nThe journalist Max Geltman, in The Confrontation: Black Power, Anti-Semitism, and the Myth of Integration (Prentice-Hall, 1970) describes the good Jewish liberals of Newark who \"mourned the dead in Mississippi, the wounded in Alabama, the uneducated in Little Rock, and every slight to a Negro anywhere outside New Jersey. But in Newark things were different . It was almost three months after I had moved there before I realized that my neighbors always said 'they' when they meant Negroes. My daughter heard the word schwartze for the first time in her life - from friends whose parents were members of the A.D.L. and solid supporters of integration in the South.\"\n\nThere was a time when black-Jewish relations in Newark held at least a semblance of promise. \"Blacks and Jews,\" writes Professor Price, \"were among the most prominent of the groups who came to Newark to escape terrible circumstances. Both groups found that the city's racial and ethnic relations were benign when compared to many other cities. There were no race riots or other dramatic forms of racial/ethnic confrontations that would stem the tide of blacks and Jews seeking some semblance of a Promised Land.\"\n\nBut that relatively idyllic state of affairs could not survive the contrasting fortunes of an upwardly mobile Jewish community and a black populace struggling, mostly unsuccessfully, to overcome poverty, prejudice and a series of ill-advised government policies.\n\n\"The decline of Newark,\" adds Price, \"was a part of the general decline of old American cities in the twentieth century . As the old cities decayed, they were surrounded by a glittering array of shopping malls, corporate parks and residential communities whose newness seemingly underscored the inferiority of urban life . Although many old cities experienced much the same decline after World War II, few rivaled the losses which Newark sustained in population, vitality, and prestige.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe riots of July 1967 served as the coffin nails for a Jewish community that had for all intents and purposes died years before. The weeklong explosion of violence, aimed in significant part at Jewish merchants (Geltman describes rioters \"shouting 'get Goldberg!' as they ravaged business establishments without care whether anyone was in them or not\") destroyed the hopes of the few optimists who had dared hold out hope for the city's remaining Jews.\n\nMost of those Jews departed within the next few years, and by the mid-1970s there were few tangible signs left of Newark's glorious Jewish past.\n\nNo matter how great a revival Newark may yet experience, writes Helmreich, \"it will bear little resemblance to the Newark that its Jewish population identified with. After all, B'nai Jeshurun [became] the Hopewell Baptist Church, Anshei Russia [became] home to the Abyssinian Baptist Church, and the Y that was a second home for thousands of Jews became, for a time, the abode of the Citadel of Hope Miracle Temple, now defunct.\"\n\nFor Jews, Newark today is little more than a graveyard, figuratively and literally: The city is home to at most a few hundred Jewish residents and nearly 100 Jewish cemeteries. In the end, there may be no epitaph for Newark more moving or appropriate than that offered by journalism professor Jeffrey Brody, whose observations on the destruction wrought by the rioters of '67

Hundreds of white nationalists, alt-righters, neo-Nazis and members of the KKK descended on the Virginia city to participate in the \"Unite the Right\" rally. Rally-goer James Alex Fields is accused of mowing down counter-demonstrators with his car, killing Heather Heyer, a 32-year old paralegal, and injuring many others.\n\nAnti-Semitism and other forms of racism were on display.\n\nFor decades, I've fought anti-Semitism. I was once asked why I dedicated my life to the cause. \"I was ashamed,\" I responded, \"because I could not defend one Jew -- my mother -- against an anti-Semite. God, in His mercy, gave me a nation of Jews to defend.\"\n\nMy mother came from an Orthodox Jewish background. She named me after her grandfather, Rabbi Mikel Katznelson who, along with 2,000 other Jews, were burned to death in their synagogue. She had been abused by a white supremacist and Jew-hater -- my own father. He choked me and left me for dead when I was 11 years old because I had tried to defend my mother. He believed I was not his son, but the product of an affair my mother had with a Jewish man.\n\nTo confront such evil, it helps to have inspiration from heroes who have done the same. That's why, in 1988, I purchased and restored the Corrie ten Boom house in Haarlem, Holland, and turned it into a Holocaust memorial. It's also why I built the Friends of Zion Heritage Center in Jerusalem.\n\nAnd it's why I have written many books and articles and traveled all over the world to speak and meet with leaders. In 1984, I worked with Prime Minister Menachem Begin to build support for Israel and to combat anti-Semitism. At that time, I wrote Israel: America's Key to Survival, and produced a television special by the same name.\n\nAnti-Semites took notice.\n\nOn June 30 of that year, a man named Richard Wayne Snell decided he would give me a birthday present. (Snell was a neo-Nazi and part of an organization called Covenant Sword and Arm of the Lord. He was executed the same day that Timothy McVeigh blew up the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.) His gift would be my death. The ATF informed me that Snell was heading toward my home and that he had murdered two people, including a black state trooper.\n\nThe only thing they found in his car besides weapons was a slip of paper on which was written my name, home address and unlisted phone number.\n\nThis new convulsion of anti-Semitism is mostly anti-Christian. But we Christians have a history of anti-Semitism as well. At the age of 4, I remember watching cartoons. At the end of the program, a Billy Graham crusade came on. My mother dashed over, snapped off the set, pointed a finger in my face and said, \"Never watch that again! Christians kill Jews; Christians hate Jews! Jesus died. Don't dig Him up. The pope, Billy Graham and Adolf Hitler are all Christians. You are named after my grandfather, who was burned to death by Christian Nazis.\" That is what my mother believed.\n\nHow heartbreaking! As I grew older, I pushed my mother's cart to the market and back home on Friday evenings. As we walked down the street, people threw eggs and tomatoes at us, screaming: \"Jew witch!\" The first time I was attacked, it was because they said I was a kike -- a contemptuous term for a Jewish person.\n\nHow could so many churches in Germany become powerless, and even display swastikas on their altars? Why is the history of Christianity blood-stained with attacks on Jews? The Holocaust is only the most recent and deadly. The evil does not begin with gas chambers. It ends there. It begins in the hearts and minds of ordinary people who don't speak out against evil such as we saw on display in Charlottesville.\n\nMother Teresa and I prayed together in Rome shortly before her death. As we prayed for the Jewish people, she said, \"You can't love Jesus without loving the Jewish people. Jesus was a Jew. Love is not something you say, it is something you do.\"\n\nReal Christians must speak up the very moment the demon of racism rears its ugly head. Otherwise, it's pure hypocrisy to say they love Jesus.\n\nOriginally published at The Stream.

Yes, they should have freedom of speech but not freedom from the consequences of their actions.\n\nThe murder of Heather Heyer, 32, an innocent counter-protester, when a white supremacist allegedly rammed into the crowd with his car, was terrorism.\n\nWhoever was responsible should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. If there were accomplices, they should be hunted down without mercy.\n\nBut do not tell me I must therefore side with the violent, left-wing yahoos who clashed with the white supremacists in Charlottesville.\n\nDo not pretend they were defending Jews, or the freedoms on which America was built.\n\nFor anyone who thinks the hard, violent left is a friend of the Jewish people, here's a fun little assignment.\n\nNext time, let yourself be surrounded by them during one of their riots -- anywhere in the world -- bring out an Israeli flag and start talking about what a great country Israel is.\n\nWatch what happens.\n\nSpare us the drivel, which the liberal chattering classes spout ad nauseam, and which provides intellectual cover for the hard, violent left, that you can criticize Israel without being a Jew hater.\n\nOf course you can criticize Israel, the occupation and its treatment of the Palestinians and not be a Jew hater.\n\nJews do it. Israelis do it. The respected Israeli newspaper Haaretz, does it. For gawd's sake, so do former heads of the Shin Bet, Israel's internal security service, the equivalent of the FBI, just as the foreign security service, the Mossad, is similar to the CIA.\n\nBut that's not how the hard, violent left constantly demonizes and delegitimizes the Jewish state of Israel, while turning a blind eye to greater human rights abuses all over the world, including, to compare apples to apples, in The Islamic Republic of Iran and The Islamic Republic of Pakistan.\n\nAs a wise rabbi once said, in the ancient world, where religion ruled, Jew haters portrayed Judaism as the worst religion, including the blood libel that Jews kill Christians to use their blood to make matzah.\n\nIn the twentieth century, when science ruled, the Nazis set out to prove by \"science\" that Jews were a uniquely evil race.\n\nIn our time, where human rights is the dominant paradigm, Jew haters portray Israel, the Jewish state, as the worst violator of human rights, like apartheid South Africa.\n\nGuess who the most vocal supporters of that view of Israel are today?\n\nThey didn't have to riot in Charlottesville.\n\nThey infect our universities and journalism and the chattering classes, and they get way more air time than the neo-Nazis.\n\nSo, side with the hard and violent left over the hard and violent right?

Jews are vastly overrepresented in what you could call 'the establishment,' that is, Ivy League educated people who really determine policy, and white people are being dispossessed from this country.\"\n\nJeff Sessions: The Charlottesville car attack could be a \"hate crime\"\n\nAsked how he thought Jewish people would respond to that statement, Spencer replied: \"...an Israeli citizen, someone who understands your identity, who has a sense of nationhood and peoplehood, and the history and experience of the Jewish people, you should respect someone like me, who has analogue feelings about whites.\n\n\"You could say that I am a white Zionist - in the sense that I care about my people, I want us to have a secure homeland for us and ourselves. Just like you want a secure homeland in Israel.\"\n\nDespite the seeming equivalence Spencer tried to draw between his own movement and the establishment of a Jewish state, the white nationalist has been criticised for anti-Semitic remarks in the past.\n\nAlt-right leader Richard Spencer punched in the face during inauguration protest\n\nOn Holocaust Remembrance Day last year, Spencer praised then US-President elect Donald Trump's statement, which neglected to mention the particular persecution of the Jewish people, as a successful \"de-Judification\" of the event.\n\nAccording to Haaretz, he has also previously said that Jewish people insist on making Holocaust remembrance \"all about their meta-narrative of suffering.\"\n\nMr Trump, of whom Spencer is a supporter, has caused international outrage for doubling-down on his position that \"both sides\" were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville, rather than the white supremacists.\n\nOn Monday, he told the Times of Israel that he was pleased with the president's refusal to condemn the so-called \"alt-right\" outright.\n\n\"I think in his gut he knows that we are not the ones aggressing,\" he said.\n\nMore about:

I said back then that when America becomes fascist, it would blame it on the Jews. Now that fascism is rising on both sides of the political map, instead of wising up, \"Many Jewish leaders,\" to quote commentator Isi Leibler, \"concentrate more on vilifying Trump than securing and promoting their communal interests. They unashamedly abuse their Jewish institutional roles to promote far-left and liberal agendas, even labeling their opponents antisemites to achieve their goals.\"\n\nJewish leaders and celebrities are racing one another to condemn President Trump for his initial reaction to the Charlottesville ramming. Instead of standing up for unity, they are fueling division. Actress Debra Messing quoted Holocaust survivor and activist Elie Wiesel: \"We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.\" So, speaking of taking sides, I would like to quote a comment that one of Leibler's readers posed: \"Where was all of this Jewish American outrage when that leftist shot up a bunch of softball playing Senators and Congressmen a couple of weeks ago?\"\n\n\"For they sow the wind, and they reap the whirlwind\" (Hosea, 8:7), the Torah warns. The more American Jews fuel the hatred, the more it will turn against them. If Jewish American leaders think that the way to tackle alt-right fascism is to defame the president, demonize his electorate, and delegitimize his administration, they have only themselves to blame when the anger turns against them. They are playing with fire.\n\nJudaism has never been about war, and certainly not about hatred. We pride ourselves in the wisdom of King Solomon, who said, \"Hate stirs strife, and love covers all crimes\" (Proverbs, 10:12). We coined the tenet, \"Love your neighbor as yourself,\" and our own Rabbi Akiva said that this is the whole of our Torah, our Jewish law. How can we call ourselves Jews as long as we exude such hatred?\n\nWe made unity above hatred our motto, our way of life, and now we are doing the exact opposite. The Mishnah tells us (Okatzin, 3:12): \"God did not find a vessel that holds a blessing for Israel but peace, as it was said, 'The Lord will give strength to His people; the Lord will bless His people with peace.'\" The book Shem Mishmuel writes that \"When Israel are 'as one man with one heart,' they are a fortified wall against the forces of evil.\" So why are we fighting hatred with hatred instead of uniting like our sages suggest? Does anyone really think that patronizing half the US population will diminish antisemitism? What kind of lame policy is this?\n\nThe only thing that Jews must focus on is unity among themselves. And by unity, I don't mean that they should unite their ranks against the president, but that they unite all factions of American Jewry: all the denominations, the non-affiliated, the intermarried, the LGBTQ, every single one. If Jews, who are always at the center of attention (and today more so than ever), show America that unity is possible, they will be a positive role model to follow, and everyone will thank the Jewish community for proving it.\n\nThe book Likutey Etzot (Assorted Counsels) specifies how we should relate to those with whom we disagree: \"The essence of peace is to connect two opposites. Hence, do not be alarmed if you see a person whose view is the complete opposite of yours and you think that you will never be able to make peace with him. Also, when you see two people who are completely opposite to one another, do not say that it is impossible to make peace between them. On the contrary, the essence of peace is to try to make peace above two opposites.\"\n\nIf American Jewry wants to create that \"fortified wall against the forces of evil,\" they must remove the walls they have erected toward their brethren. I'm not sure American Jewry has not missed the last train, but the approach of uniting the Jews above all the disagreements among them is the only approach that can save American Jewry from a catastrophe that is now vividly on the horizon.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100, "id": 253, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100, "id": 331, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "wgt": 100, "id": 705, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100, "id": 1181, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}, "type": "loc", "id": "102"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "200134"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302604", "label": {"eng": "Softball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302948", "label": {"eng": "Politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303042", "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303819", "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304554", "label": {"eng": "Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305377", "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306302", "label": {"eng": "Anger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306352", "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "308371", "label": {"eng": "Fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309000", "label": {"eng": "Evil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310713", "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "311925", "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "313302", "label": {"eng": "Solomon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314032", "label": {"eng": "Activism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "314994", "label": {"eng": "Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "318684", "label": {"eng": "American Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "319330", "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halakha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "340978", "label": {"eng": "Halakha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "341009", "label": {"eng": "Torah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Proverbs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "347315", "label": {"eng": "Book of Proverbs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elie_Wiesel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "357177", "label": {"eng": "Elie Wiesel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh'erit_ha-Pletah", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "397742", "label": {"eng": "Sh'erit ha-Pletah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debra_Messing", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "481217", "label": {"eng": "Debra Messing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akiva_ben_Joseph", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "653267", "label": {"eng": "Akiva ben Joseph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isi_Leibler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "1032229", "label": {"eng": "Isi Leibler"}}]}

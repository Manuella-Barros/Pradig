It's an honour we now get to be that inspiration'", "text": "NEXT MONTH AMEE-LEIGH Murphy Crowe will finally become an Olympian, having taken the first steps on her Olympic journey 10 long years ago. The Tipperary native was first capped by the Ireland Sevens in 2014, and even in the early days of her Sevens career, representing Ireland on the world\u2019s biggest sporting stage was always the goal. Yet the road to Paris has been far from straightforward. Murphy Crowe was part of the squads that missed out on qualification for the 2016 and 2020 Games before last year the Ireland women finally got over the line, booking their place in Paris at a World Series event in Toulouse last summer. \u201cIt\u2019s come full circle from not even being able to win a game throughout a World Series event, then qualifying for one of the biggest Games of our lives,\u201d says Murphy-Crowe, who has established herself as one of the brightest talents on the Sevens circuit. Murphy-Crowe was a talented athlete growing up, which will be no surprise to anyone who has watched the 29-year-old ripping through defences with a rugby ball in her hand. The 100 metres and long jump were her disciplines of choice before deciding to try rugby in her mid-teens, after a brief spell playing football. The rugby career didn\u2019t take long to ignite, Murphy-Crowe playing her way into the Munster U18s and Ireland U19s before being drafted into the Sevens programme. She\u2019s moved between programmes over the years to play for the Ireland 15s, but Sevens has remained her prime focus. Yet while the Sevens programme has been a major focus of the IRFU \u2013 and in particular outgoing high performance director David Nucifora \u2013 it\u2019s yet to properly capture the imagination of the wider Irish public. The hope is that Paris proves a turning point. Both the mens and womens squads are travelling to the Games with realistic medal hopes and moving from online streams to primetime slots on RT\u00c9 brings with it the potential for players to become household names. Murphy Crowe is one of the most exciting players on the Sevens circuit. Joe Hamby / INPHO Joe Hamby / INPHO / INPHO For all the money that\u2019s been pumped into the programme, nothing would boost the profile of Sevens quite like Olympic success. \u201cKnowing that RT\u00c9 are going to have it on TV, anyone can come into their sitting room now and just pop it on,\u201d says Murphy-Crowe. \u201cLike, we all know when we\u2019re at home, everyone throws on the Olympic Games, whichever sport is on that day, it\u2019s just on the television and the television is just running. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to be great to see that exposure, like someone might just turn it on and watch it for seven minutes and that\u2019s only a half of one of our games. And then, you know, you could inspire some young boy or girl to actually want to be an Olympian for Ireland, which again is the purpose of our programme and the purpose of why we play this sport is just to inspire the next generation. \u201cI know I\u2019ve been inspired through Sonia O\u2019Sullivan, through Katie Taylor, through Kellie Harrington, through the Irish hockey girls, they are all inspirations that I took throughout watching the Olympic Games and it\u2019s just an honour that we now get to be that inspiration that people look up to.\u201d Murphy Crowe is conscious of soaking up the experience in Paris but also feels there is a responsibility that comes with representing your country at the Olympics. \u201cThe Athletes Village is going to be absolutely amazing, you\u2019re going to see complete superstars over there, but we are one of them so we will be amongst them and we just have to get in there and accept that and embrace it and know that you are now one of the best sports people in this world. It\u2019s a very small percentage. \u201cAnd I do believe that we\u2019ll perform heading into Paris,\u201d she continues. Ireland won gold in Perth in January. Travis Hayto / INPHO Travis Hayto / INPHO / INPHO \u201cWe\u2019ve done so much preparation and there\u2019s still more to come, we still have a European leg to play in Hamburg. \u201cI think if you don\u2019t believe, you\u2019re missing something, you\u2019re missing some element in the game because you\u2019ve got to believe in yourself, you\u2019ve got to believe in your players, you\u2019ve got to believe in the game plan, and I solely believe in that, in believing in the team. I always do.\u201d And yet the Olympics will be just one of many milestone in Murphy Crowe\u2019s life this year. Two weeks after the Games she has a hen party booked in ahead of her wedding in November, where Ireland teammates Lucy Rock and Stacey Flood will be bridesmaids alongside Murphy Crowe\u2019s sisters Kelsie and Lily Ella. Looking a little further down the line, Murphy Crowe isn\u2019t ruling out a return to 15s for next year\u2019 Women\u2019s Rugby World Cup, but insists Sevens is the \u201csole focus\u201d for now. And understandably so. While the squad have seen results tail off in recent months, a first ever gold medal won on the Perth leg of the World Series in January is a reminder of what this group have the potential to achieve, and will serve as motivation heading to Paris. \u201cThat benchmark is now set, we know exactly how it feels to sing the anthem in a final, we know exactly how to play a top team, how to beat them and knowing that is extra special. Like, it\u2019s in us, it\u2019s within the group, it\u2019s within the backroom staff, it\u2019s within our game plan. \u201cIt comes back to just knowing we\u2019ve done it. We just have to make sure that we actually stick to the process and how we\u2019ve trained and then how we bring that into our game.\u201d", "summary": "After 10 years playing Sevens for Ireland, Amee-Leigh Murphy Crowe is getting ready to become an Olympian.", "url": "https://www.the42.ie/amee-leigh-murphy-crowe-olympics-6419418-Jun2024/", "image": "https://img2.thejournal.ie/article/6419418/river/?height=400&version=6422176", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:30:21", "author": "View All Articles", "authors": ["View All Articles"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.335}

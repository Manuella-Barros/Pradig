Former Mormon Alyssa Grenfell, 31, often shares her experiences from living within in the strict religion, culminating with her leaving the church. In a recent clip, Alyssa shared the commonly used slang - and what they mean in the Mormon community. The first one was 'NCMO' - which stands for non-committal make out session. 'This is essentially the Mormon version of a booty call and is very common at BYU (Brigham Young University - a private Mormon college),' the mom-of-two explained. Next, she moved on to 'Levi lovin,' which the former Mormon explains is a 'Mormon term that refers to dry humping.' 'This is basically the motions of having sex while clothed,' she explained. Alyssa then listed an infamous term that non-Mormons may be familiar with - soaking. When couples don't want to 'sin' by having premarital sex, some instead engage in an act called soaking, which refers to a man sexually penetrating a woman without thrusting or moving. 'Though I swear this is just a Mormon myth,' the YouTube personality quipped. Another term used in Mormon communities was 'Fill your canteen.' As Alyssa explained, the term comes from when a member of the church serves on a Mormon mission. 'They can have no physical contact with the opposite sex so that means they have to fill their canteen with as many NCMOs as possible,' she said. '[It's so] they have something to remember when they are lonely missionaries,' she said cheekily. The last term was 'sweet spirit' - which Alyssa says is a 'mean term' for a girl who is unattractive 'but has a kind heart.' 'There's a song about this in a Mormon movie and the best line is she's only getting married if we bring back polygamy,' she said. She captioned the YouTube video: 'Never going to find an eternal companion if you\u2019re just someone\u2019s NCMO.' Alyssa grew up within the confines of an ultra-strict household but escaped the uptight lifestyle, and began to focus on reclaiming her body after leaving the Mormon church with her husband in 2017. Alyssa, who now lives in Austin, Texas with her husband and two children, previously opened up about what it was like to attend the strict religious college BYU. The college is known for its campus culture and regulations, which are closely aligned with the teachings of the faith. After renouncing the religion age 25, Alyssa proudly underwent a post-Mormon glow up that included getting a nose ring and tattoos as well as wearing a bikini for the first time at 28 years old. In another video, she described the 'painful' process of getting married in the Mormon church, with the church controlling every aspect of the wedding, including choosing her dress for her. She's also since come out with a book called How to Leave the Mormon Church: An Exmormon\u2019s Guide to Rebuilding After Religion, which she recently snuck onto the shelves of BYU's library, as she documented on TikTok.", "summary": "Former Mormon Alyssa Grenfell, who now lives in Austin, Texas, has shared the commonly used dating slang - and what they mean in the Mormon community.

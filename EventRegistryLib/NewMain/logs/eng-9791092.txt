He quickly became a key player for us and developed into one of the best players in the Bundesliga,\" Schafer added.\n\n\"We're extremely pleased that he recognised RB Leipzig as the best place to continue his development and that he believes in our ambitious targets, despite strong interest from other big clubs both in Germany and abroad.\"\n\nSimons still has three years left to run on his deal with PSG, whom he initially joined from Barcelona's La Masia academy in 2019 but made just 11 senior appearances for before leaving on a free transfer for PSV in 2022.\n\nIt is still unclear whether Simons fits into Luis Enrique's long-term plans at PSG, so Arsenal and Man United could very well rekindle their interest in the 21-year-old when his second Leipzig loan comes to an end.\n\nID:549713:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect5386:", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_knapton@sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Ben Knapton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi_Simons", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xavi Simons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Arena_(New_Jersey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull Arena (New Jersey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFL-Supercup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DFL-Supercup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_des_Princes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parc des Princes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Masia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Masia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://sm.imgix.net/24/25/xavi-simons.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791092", "eventUri": "eng-9791092", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

Xavi Simons heads back to RB Leipzig", "body": "\"I will make my decision after the Euros,\" Xavi Simons said when asked about his future at the European Championships this summer. Ultimately, the decision came down to two clubs for the Dutch playmaker. Should he remain at RB Leipzig for one more year or continue his career at Bayern Munich? Both clubs made enticing offers for the talented midfielder, who is still under contract at Paris Saint-Germain until 2027. Bayern offered a loan deal with an option to buy, and Leipzig offered another straight-up loan deal. We now have a decision.\n\nThis Monday, RB Leipzig confirmed that Simons would return to the club on loan for one more season. Last season Simons scored eight goals in 32 Bundesliga games for Leipzig, and will be hoping to have a similar impact next season. Meanwhile Bayern Munich already moved their attention away from Simons and instead are trying to win the race to sign French attacking midfielder D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Dou\u00e9 from Stade Rennais.\n\nSo how did Leipzig win the race for Simons? There are multiple factors. At first glance, it appears odd that PSG are willing to once again loan out a player that could help replace superstar Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. Indeed, there is no doubt that Simons and PSG are at odds with one another, and another loan might just buy the French giants some time to fix that relationship.\n\nThe other factor is Simons himself. The playmaker wants to keep his options open for the 2025/26 season. A loan-to-buy move to Bayern would have cemented his future for the next few years. By staying at Leipzig, Simons will have multiple options next summer, including a move to the Premier League. One of the clubs interested in Simons this summer had been Manchester United. But the Red Devils won't be alone in their interest in Simons. Indeed, Simons recently switched agencies and is now represented by the English agent Darren Dein to help facilitate a potential transfer to the Premier League in 2025.\n\nThere is also no doubt that staying at Leipzig for now would help Simons' development immensely. Simons had a breakout year for the Bundesliga club last season, scoring ten goals and 15 assists in 43 games across all competitions. Simons combined eight goals and 13 assists in 32, which ranked him 12th overall in the Bundesliga last season. Simons also displayed his playmaking ability with 43 smart passes, which ranked him second in the Bundesliga behind Florian Wirtz. Simons then followed this up with one goal and three assists at Euro 2024, helping the Netherlands reach the semifinal of the tournament.\n\nAll those numbers are impressive. At the same time, there has also been a sense that Simons is far from the finished product. With that in mind, RB Leipzig are the perfect club to help him with that development for another season. The Simons team will have also noticed that the city rolled out the red carpet for him while playing with the Netherlands against France at Euro 2024. RB Leipzig had posters throughout the city with Simons' face on it. Often, details decide a transfer, and who knows, maybe that support helped Leipzig get this deal across the line.", "source": {"uri": "transfermarkt.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "transfermarkt.co.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi_Simons", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xavi Simons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Rennais_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade Rennais F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florian_Wirtz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florian Wirtz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://tmssl.akamaized.net/images/foto/big/xavi-simons-rb-leipzig-rumor-1722021176-143531.png?lm=1722021187", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791092", "eventUri": "eng-9791092", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

He has already been influential, and could raise his market value further by next summer.\n\nAnd this could prompt PSG to sell him at a huge price if they can't integrate him into their first team.", "source": {"uri": "technosports.co.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechnoSports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arsh_das@technosports.co.in", "name": "Arsh Das", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi_Simons", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xavi Simons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gaelic/Shinty", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gaelic/Shinty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://technosports.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/licensed-image-6-1024x683.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791092", "eventUri": "eng-9791092", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

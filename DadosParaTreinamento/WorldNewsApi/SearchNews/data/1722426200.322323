{"id": 243311180, "title": "Nurse struck off after 'forcing' meds into dying patient at Sutton Coldfield care home", "text": "A Sutton Coldfield nurse who put a patient at risk of 'psychological and physical harm' by administering medicine by 'force' has been struck off. Floriana Bizdoaca, a former nurse at Hafod Nursing Home, 'pinched' and 'pulled' a resident's nose so their head was tilted back in order to administer diazepam, a Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) panel heard. The misconduct probe related to charges that Ms Bizdoaca administered medication to a dementia patient 'by force', and in doing so, failed to treat them with 'dignity, compassion and care.' The panel found Ms Bizdoaca, who continued working for four years after the incident in June 2020, guilty of breaching the 'fundamental tenets of the nursing profession.' Ms Bizdoaca was also found guilty of giving 'misleading' information to the NMC during the investigation for failing to disclose that she was also employed at a different care home in the area. Ms Bizdoaca was given a striking-off order with an 18-month suspension order, which can be reviewed before it expires. READ MORE: Disgraced teacher struck off for having sex with pupil A Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) panel met from June 3 - June 7 for the virtual hearing. The allegations related to events which took place in June and July 2020, with the delays in the proceedings attributed to 'backlogs and the impact of the pandemic.' 'The liquid was around their mouth' Ms Bizdoaca was alleged to have caused 'harm' to a vulnerable patient (Resident A) by forcibly administering them medication at Hafod Nursing Home in Sutton Coldfield - a 29-bed nursing home on Anchorage Road where Bizdoaca had worked for 'over a year.' The panel heard how Resident A, who had dementia, was bed-bound and approaching the end of their life. Resident A routinely demonstrated behaviours of 'restlessness and agitation' which would be treated with diazepam, if it was not possible to calm them down. The charges related to events which occurred on June 20 2020 where Ms Bizdoaca was accused of 'administering medication to Resident A by force.' A witness statement presented to the panel read: \"I [saw] Flo go into Resident A's bedroom attempting to give Resident A the liquid medication\u2026 [she] was refusing and attempted to push Flo away. I then [saw] Flo hold Resident A's hand and re-attempt. \"[Resident A] was still refusing and then Flo used the palm of her hand to push Resident A's head back to administer the liquid medication. Resident A was still refusing [and] at that point Flo pinched Resident A's nose and pulled her nose up so her head went back. The liquid was around Resident A's mouth, Flo cleaned her mouth and I heard Flo say 'you will have to have an injection now.\" The same witness claimed that they did not recall Ms Bizdoaca cleaning the patient before leaving the room. Bizdoaca initially told the panel that there was 'minimal physical contact' during the incident, but later accounts in the hearing evidenced a higher level of contact. Ms Bizdoaca faced a separate charge of being 'dishonest' to the NMC about not working elsewhere, when she was commencing new employment at Absolute Care Homes (Central) Ltd, also known as Boldmere Court Care Home. The panel noted how Ms Bizdoaca 'corrected' this position with the NMC over the following days. 'Risk of physical and psychological harm' The NMC Panel found Ms Bizdoaca 'failed to act towards Resident A in a way which was compassionate, preserved Resident A's dignity and offered an appropriate standard of care.' It also found that her actions fell 'significantly short of the standards expected of a registered nurse' and put Resident A at risk of 'physical and psychological harm.' Representing Ms Bizdoaca, legal counsel Ryan Ross told the panel how the registrant was of 'previous good character' and had worked for four years both in the UK and Italy 'without any challenges to [her] professional practice' in the years since the incident leading up to her hearing. The panel also heard how testimonials since that time had identified an 'embarrassment of riches' in terms of positive comments about her professionalism and good conduct. In spite of this, the panel found that Ms Bizdoaca failed to reflect on how her actions impacted Resident A, their family and her colleagues, as well as the reputation of the nursing profession. The panel was satisfied that the misconduct in this case was capable of 'remediation', and that Bizdoaca's 'dishonesty' was a single incident around communication with the NMC, yet there remained a 'risk of repetition'. The panel decided that a finding of impairment was necessary on the grounds of public protection. The panel concluded: \"[Bizdoaca] used force to administer medication to a vulnerable, elderly patient who was suffering from dementia and approaching end of life. [She] also gave misleading information and was dishonest in response to a direct question from your regulator, such that it had the potential to undermine the NMC discharging its functions. \"The panel found [her] actions fell well short of the standards expected of a registered nurse and amount to serious misconduct. [Bizdoaca] breached fundamental tenets of the nursing profession, in relation to [her] dishonesty and failing to act with compassion towards, in this case, a vulnerable resident.\" Ms Bizdoaca was struck off the nursing registrar with an 18-month suspension order. If no appeal is made, the suspension order will be replaced by the substantive striking off order.", "summary": "Floriana Bizdoaca, a former nurse at Hafod Nursing Home, was found to have put a 'vulnerable' patient at risk of 'physical and psychological harm'", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/nurse-struck-after-forcing-meds-29412377", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article29412406.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screenshot-2024-06-24-124910.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:15:00", "author": "Nathan Clarke", "authors": ["Nathan Clarke"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.717}

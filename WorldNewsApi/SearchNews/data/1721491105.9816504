The runway icon, 43, soaked up the sun with her jiu-jitsu instructor boyfriend, 36, and the children she shares with ex-husband Tom Brady, daughter Vivian, 11, and son Benjamin, 14, in Miami on Sunday. She shared a board with her daughter and steered the vessel around the harbor while her son got his own board. Joaquim showcased his toned physique as he went shirtless, rocking swimming trunks for the athletic endeavor. The outing came ahead of Brady's broadcasting debut for Fox on Sunday evening. Gisele kicked off summer a few days early as she enjoyed some quality time with her family out in the water. The four looked relaxed as they leisurely made their way about the harbor. Gisele displayed her summery eye for style in a black scoop neck tank, denim shorts, and a wide-brim straw hat propped upon her golden locks. Joaquim was also seen connecting with Benjamin as the duo paddle boarded alongside one another. It comes after Gisele and her boyfriend were spotted for the first time following reports their romance fizzled due to the stress of the Tom Brady roast. They were previously spotted Saturday putting on an affectionate display as they went for a stroll in Seaside, Florida. It marked the first time the duo had been seen together in about two months. Gisele and Joaquim started dating one year ago in June 2023. She confirmed her romance with Valente and denied cheating on ex-husband Brady during an interview with The New York Times earlier this year. Gisele also stated that she was concerned about the spread of misconceptions regarding her personal life. 'This is something that happens to a lot of women who get blamed when they have the courage to leave an unhealthy relationship and are labeled as being unfaithful... Of course, for me, it just happens to be a little bit amplified,' she said. The Louis Vuitton model added that she did not 'want to make my life a tabloid and that she had not planned to 'open myself up to' criticism. The latest beach outing also came ahead of Brady's broadcasting debut on Fox. Tom, who was married to Bundchen from 2009 to 2022, covered the United Football League (UFL) Championship - and was heavily booed as he made his broadcasting debut. The 46-year-old, seven-time Super Bowl champion was in the booth with Joel Klatt and Curt Menefree for Sunday night's game before being jeered by folks in St. Louis when gracing the field to reward Birmingham Stallions quarterback Adrian Martinez with the MVP Trophy. The Stallions had defeated the San Antonio Brahmas, 25-0, to accomplish a three-peat. Perhaps, the animosity stemmed from Super Bowl XXXVI on February 3, 2002, when Brady, who was 24 years old at the time and in his second year on the New England Patriots, caused an upset against the heavily favored St. Louis Rams. What's more is that before the UFL game, Brady had chatted with Kurt Warner, the opposing quarterback in that Super Bowl and one of the leaders on The Greatest Show on Turf. In their discussion, Warner questioned the validity of the Patriots win after Brady and Co. were later entrenched in the Spygate scandal in 2007.", "summary": "The runway icon, 43, soaked up the sun with her jiu-jitsu instructor boyfriend, 36, and the children she shares with ex-husband Tom Brady, daughter Vivian, 11, and son Benjamin, 14.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13539567/Gisele-Bundchen-Joaquim-Valente-Fathers-Day.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/17/19/86233041-0-image-m-60_1718649387924.jpg", "video": "https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/05/23/1406895468346127241/1024x576_MP4_1406895468346127241.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:53:15", "author": "Christine Rendon,Editor", "authors": ["Christine Rendon", "Editor"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.235}

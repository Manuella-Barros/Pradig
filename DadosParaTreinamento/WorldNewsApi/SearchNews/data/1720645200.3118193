{"id": 231360406, "title": "Scots couple among 20 arrested by Spanish cops for 'involvement in sex ring", "text": "A Scots couple are among 20 people who have been arrested by Spanish cops for their alleged involvement in a sex ring. In a joint probe between police in Spain and UK agents from the National Crime Agency (NCA) and the Regional Organised Crime Unit (ROCU), 20 people were arrested. The 20 includes Scotland-born Natalie and Neil Lock for allegedly making thousands of pounds a week from sex work exploitation and trafficking. The sex gang that operated between Spain and the UK is said to have sought out victims in vulnerable situations due to their dependence on drugs. They reportedly even coerced one of them, who was pregnant, to have an abortion so they could continue sexually exploiting her. Kingpins of the exploitation ring allegedly recruited their victims in countries across Europe, then used the women to offer sexual services in the United Kingdom, which brought in high profits. The alleged leader of the organisation and his family lived in Spain, where it is thought, they controlled the practice of prostitution and payments for remote sexual services. They maintained a high standard of living with the benefits obtained through sexual exploitation. A member of the network managed the publication of advertisements from Alicante through a contact website that openly advertised the prostitution of women. The organisation allegedly regularly transferred the profits of its criminal activity to recipients outside the United Kingdom, in Spain. Those involved reportedly took advantage of the victims, specifically women in a vulnerable situation with dependence on psychoactive substances, and forced them to perform sexual services throughout the day and, on numerous occasions, without the use of a condom. The probe started after detecting a network that offered sexual services as an escort agency in the United Kingdom and whose leaders were in Spain, detecting that those allegedly involved acquired real estate properties in our country with the benefits they obtained from their criminal activity. A spokesperson for the Spanish force said: \"Agents of the National Police, in a joint operation with British agents from the National Crime Agency (NCA) and the Regional Organised Crime Unit (ROCU), have arrested 20 people who were part of a criminal organisation that sexually exploited vulnerable women. \"The network obtained profits amounting to thousands of pounds a week from exploitation in the United Kingdom, which they illegally transferred to recipients in Spain.\" They added: \"The investigation has culminated in the arrest of 20 people, two in the city of Madrid and 18 in the United Kingdom, as allegedly responsible for the crimes of human trafficking, related to prostitution, money laundering and membership in a criminal organisation. \"Four searches have been carried out, two in Madrid and two in Alicante, in which more than 4,000 euros in cash, ten mobile phones, six computers, tablets, bank cards, jewellery and documentation related to the investigation have been seized.\" Don't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "summary": "Kingpins of the explotation ring allegedly recruited their victims in countries across Europe, then used the women to offer sexual services in the United Kingdom, which brought in high profits.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-couple-among-20-arrested-32989400", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32989505.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Screenshot-2024-06-08-162850.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:22:49", "author": "Iona Young", "authors": ["Iona Young"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.139}

Ivanishvili is reported to be worth between $5 billion and $7 billion, having made his fortune in metals and banking in post-Soviet Russia.\n\nWhile he is said to have sold off his Russian assets ahead of his term as prime minister, some non-government groups have raised concern of continued ties to the Russian economy, and his Georgian Dream party has been criticized for maintaining friendly ties with the Kremlin at the expense of closer ties with Europe.\n\nIn April, Ivanishvili gave a rare public address accusing a Western \"global war party\" of meddling in Georgia -- part of a campaign by Georgian Dream officials criticizing Europe and the U.S. as trying to push Tbilisi into war with Russia on behalf of supporting Ukraine.\n\nThe bipartisan letter comes as legislation has stalled in Congress to impose costs on Georgian government officials identified as undermining democratic processes, security in Georgia and violating human rights.\n\nThe bill, called the MEGOBARI Act, which means \"friend\" in Georgian, passed out of the House Foreign Affairs Committee earlier this month with overwhelming bipartisan support. But the House went into recess last week, freezing any new legislative activity. The House is expected to return in September.\n\n\"We believe these actions would strongly complement our bill, the Mobilizing and Enhancing Georgia's Options for Building Accountability, Resilience, and Independence (MEGOBARI) Act,\" the lawmakers wrote of sanctions.\n\n\"This legislation would help bolster democratic practices, human rights, and the rule of law in Georgia, and reaffirm the United States' commitment to supporting Georgia's Euro-Atlantic integration and countering the influence of authoritarian regimes, particularly Russia.\"\n\nThe Biden administration started to exercise consequences on some Georgian government officials in May, following the passage of a so-called foreign influence law in the country. The Georgian government argues that the legislation increases transparency in the funding sources for non-government organizations, but critics say it serves to suppress and criminalize opposition, independent media and civil society groups.\n\nOpponents of the foreign influence law said it directly mirrors Russian legislation passed in 2012 that has decimated the free press, civil society organizations and political opposition. Critics of the law warn its implementation, set to take place in September, will allow the government to stifle political opposition ahead of the October election.\n\nThe Biden administration has put in place authorities to impose visa restrictions on individuals in Georgia it deems \"responsible for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia,\" as well as members of their family members.\n\nBut the bipartisan group of lawmakers said \"the pace and severity of events on the ground suggest to us that more needs to be done urgently to protect the Georgian population.\"\n\n\"It must be made clear that the principal agents of corruption and malign influence in or in league with anti-Western elements in Georgia will not be free to prey on the Georgian people and attack its democracy at will,\" the lawmakers wrote.\n\nThe lawmakers further called for the Biden administration to crack down on \"'scam' call centers\" around the world that they say is a source of \"dark money that sustains Georgian Dream's system of sprawling and malign patronage...\"\n\n\"We believe it is urgently imperative for the State Department, in cooperation with U.S. and friendly foreign law enforcement agencies, to take swift, immediate, and systematic action against these call center networks and other such efforts internationally to destroy or disrupt their operations,\" the lawmakers wrote.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laura_kelly@thehill.com", "name": "Laura Kelly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

It has been criticized by the domestic opposition and the West as a Russian-inspired measure to crack down on dissent.\n\nThe bill's passage led to a major breakdown in relations between the West and Georgia, since 1991 among the most pro-Western of the Soviet Union's successor states.\n\nThe pause on U.S. assistance is the result of a review of bilateral cooperation that was announced, along with visa restrictions, in May, Blinken said. Those actions had triggered Georgia's ruling party to accuse Washington of pursuing a policy of \"threats and blackmail.\"\n\n\"The Georgian government's anti-democratic actions and false statements are incompatible with membership norms in the EU and NATO,\" Blinken said in a statement. Washington will continue assistance that benefit the people of the South Caucasus country, he added.\n\nThe Georgian government did not immediately comment on Blinken's announcement on Wednesday.\n\nThe European Union has also frozen some 30 million euros ($32 million) in military aid to Georgia.\n\n(Reporting by Ismail Shakil in Ottawa; Editing by Doina Chiacu)", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@aol.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_reuters_29/859a2d4543e238b3b428b2b294e3b613", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779200", "eventUri": "eng-9779200", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

EU leaders effectively put the brakes on negotiations in June, in response to democratic backsliding. It also froze \u20ac30 million destined for the Caucasus country of some 3.7 million people.\n\nIn so doing, the EU faces a dilemma: Upholding its democratic values, some regional analysts say, could benefit undemocratic adversaries. That means foremost Vladimir Putin's Russia.\n\n\"Russia will be very happy to see [a] more isolated Georgia,\" Kornely Kakachia, the director of the Georgian Institute of Politics, a Western-funded think tank, told The Parliament from the Georgian capital of Tbilisi. \"It gives chances to illiberal powers like Russia, China to influence Georgian politics.\"\n\nRegardless of what the Georgian people might want -- some polls indicate nearly 90% of the population favour EU membership -- their government may be happy to strike a balancing act between Brussels and Moscow. Given its geographic proximity to Georgia and history of overseeing it during the Soviet era, the Kremlin is in a strong position to \"exercise control over [it], and it knows how to do it,\" Natalie Sabanadze, a senior research fellow in Eurasian affairs at London-based Chatham House, told The Parliament.\n\nRussia is already physically present in part of Georgia, occupying the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia since a swift invasion in 2008 helped Russian political allies there establish breakaway republics. Few countries recognise them as such.\n\nMost Western observers look back at the 2008 invasion and see it as a blueprint for the much larger one of Ukraine in February 2022 -- what Kakachia called Russian President Putin's expansionist vision to reestablish Russia as a global power. As now with the EU, Georgia then was flirting with Western integration. Just months before Russia's invasion, NATO floated the idea of bringing Georgia into the military alliance, which was founded to confront the extinct Soviet threat.\n\nExerting more control over Georgia, which borders the energy-rich and strategically important Black Sea, would expand Russia's \"sphere of influence,\" Sabanadze said. As it is, Russia appears to have plans to build a naval base at the port of Ochamchire, in Abkhazia.\n\nDoing so would add to the Russian presence around the Black Sea, a commercial gateway to the eastern Mediterranean and beyond. Military occupation of parts of Ukraine and Moldova, EU candidate countries, already afford Russia some amount of control of the region. Further south, Russia still has troops in Syria, where it is allies with President Bashar Assad.\n\n\"This situation with occupied territories and the question of status will never be resolved because it's one of the pressure mechanisms that Russia has over Georgia and will maintain it,\" Sabanadze said, referring to Abkhazia and South Ossetia.\n\nWith EU accession talks halted, she said, Russia's control of that Georgian territory remains largely a domestic issue.\n\nGeorgia never restored diplomatic relations with Russia as a result of its assault. What Putin could not achieve militarily, Kakachia said, he is now trying to do with soft power. This includes spreading pro-Russian and anti-Western propaganda. At least some of the Georgian population, especially those in rural and economically depressed areas, may be receptive to it.\n\nThe case for the European Council's recent decision to halt Georgia's progress towards EU membership is clear enough. Georgian Dream, the party that dominates national politics and is ambivalent towards Russia, passed a foreign agents law in the spring, which democracy advocates have criticised for targeting civil society and free media in the same vein of a similar law in Russia.\n\nMassive public protest in Georgia failed to stop its implementation, which EU leaders consider a \"backsliding on the steps set out in the Commission's recommendation for candidate status,\" according to the European Council's conclusions published last month.\n\nThe reversal came barely six months after greenlighting accession negotiations.\n\nThe EU's decision so far appears to have had little impact on Georgia's political elites. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze brushed off concerns, saying in June that European integration \"remains the main foreign policy priority\" and that \"by 2030, Georgia will be prepared better than any other candidate country.\"\n\nIronically, it is the Georgian Dream that applied for EU membership shortly after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. The party's influential founder and one-time Georgian prime minister, the billionaire businessman Bidzina Ivanishvili, is eyeing developments there closely since \"the outcome of the war in Ukraine will decide a lot of things, including the fate of Georgia and European security,\" Kakachia said.\n\n\"He thinks that the West is weak, so he needs to accommodate Russia's geopolitical interests,\" he added.\n\nThe European Council did not comment on how its move may benefit Russia, even if inadvertently. The EU is in a delicate situation, Kakachia said, needing to enforce democratic norms required for membership on one hand without pushing Georgia too much on the other. High levels of public support in Georgia for the EU are not the same as embracing democracy; at least some of that domestic EU spirit, he said, is pure economic interest with little regard for democratic development.\n\nThe Brussels-Moscow pendulum should become clearer in October, when Georgians vote in parliamentary elections. Georgian Dream is hoping to have successfully thread the needle of competing interests and stay in power.\n\n\"The opposition will try, together with the president, to frame these elections as a referendum on Georgia's European future,\" Chatham House's Sabanadze said, referring to Salome Zourabishvili, the Western-leaning president whose veto of the foreign agents bill the Georgian Dream-dominated parliament overturned to make into law.\n\n\"Georgian Dream will frame it as a choice between war and peace,\" she added.\n\nThe narrative could prove effective. Georgia's experience from 2008, like Ukraine's since 2014, shows that Putin will not hesitate to interfere militarily if he feels a country in his backyard is straying from his influence. That fear among voters could be enough to bolster Georgian Dream's electoral chances, thereby diminishing the EU's reach.\n\nIn a recent campaign speech, Ivanishvili capitalised on those fears.\n\n\"We need an especially strong victory, which is equal to the constitutional majority, to finally put an end to the war party, the network of agents, radicalism, polarization and liberal fascism in Georgia,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "theparliamentmagazine.eu", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Parliament Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

At the EU Council Summit, EU leaders also decided to suspend the accession process for Georgia. EU Ambassador to Georgia Pawe\u0142 Herczy\u0144ski said that the EU decisions were the result of the adoption by Georgia of the foreign agents law and recent anti-democratic steps taken by the Georgian government.\n\nThe letter from the Danish Embassy notes that in 2023, Denmark and Georgia launched a four-year military cooperation with a total budget of approximately DKK 71.5 million (about USD 10 million 360 thousand). \"This includes for instance the deployment of Voluntary National Contributions, donations, and facilitation of training and course activities as well as seminars and conferences,\" the letter reads. The letter does not specify exactly what kind of aid and assistance is being withheld, or which projects are to be stopped.\n\nThe letter concludes with a call from Denmark for the Georgian government to \"return to the Euro-Atlantic path and adhere to the EU reform agenda,\" saying this is \"the foundation for strong bilateral ties\" between the two countries.\n\nFollowing the adoption of the controversial foreign agents law, this is yet another Georgian partner that has decided to review bilateral relations and suspend some of the crucial aid to Georgian state institutions.\n\nOn July 5, the U.S. Department of Defense announced the indefinite postponement of the Noble Partner exercise, initially scheduled for July 25, to August 6 of this year. The U.S. is also conducting the full review of bilateral relations with Georgia.\n\nOn July 9, Pawe\u0142 Herczy\u0144ski, the European Union's Ambassador to Georgia, stated that the EU accession process had been halted and that the EU's 30 million Euros aid to the Georgian Defense Ministry had been frozen. The Ambassador regretted the low level of EU-Georgia relations, saying that they could have been at an all-time high.\n\nOn July 10, Peter Fischer, the German Ambassador to Georgia, announced Germany's decision to stop any new financial commitments to Georgia, to halt its military participation in the Noble Partner exercise, and to cancel an important legal conference because of the GD's recent anti-Western decisions.", "source": {"uri": "civil.ge", "dataType": "news", "title": "Civil.ge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_the_European_Union", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Council of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Georgia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil Georgia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_of_Georgia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense of Georgia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawe\u0142_Herczy\u0144ski", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pawe\u0142 Herczy\u0144ski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_backsliding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic backsliding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Foreign_and_Security_Policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Common Foreign and Security Policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_krone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Danish krone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Turkey_to_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accession of Turkey to the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Western_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Western sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nobility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bilateralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlargement_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enlargement of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Announcers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Announcers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Conferences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://civil.ge/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Flag-of-Denmark.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779200", "eventUri": "eng-9779200", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-05", "textStart": 2124, "textEnd": 2130}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 2256, "textEnd": 2263}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 2268, "textEnd": 2276}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 2376, "textEnd": 2382}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 2712, "textEnd": 2719}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Kevin Costner's ambitious franchise may struggle to gain momentum for its upcoming sequels. The self-funded Horizon Chapter 1 may need a VOD boost to salvage hopes for the future of the series.\n\nKevin Costner's highly anticipated new Western movie franchise Horizon: An American Saga may already be doomed. Despite earning a positive audience score of 71% on Rotten Tomatoes, critics have been mixed on Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1, which was released in theaters on June 28, 2024. In roughly two weeks since its wide release, Horizon has earned roughly $24 million worldwide against its reported budget of $100 million, 38% of which was self-funded by Costner. This may spell trouble for a franchise that's anticipated to be extended into a four-part movie series.\n\nCostner's vision for his Horizon franchise has always been ambitious but he had been willing to place a big bet on himself in his first directorial effort since 2003's Open Range. The heavy 3-hour 1-minute runtime of Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1 may have provided one of the strongest cases for audiences to wait until the film becomes available to rent and purchase at home on July 15. Still, the disappointing opening weekend box office of the first Horizon installment is undeniably concerning after its weak $11 million start and sets up a potential disaster for the upcoming second chapter set to be released on August 16, 2024.\n\nRelated Horizon: An American Saga's Ending & How It Impacts Chapter 2 Explained By Kevin Costner\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Kevin Costner explains the ending of Horizon: An American Saga and how it impacts Chapter 2, hinting at what's next for its ensemble cast.\n\nHorizon: An American Saga Chapter 1's Box Office Is Not Improving Horizon already has a set VOD release date to help stop the bleeding\n\nTypically, disappointing box office numbers of this caliber would quickly dispel any immediate notions of an impending sequel.\n\nHorizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1 had a 50% drop in its worldwide box office on its second weekend. While this alone isn't bad for a big budget movie, it still needed a less significant decrease to have any chance of saving the film's box office performance. Typically, disappointing box office numbers of this caliber would quickly dispel any immediate notions of an impending sequel. However, considering that Costner has already produced, funded, and set a release date for Horizon's sequel, it creates an incredibly unusual circumstance for him and his once-promising franchise.\n\nThe lackluster box office performance of Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1 isn't aided by its mixed reviews and 48% Rotten Tomatoes critic score. Richard Brody of The New Yorker writes in his review, \"The three-hour Western, the first installment of a planned tetralogy, rushes through its many stories and straight past American history.\" Brian Lowry of CNN.com writes, \"Nobody has done more to keep the western flame kindling on the big screen than Kevin Costner, but the audacity of his latest rodeo feels like overreach, if not outright folly.\" Many critics agree the film did not live up to its hype.\n\nRelated How Much Horizon Has To Earn At The Box Office For Kevin Costner To Earn His Money Back Reportedly Revealed\n\nA new report breaks down Kevin Costner's personal investment in Horizon: An American Saga and how much the movie needs to earn for him to break even.\n\nHorizon: An American Saga Chapter 2's Imminent Release Is A Problem There seems to be very little momentum heading into Chapter 2's August release Close\n\nThe unfortunate truth that Costner must face is that the back-to-back release of his first two Horizon films in the same summer may turn out to work against the franchise's prosperity. It's pretty clear that there's little immediate interest in the first movie based on the box office as it currently stands, so it's not exactly plausible to think there would be a sudden increase in interest for the first Horizon when the second film comes out roughly a month from now. Now that the first Horizon is headed for a swift VOD release, it may be the lifeline that the franchise needs in order to draw fans to theaters in August.\n\nLike many new releases nowadays, box office and immediate VOD at-home revenue can combine to paint a better picture of the otherwise disappointing theatrical performance. Additionally, Costner's fans have likely gotten quite used to watching him in the comfort of their homes on Yellowstone over the past few years and may actually prefer to wait for the Horizon films to become available on their televisions rather than flock to a movie theater. Unfortunately, it's too soon to know whether Horizon will become the successful franchise it was promised to be, but its VOD numbers need to give it a huge spike.\n\nRelated I'm Surprised By How Long Horizon: An American Saga Makes You Wait For Kevin Costner\n\nKevin Costner is the director and leading star of his Horizon: An American Saga blockbuster although it takes a while before his onscreen appearance.\n\nHorizon 3 & 4 Look Even Less Likely To Happen Now Horizon 1 & 2 must be profitable for 3 & 4 to happen\n\nThe question is, who is going to jump aboard now to fund Costner's anticipated sequels after the box office flop of its first installment?\n\nCostner still certainly has a lot of influence over the future of his Horizon franchise, but at the end of the day, it will come down to whether or not these films will become profitable. Costner struggled to attain financing for the first two films and had to put a whole lot of money up to make his passion project realized on the big screen. The question is, who is going to jump aboard now to fund Costner's anticipated sequels after the flop of its very first installment, especially in this increasingly timid Hollywood atmosphere? Costner may find a way to keep churning out his Horizon films but it may cost him more than it's worth.\n\nHorizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1 RDramaWestern\n\nHorizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1 is a Western film directed by Kevin Costner, and sees him in the starring role. The film explores multiple generations surrounding the expansion of the American West before and after the Civil War. Horizon is the first in a series of four films, all of which were greenlit by Warner Bros.

In two weeks of release, the first film, with an estimated cost of $100 million and a running time of 3 hours and 1 minute, has brought in just $24.5 million. Costner, who directed, co-wrote, produced and stars in \"Horizon,\" is reported to have invested some $38 million of his own money into the project.\n\nA statement from a New Line Cinema spokesperson read, \"Territory Pictures and New Line Cinema have decided not to release 'Horizon: Chapter 2' on August 16 in order to give audiences a greater opportunity to discover the first installment of 'Horizon' over the coming weeks, including on PVOD and Max. We thank our exhibition partners for their continued support as moviegoers across the US discover the film in its theatrical run.\"\n\nThe first installment of \"Horizon\" will hit premium video on demand services on July 16, while continuing to play in theaters. Its date to launch on the Max streaming service has not yet been announced.\n\nA separate statement from Territory Pictures read, \"The audience response to 'Horizon,' and enthusiasm for seeing our story continue in 'Horizon 2,' has been incredibly gratifying. Kevin made this film for people who love movies and who wanted to go on a journey. The support that we have received from film fans and the theater owners, as they experience the first chapter of this saga, only serves to reinforce our belief in them and the films that we have made, and we thank them for coming on board for the ride. We welcome the opportunity for that window to be expanded as we know it will only serve to enhance the experience of seeing 'Horizon 2.'\"\n\nThe news of the change in the release date for \"Chapter 2\" was first reported by The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe \"Horizon\" saga is set on the frontier of the American West during the Civil War. The first film establishes numerous storylines and many characters, played by a cast that, alongside Costner, includes Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Jena Malone, Luke Wilson, Isabelle Fuhrman, Tatanka Means, Ella Hunt, Abbey Lee and Danny Huston.\n\n\"Chapter 1\" ends with what is essentially a trailer for \"Chapter 2,\" implying that all the storytelling groundwork of the first film will begin to pay off in the second.

From the jump, Costner announced his intent to make four movies, and invested more than $30 million of his own money to make it happen. New Line Cinema and Warner Bros. signed on to distribute for a fee with Costner covering marketing costs. In an attempt to match his boldness, WB announced it would release Horizon: An American Saga -- Chapter 2 less than two months after the first film premiered. But then Horizon: An American Saga -- Chapter 1 flopped at the box office, and now the original plan is out the window.\n\nYes, Chapter 2 has been pulled from its August 16 release date at the agreement of New Line Cinema and Costner's Territory Pictures, per The Hollywood Reporter. This is in order to \"give audiences a greater opportunity to discover the first installment of Horizon over the coming weeks, including on PVOD and MAX.\" Presumably, this means Chapter 2 could still end up in theaters at a later date. Turning Horizon into a singular theatrical event with back-to-back premieres turned out to be a bad bet, but the new strategy of letting Chapter 1 breathe is actually more in line with Costner's vision. He's been saying since the film premiered at Cannes that movies are more than their opening weekend numbers. His bet, as the person who owns the complete rights to the movies, is that the series will have a long life outside of the theaters.\n\nGiven that the third and fourth installments haven't even been filmed yet, though, it's still a really expensive bet. And according to THR, a lot of cinemas that offered audiences a chance to buy advance tickets for Chapter 2 now have to issue refunds. The whole last-minute shake-up doesn't exactly inspire confidence, but Costner's camp nevertheless remains publicly bullish about the endeavor. \"The audience response to Horizon, and enthusiasm for seeing our story continue in Horizon 2, has been incredibly gratifying. Kevin made this film for people who love movies and who wanted to go on a journey,\" Territory Pictures said in its own statement. \"The support that we have received from film fans, and the theater owners, as they experience the first chapter of this saga only serves to reinforce our belief in them and the films that we have made, and we thank them for coming on board for the ride.

The second installment of Costner's Horizon: An American Saga has been abruptly pulled from its scheduled August 16 theatrical release, per The Hollywood Reporter. This decision follows the first chapter's disappointing performance at the box office earlier this summer.\n\nNew Line Pictures, the distributor, and Territory Pictures, Costner's production company, jointly agreed to postpone the film's release. Their primary goal is to allow more time for the initial installment to build an audience. As part of this strategy, Horizon -- Chapter 1 will be made available on PVOD starting July 16, though a release date for streaming on Max has not yet been determined.\n\nA New Line spokesperson stated, \"Territory Pictures and New Line Cinema have decided not to release 'Horizon: Chapter 2' on August 16 in order to give audiences a greater opportunity to discover the first installment of 'Horizon' over the coming weeks, including on PVOD and MAX. We thank our exhibition partners for their continued support as moviegoers across the US discover the film in its theatrical run.\"\n\nTerritory Pictures echoed the statement, noting, \"The audience response to Horizon, and enthusiasm for seeing our story continue in 'Horizon 2,' has been incredibly gratifying.

The support that we have received from film fans, and the theater owners, as they experience the first chapter of this saga only serves to reinforce our belief in them and the films that we have made, and we thank them for coming on board for the ride. We welcome the opportunity for that window to be expanded as we know it will only serve to enhance the experience of seeing 'Horizon 2.'\"\n\nThe Horizon films represent a significant financial investment, with a reported combined budget of $100 million, a substantial portion of which came from Costner's own pocket. However, the first installment has struggled to recoup its costs, generating only $23 million at the box office since its late June release.\n\nCritics have been less than enthusiastic about Horizon, with many describing it as a vanity project and drawing comparisons to an extended episode of Yellowstone. The film's reception at the Cannes Film Festival failed to generate the hoped-for buzz.\n\nDespite these setbacks, Costner remains committed to his vision. He has plans for at least two more chapters of Horizon, with production on Chapter 3 initially slated to begin in August. However, New Line had only agreed to distribute the first two films for a fee, with Costner himself shouldering the marketing costs.\n\nThe postponement of Horizon -- Chapter 2 leaves its new release date uncertain, potentially pushing it out of the current year altogether.

The studio had planned an unusually fast back-to-back release for the two \"Horizon\" films. But after the first chapter collected a modest $23 million in its first two weeks in theaters, the distributor pivoted.\n\n\"Territory Pictures and New Line Cinema have decided not to release 'Horizon: Chapter 2' on August 16 in order to give audiences a greater opportunity to discover the first installment of 'Horizon' over the coming weeks,\" a spokesperson for New Line said in a statement.\n\nFor now, the release of \"Chapter 2\" will be marked TBD on the theatrical calendar. The first \"Horizon,\" which opened in theaters on June 28, will land on premium on-demand July 16. No streaming date on Max has yet been announced. The Hollywood Reporter first reported the shift in plans.\n\nThe move is a humbling acknowledgement that Costner's big theatrical gamble for his decadeslong passion project has failed to catch on with audiences. The first chapter of \"Horizon,\" which debuted in May at the Cannes Film Festival, cost some $100 million to make, making its path to profitability extremely challenging if not impossible. Costner put some of his own money into it, and has already begun shooting a third installment of what he envisions will ultimately be four movies.\n\nWhen asked in May about the movies hitting theaters in quick succession, Costner said, \"The studio wanted to try that. I knew this was going to come out fairly quickly, like every four or five months. That may have been easier. But this is something they feel like people can remember the first one and it can tie into the second one.\"\n\nCostner, who directed, co-wrote and co-stars in the films, had been trying to make \"Horizon\" for more than 30 years. While releasing the film, Costner confirmed his exit from the hit series \"Yellowstone.\" The ultimate destination of \"Horizon,\" he acknowledged, was always going to be on TV.\n\n\"They're going to break this up into a hundred pieces, you know what I mean?\" said Costner. \"After four of these, they're going to have 13, 14 hours of film and they're going to turn into 25 hours of TV, and they're going to do whatever they're going to do. That's just the way we live in our life but they'll also exist in this form. And that was important for me, to make sure that happened.

Decision to switch up release plan was made to grow the audience for franchise. Costner's multi-million dollar investment in the four-part saga has uncertain future.\n\nKevin Costner's next big Western won't be wrangling up seats at the box office after all, at least not for the foreseeable future. Costner's Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 2 has been pulled from its upcoming theatrical release calendar and will not bow in theaters on Aug. 16 after all, according to The Hollywood Reporter. This decision comes after the first chapter in the franchise, released this past June, significantly underperformed at the box office.\n\nThe decision to pull Horizon Chapter 2 from theaters was made by distributor New Line Cinemas and Costner's production company, Territory Pictures, according to THR, after numerous discussions. Instead of sticking to the theatrical release date this August, the choice was made to \"switch-up\" the release plan to allow the first chapter of the film to grow a larger audience. As part of this decision, the first film, Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1 will debut on video on demand beginning on July 16. Said Territory Pictures in a statement:\n\n\"The audience response to Horizon, and enthusiasm for seeing our story continue in Horizon 2, has been incredibly gratifying. Kevin made this film for people who love movies and who wanted to go on a journey. The support that we have received from film fans, and the theater owners, as they experience the first chapter of this saga only serves to reinforce our belief in them and the films that we have made, and we thank them for coming on board for the ride. We welcome the opportunity for that window to be expanded as we know it will only serve to enhance the experience of seeing Horizon 2.\"\n\n'Chapter 1' of 'Horizon' Underperformed at the Box Office\n\nThe choice to shift away from a theatrical release is not totally surprising for the franchise, given the significant underperformance at the box office of Chapter 1. The film, intended to be the first in a massive, four-part Western undertaking, was directed by Costner, who also starred in the film alongside Sienna Miller and Sam Worthington. However, the film, which was made for a reported $100 million, has generated just over $24 million at the global box office. Its dismal opening weekend brought in just $11 million.\n\nIt is unclear where the franchise will go from here, as Costner has poured millions of his own dollars into funding the four-part saga, and work on the third installment was already underway as of earlier this year. No release window for Chapter 3 or Chapter 4 has been revealed, though Warner Bros. and New Line notably have not acquired the distribution rights for these installments.\n\nHorizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1 is in theaters now.

However, with the first film having a $100 million-plus price tag, they're putting a break on the wagon for the next installment release because the first film will debut at home on Premium VOD on July 16. It will give viewers time to watch Chapter 1 from the comfort of their homes, which might be best considering the film is over three hours long.\n\nA New Line spokesperson said, \"Territory Pictures and New Line Cinema have decided not to release Horizon: Chapter 2 on August 16 in order to give audiences a greater opportunity to discover the first installment of Horizon over the coming weeks, including on PVOD and MAX. We thank our exhibition partners for their continued support as moviegoers across the US discover the films in its theatrical run.\"\n\nTerritory Pictures also released a statement saying, \"The audience response to Horizon, and enthusiasm for seeing our story continue in Horizon 2, has been incredibly gratifying.

In the second weekend, it dropped massively to $5.4 million, earning a 10-day domestic total of $22 million. Beyond that, it took a hit overseas, making only $3 million.\n\nWith Chapter 2 costing just as much to make, it's a gamble to pull it from theaters in August, but hopefully, it will give them a chance to gain more of an audience. After all, if nobody is going to see Chapter 1, surely they won't be interested in buying tickets for the next installment.\n\nThe film's initial hope was that Costner would play a big part in the Yellowstone audience and be enthusiastic about Horizon.

Many cinemas had offered consumers the chance to buy advance tickets for Chapter 2; they will now have to be refunded.\n\nThe Horizon series marks a major gamble for Costner, who put $38 million of his own money into Chapter 1 and funded the rest with the help of two mystery investors and by selling off foreign rights. New Line and Warners agreed to distribute and market the first two movies for a fee, with Costner ponying up for the marketing. Costner intends on making four films.\n\nHorizon Chapter 1, sporting a running time of three hours and one-minute, opened to just $11 million over the June 28-30 weekend. It was an alarming debut for the $100 million movie, which was hampered by a poor B- CinemaScore and tepid reviews (it has a 43 percent critics' rating on Rotten Tomatoes). It tumbled 51 percent in its second weekend to $5.4 million for a 10-day domestic total of $22 million. Worse, it's earned less than $3 million overseas.\n\nChapter 2 likewise cost roughly $100 million to make. Costner's team indicated last week that he intends to resume shooting Chapter 3 in August.\n\nCostner is known for his confidence, but even he shocked Hollywood when he announced he would direct for the first time in decades and make four Horizon movies chronicling the great migration West during the Civil War era. In April, Warner Bros. signed on as a distributor and announced the unprecedented plan to release the first two films less than two months apart. Costner was so invested, that he left his hit show Yellowstone amid his Horizon commitments.\n\nCostner believed his film would strike a nerve in America's heartland -- just as Yellowstone has -- and while it indeed played best in the mountain regions, Midwest, South and South central states, it so far has failed to galvanize his fans or Yellowstone viewers to the desired degree.\n\nThe marketing campaign crafted by Warner Bros. centered heavily on Costner, who toured across the country, as well as premiering the film at the Cannes Film Festival. The studio also leveraged sister companies that are part of Warner Bros. Discovery, including TNT sporting events and TCM.\n\nSo far, there's no word as to when Horizon Chapter 2 will return to the theatrical calendar.

I believe in the big screen. I believe in that experience. I also believe in what will come to your television. You know, I'm not one of those guys that has a director's cut. The f****** movie I make is the director's cut.'\n\nThe Dances with Wolves star - who is worth an estimated $250million - said: 'I'm not a fool, but I'm not afraid.\n\n'I will own this movie the rest of my life. So will my family. And movies are a lot more than their opening weekend. They have value throughout their life, and I will own this movie throughout my life.\n\nHorizon Chapter 1 was released in the United States on June 28, 2024, while Chapter 2 was due for theatrical release on August 16, 2024 - but the first instalment has been slammed by critics and failed to ignite at the box office - after Costner's high-profile Yellowstone exit\n\n'And people will find it. And when they do, whether it's opening weekend or not, they're going to find a quality. They're going to find a story that they're going to want to revisit or share with someone. And that's the power of a movie to me.'\n\n'My hope is that I get this money back, but you know what, I'm not going to fall apart if it (doesn't happen).\n\n'I'll lose some things that I had valued, but they're just things I've kept. I should add, I don't want to have to ever do this again. But I don't live my life in fear.'\n\nChapter 3 of the film saga started shooting in May 2024. Chapter 4 is in development.\n\nHorizon earned a 10-minute standing ovation from the audience following its premiere screening at the 77th Cannes Film Festival last month.\n\nIt has a star-studded ensemble cast in addition to Costner with Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Jena Malone, Giovanni Ribisi, Ella Hunt, Danny Huston and Luke Wilson also sharing the screen.\n\nHowever, the film has received some scathing reviews and a very low score on Rotten Tomatoes, with just a 38 per cent score on the Tomatometer - the rating system used on the film critique website.\n\nCostner financed the film himself, admitting to putting $38 million of his own funds into the project after spending decades trying to find a studio to make the film.\n\nHe even took out a loan against his Santa Barbara home after trying unsuccessfully to make it for more than 30 years.\n\nThe film project came after his high-profile exit from Yellowstone - he played John Dutton in the drama (pictured with Luke Grimes)\n\nCostner previously revealed in June 2022 that he planned on making four Horizon films in all, shot back-to-back.\n\nIt's the fourth time Costner has directed a film in his long career, which also includes following Dances With Wolves (1990), The Postman (1990) and Open Range (2003).\n\nCostner has achieved massive success with his work, including his directorial debut, Dances with Wolves (1990), which won an astounding seven Academy Awards from 12 nominations including Best Picture and Best Director.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily

It only made $11 million its opening weekend off a $100 million budget and subsequent weekends made significantly less. Chapter 2 was set for an August 16th release, but according to The Hollywood Reporter Costner's company Territory Pictures and New Line agreed to pull the film from its release to give audiences a longer chance to discover Chapter 2. They already began notifying cinemas of the change before making the announcement.\n\nHorizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1 will still play in theatres, but to help bolster its audience it will be released on digital video and streaming services on July 16th. A release on Max, the streaming service owned by New Line's parent company Warner Bros. Discovery, is inevitable but unknown if it will be available on Max on July 16th as well or on a later date.\n\n\"Territory Pictures and New Line Cinema have decided not to release Horizon: Chapter 2 on August 16 in order to give audiences a greater opportunity to discover the first installment of Horizon over the coming weeks, including on PVOD and MAX. We thank our exhibition partners for their continued support as moviegoers across the US discover the film in its theatrical run,\" New Line said to THR.\n\n\"The audience response to Horizon, and enthusiasm for seeing our story continue in Horizon 2, has been incredibly gratifying,\" Costner's Territory Pictures said. \"Kevin made this film for people who love movies and who wanted to go on a journey. The support that we have received from film fans, and the theater owners, as they experience the first chapter of this saga only serves to reinforce our belief in them and the films that we have made, and we thank them for coming on board for the ride. We welcome the opportunity for that window to be expanded as we know it will only serve to enhance the experience of seeing Horizon 2.\"\n\nBoth Horizon chapters were made for $100 million each with Costner fronting much of his own money to the budgets. These films have been a big passion project for him, enough so that its part of the reason why he left Yellowstone and will not return for its final season when it premieres this fall. Costner has intended to make four films total in his Horizon saga with THR noting he plans to resume production on Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 3 in August.\n\nAcademy Award-winning visionary filmmaker Kevin Costner directs New Line Cinema's vast \"Horizon: An American Saga\" Chapters One and Two, a multi-faceted chronicle covering the Civil War expansion and settlement of the American West. A story of America too big for one film, this true cinematic event also stars Costner, who co-writes with Jon Baird (\"The Explorers Guild\") and produces through his Territory Pictures.\n\nIn the great tradition of Warner Bros. Pictures' iconic Westerns, \"Horizon: An American Saga\" explores the lure of the Old West and how it was won -- and lost -- through the blood, sweat and tears of many. Spanning the four years of the Civil War, from 1861 to 1865, Costner's ambitious cinematic adventure will take audiences on an emotional journey across a country at war with itself, experienced through the lens of families, friends and foes all attempting to discover what it truly means to be the United States of America.\n\nHorizon: An American Saga stars Kevin Costner, Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Jena Malone, Owen Crow Shoe, Tatanka Means, Ella Hunt, Tim Guinee, Danny Huston, Colin Cunningham, Scott Haze, Tom Payne, Abbey Lee, Michael Rooker, Will Patton, Georgia MacPhail, Douglas Smith, Luke Wilson, Isabelle Fuhrman, Jamie Campbell Bower, Alejandro Edda, Was\u00e9 Winyan Chief, Michael Anganaro, Angus Macfadyen, Jon Beavers, Alex Nibley, Kathleen Quinlan, Etienne Kellici, Amos Jason Charging Cloud, Bodhi Okuma Linton, Gregory Cruz, James Russo, Jeff Fahey, David O'Hara, Chris Conner, Leroy M.

The Hollywood Reporter shared that the second movie in the planned four-part series will no longer hit theaters on August 16th.\n\nWhy? Well, to be frank, it's because the saga's first chapter performed so poorly at the box office. Horizon's maiden voyage at the movies only made $11 million in its opening weekend. That's obviously not good considering that Costner has put forth $38 million of his own money for this passion project, and the first film's budget came in around $100 million.\n\nIt was a little risky to plan and basically go ahead and execute a four-part movie series before giving audiences a chance to see if they like it. With the struggles of \"Chapter One,\" Costner and his movie crew have opted to pull \"Chapter Two\" from the release calendar. According to the reports, the 69-year-old actor and director sat down with Territory Pictures and their distribution partner New Line Cinema to make the decision to delay the second film.\n\nThe hope is that pushing back \"Chapter Two\" will give audiences more time to discover and appreciate \"Chapter One.\" That plan might be as ambitious as the original plan to do four movies in total, considering moviegoers knew where to find the first chapter of Horizon, but they just chose not to go see it.\n\nA statement about the decision from a New Line Cinema spokesperson read:\n\n\"Territory Pictures and New Line Cinema have decided not to release Horizon: Chapter 2 on August 16 in order to give audiences a greater opportunity to discover the first installment of Horizon over the coming weeks, including on PVOD and MAX. We thank our exhibition partners for their continued support as moviegoers across the US discover the film in its theatrical run.\"\n\nSo now the success of the rest of the saga seems to hang in the balance of... video-on-demand and streaming? Those that are interested in seeing \"Chapter One\" will be able to do so from home as soon as July 16th, when the movie becomes available through PVOD. Maybe that's where Costner's passion project should have gone in the first place?\n\nFrom the sounds of it though, this isn't Costner and his movie studio giving up, but rather changing course. Another statement from Territory Pictures spoke positively about Horizon: An American Saga and the potential sequels:\n\n\"The audience response to Horizon, and enthusiasm for seeing our story continue in Horizon 2, has been incredibly gratifying.

The studio had planned an unusually fast back-to-back release for the two \"Horizon\" films. But after the first chapter collected a modest $23 million in its first two weeks in theaters, the distributor pivoted.\n\n\"Territory Pictures and New Line Cinema have decided not to release 'Horizon: Chapter 2' on August 16 in order to give audiences a greater opportunity to discover the first installment of 'Horizon' over the coming weeks,\" a spokesperson for New Line said in a statement.\n\nFor now, the release of \"Chapter 2\" will be marked TBD on the theatrical calendar. The first \"Horizon,\" which opened in theaters on June 28, will land on premium on-demand July 16. No streaming date on Max has yet been announced. The Hollywood Reporter first reported the shift in plans.\n\nThe move is a humbling acknowledgement that Costner's big theatrical gamble for his decadeslong passion project has failed to catch on with audiences. The first chapter of \"Horizon,\" which debuted in May at the Cannes Film Festival, cost some $100 million to make, making its path to profitability extremely challenging if not impossible. Costner put some of his own money into it, and has already begun shooting a third installment of what he envisions will ultimately be four movies.\n\nWhen asked in May about the movies hitting theaters in quick succession, Costner said, \"The studio wanted to try that. I knew this was going to come out fairly quickly, like every four or five months. That may have been easier. But this is something they feel like people can remember the first one and it can tie into the second one.\"\n\nCostner, who directed, co-wrote and co-stars in the films, had been trying to make \"Horizon\" for more than 30 years. While releasing the film, Costner confirmed his exit from the hit series \"Yellowstone.\" The ultimate destination of \"Horizon,\" he acknowledged, was always going to be on TV.\n\n\"They're going to break this up into a hundred pieces, you know what I mean?\" said Costner. \"After four of these, they're going to have 13, 14 hours of film and they're going to turn into 25 hours of TV, and they're going to do whatever they're going to do. That's just the way we live in our life but they'll also exist in this form. And that was important for me, to make sure that happened. And I was the one who paid for it.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The summer box office has been a story of some highs and some very low lows, depending on what studio is up to bat. Warner Bros. is one of those studios that can't seem to find a film that isn't either a massive hit or a spectacular failure. There is a middle ground, and while its competition might be finding it, they are having a hard time. June ended with another massive stumble for the studio, which has some consequences further down the line. The release of Horizon: An American Saga and splitting it into two movies would always be a gamble, considering how audiences respond to Westerns. They either bring in a massive audience, or no one goes to see them. Western films are also expensive to make, and now, less than two weeks after the release of Chapter 1, the release of Chapter 2 is unknown. According to a report by The Hollywood Reporter, Horizon: An American Saga: Chapter 2 has been pulled from its planned mid-August release date with no new release date announced.\n\n\"Territory Pictures and New Line Cinema have decided not to release Horizon: Chapter 2 on August 16 in order to give audiences a greater opportunity to discover the first installment of Horizon over the coming weeks, including on PVOD and MAX. We thank our exhibition partners for their continued support as moviegoers across the US discover the film in its theatrical run,\" a New Line spokesperson said.\n\nAdded Territory Pictures in a separate statement, \"The audience response to Horizon, and enthusiasm for seeing our story continue in Horizon 2, has been incredibly gratifying. Kevin made this film for people who love movies and who wanted to go on a journey. The support that we have received from film fans and the theater owners as they experience the first chapter of this saga only serves to reinforce our belief in them and the films that we have made, and we thank them for coming on board for the ride. We welcome the opportunity for that window to be expanded as we know it will only serve to enhance the experience of seeing Horizon 2.\"\n\nWe can expect that the theatrical window for Chapter 1 is about to get a lot shorter if at all possible, considering the plan appears to be attempting to build an audience through streaming and hoping they like the movie enough to turn out for the second film. At the time of writing, Chapter 1 has only made $23.4 million at the worldwide box office with a rumored budget of about $100 million before marketing for both films. Critically, the film is more fairing great, with Chapter 1 currently sitting at 47% on Rotten Tomatoes. There weren't any promotional screenings of the movie in many markets, neither closed nor open to the public, which could have helped drum up some momentum at the box office. Maybe the Yellowstone audience Kevin Costner thought would show up for this film will show up once it hits streaming, but those proposed Chapters 3 and 4 are looking less likely by the day.\n\nAcademy Award-winning visionary filmmaker Kevin Costner directs New Line Cinema's vast Horizon: An American Saga Chapters One and Two, a multi-faceted chronicle covering the Civil War expansion and settlement of the American West. A story of America too big for one film, this true cinematic event also stars Costner, who co-writes with Jon Baird (The Explorers Guild) and produces through his Territory Pictures.\n\nIn the great tradition of Warner Bros. Pictures' iconic Westerns, Horizon: An American Saga explores the lure of the Old West and how it was won -- and lost -- through the blood, sweat, and tears of many. Spanning the four years of the Civil War, from 1861 to 1865, Costner's ambitious cinematic adventure will take audiences on an emotional journey across a country at war with itself, experienced through the lens of families, friends and foes all attempting to discover what it truly means to be the United States of America.\n\nCostner, Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, and Giovanni Ribisi star alongside an impressive ensemble cast that includes Abbey Lee, Will Patton, Jena Malone, Michael Rooker, Danny Huston, Luke Wilson, Jeff Fahey, Isabelle Fuhrman, Ella Hunt, David O'Hara, Owen Crow Shoe, Tatanka Means, Tim Guinee, Scott Haze, Tom Payne, Alejandro Edda, James Russo, Jon Beavers, Jaime Campbell Bower, Michael Anganaro, and more.\n\nNew Line Cinema and Territory Pictures Present a Territory Pictures production, a Kevin Costner Film, Horizon: An American Saga. The film will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures in theaters Across North America, the first was released on June 28, 2024, the second on currently doesn't have a release date, and in select international markets -- Spain and UK on those same respective dates, and Holland and Italy on 4 July.", "source": {"uri": "bleedingcool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleeding Cool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kaitlyn_booth@bleedingcool.com", "name": "Kaitlyn Booth", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Costner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Costner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Line_Cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Line Cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Western (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video on demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatanka_Means", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tatanka Means"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Edda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alejandro Edda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yellowstone (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Pictures", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Kevin made this film for people who love movies and wanted to take a journey. The support we have received from moviegoers and theater owners as they discover the first chapter of this saga only strengthens our belief in them and our films, and we thank them for agreeing to join us on this journey. We welcome the opportunity to expand this window, because we know it will only serve to enhance the experience of seeing Horizon 2.\"\n\nWarner Bros., New Line's parent company, began notifying theater owners of the drastic, last-minute change Wednesday morning. Many theaters had offered consumers the opportunity to purchase advance tickets for Chapter 2; they will now have to be reimbursed.\n\nTHE Horizon The series represents a major gamble for Costner, who has invested $38 million of his own money in Chapter 1 and financed the rest with the help of two mysterious investors and by selling foreign rights. New Line and Warner agreed to distribute and market the first two films for a fee, with Costner paying for marketing. Costner intends to make four films in total.\n\nHorizon: Chapter 1with a runtime of three hours and one minute, grossed just $11 million at the box office over the weekend of June 28-30. It was an alarming start for the $100 million film, which was hampered by a poor B- CinemaScore and lukewarm reviews (it has a 43% rating on Rotten Tomatoes). It fell 51% in its second weekend to $5.4 million for a 10-day total of $22 million in the United States. Worse yet, it grossed less than $3 million overseas.\n\nCostner is known for his self-confidence, but despite this, he shocked Hollywood when he announced that he would direct for the first time in decades and make four films. Horizon films chronicling the great migration to the West during the Civil War. In April, Warner Bros. signed a distribution deal and announced the unprecedented plan to release the first two films within two months of each other. Costner was so invested that he left his hit series Yellowstone in the middle of his Horizon commitments.\n\nCostner believed his film would strike a chord in the heart of America, just as Yellowstone a - and while he has indeed played better in the mountain regions, the Midwest, the South and the South-Central states, he has so far failed to galvanize his fans or Yellowstone viewers to the desired degree, and in particular Yellowstone fans aged 18-44. The film, unsurprisingly, is particularly aimed at older audiences, with the majority of the audience being over 45 (older consumers aren't known for rushing out to see a movie right away).\n\nWarner Bros.' marketing campaign focused primarily on Costner, who toured the country and premiered the film at the Cannes Film Festival. The studio also tapped sister companies that are part of Warner Bros. Discovery, including TNT Sports Events, such as MLB and NBA games, and TCM, where Costner appeared as a guest programmer. There were also extensive screenings in many cities, as well as tours of military bases.\n\nSo far it is not known when Horizon: Chapter 2 will return to theaters.

While it's been reported that the movie was pulled -that's a strong word which indicates Chapter 2 has no theatrical prospects. Again, no decision have been made.

The first movie opened to $11M and counts a running domestic of $23.4M. While that gross is par for the course for a western at the box office, the pricetag is pretty steep. Costner's previously directed 2003 western, Open Range, opened to $14M and finaled at $58.3M at the domestic B.O.

Horizon had a disappointing theatrical opening, with $11 million in its first weekend and weak ticket sales. VOD release may help boost ticket sales for the Kevin Costner-directed sequel and widen the film's exposure.\n\nAfter a disappointing theatrical opening, Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1 is coming to video-on-demand (VOD) much sooner than anyone expected. Directed, co-written and starring Kevin Costner, the Western drama was the first entry in an epic that tells the story of America's Western expansion in the Civil War era, but appears ready to go to digital. According to a listing with Prime Video, Horizon (which opened in theaters on June 28) is coming to VOD on July 15, 2024, less than a month after its release.\n\nSeveral hours after the release was announced, however, Prime Video updated the listing, removing the date and merely stating \"Release date coming soon.\" While the date appears correct, it is likely Warner Bros. did not want to discourage ticket sales with the film still in theaters, so the release date was removed. The film made just $11 million in its opening weekend and about $23 million at the box office in its first 11 days, against a reported $100 million budget for the entire production.\n\nHorizon 2/5\n\nHorizon centers around fictional characters and takes place in pre- and post-Civil War America, and details the exploration of the American West. Depicting a twelve-year span, the movies feature an ensemble cast portraying various characters and their experiences pioneering into new territory from their homes.\n\nRelease Date June 28, 2024 Director Kevin Costner Cast Kevin Costner , Sienna Miller , Jena Malone , Luke Wilson , Sam Worthington , Michael Rooker , Thomas Haden Church , Jamie Campbell Bower , Isabelle Fuhrman Main Genre Western\n\nThe film is Costner's latest passion project, and his first theatrical Western in over two decades. In the meantime, he returned to the genre on television, with 2012's Hatfields & McCoys and the Taylor Sheridan hit series Yellowstone. The Oscar winner recently left Yellowstone in the midst of its final season after scheduling conflicts and other on-set issues caused a rift.\n\nWhile quick turnarounds for films from theater to VOD are becoming the norm these days, Horizon's move to digital from the theater in less than a month is unusual and does little to shake the \"box office bomb\" talk that the film has received. However, the move may be advantageous in the long run, as the second chapter of the film series is releasing in August. A VOD release could widen the film's exposure and encourage ticket sales for the sequel.\n\nHorizon Has Received a Mixed Response From Critics Close\n\nDespite receiving a rousing standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival, Horizon has received mixed reviews from critics. The film has a 48% Tomatometer score from critics on Rotten Tomatoes. However, viewers have rated it at 71%, raising hopes the film will do better at home, and giving Chapter 1 a month-long head start on home video before Chapter 2 opens on August 16 could generate positive word-of-mouth.\n\nRelated Horizon: An American Saga Would've Worked Better as a TV Show\n\nKevin Costner's ambitious directorial project may have gotten a standing ovation at Cannes, but some still think Horizon should have been a series.\n\nHorizon had an uphill battle to find an audience even before it opened. Westerns are not the most popular genre in theaters in recent years. The film's three-hour runtime and multiple storylines did not win over moviegoers. The response to the film led star Michael Rooker to tell younger audiences to \"watch real cinema\" over the short videos that dominate social media. With a reported $100 million budget, and poor ticket sales overseas, Horizon will need a cinematic miracle to make a profit.\n\nIn addition to Costner and Rooker, Horizon stars Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Jena Malone, Owen Crow Shoe, Tatanka Means, Danny Huston, Tom Payne, Will Patton, and Giovanni Ribisi.\n\nHorizon Chapter 1 is currently in theaters. Chapter 2 opens in theaters on August 16.", "source": {"uri": "movieweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Movieweb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The plan was for the second chapter in the sprawling story to be released six weeks later.\n\nBut thanks to paltry box office returns, that plan has been scuttled. On Wednesday, New Line Cinema, a subsidiary of Warner Bros., said it was canceling the theatrical release of \"Horizon: An American Saga -- Chapter 2,\" which was scheduled to debut in theaters on Aug. 16.\n\nThe first chapter, which cost $100 million, made $11 million in its opening weekend and has generated just $22.6 million over all. Mr. Costner planned for the saga, about the settling of the West after the Civil War, to consist of four chapters, and tickets to the first two chapters were made available at the same time.

As such, upon reading the breaking news about Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 2 being taken off the 2024 movie release calendar, I was ready to hit the metaphorical trail for my own ranting revenge. However, the announcement comes with an explanation, and as a fan of Kevin Costner's developing western epic, I kind of agree with this decision in context.\n\nFor anyone that's been following this story, Horizon's less than optimal opening weekend saw only $11 million earned domestically. The estimated worldwide take at the moment seems to be sitting at $23.4 million against an estimated $100 million budget for the first two chapters.\n\nThis has seemingly prompted the announcement that Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1 is heading to PVOD rental very soon - specifically on July 16.

For those of us who are already amped for the next chapter - much like I was when writing my Horizon: An American Saga Chapter 1 review - the wait is going to be the hardest part. But at the same time, just by looking at the statement above, I think Warner Bros.' move to yank Horizon: Chapter 2 from the release schedule isn't from a lack of confidence.\n\nRather, I think the studio is starting to understand its audience and is making a quick pivot to ensure Horizon's future has the best shot possible at success in the future. That much is especially true when you consider the fact that, as of this moment, Horizon is still very much a theatrical experience.

Costner later denied these reports in a GQ interview, instead stating he had a long wait for his \"Yellowstone\" scripts which left him little time before he had to start production on \"Horizon.\" Costner lamented the drama in an interview with People, stating he was \"disappointed that nobody on their side... ever stepped up to defend what it was I actually did for them.\"\n\nKevin Costner's 'Horizon 2' Pulled From August Release in Theaters (Exclusive) (The Hollywood Reporter)\n\nTrouble On Kevin Costner's 'Horizon': His Big Post-'Yellowstone' Gamble Could Go Bust (Forbes)\n\nKevin Costner's Big 'Horizon' Gamble Struggles With $4.1 Million Debut -- As 'A Quiet Place' Hits Record (Forbes)", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_(British_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horizon (British TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Costner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Costner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_Office_Mojo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Box Office Mojo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Barbara, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Barbara, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yellowstone (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slate (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannes Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rotten Tomatoes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Screenplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Sheridan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Sheridan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/668eea530defea63e5f87e32/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2933,1650,x0,y213,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722441", "eventUri": "eng-9722441", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-16", "textStart": 112, "textEnd": 119}], "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Kevin made this film for people who love movies and who wanted to go on a journey.\n\n'The support that we have received from film fans, and the theater owners, as they experience the first chapter of this saga only serves to reinforce our belief in them and the films that we have made, and we thank them for coming on board for the ride.\n\n'We welcome the opportunity for that window to be expanded as we know it will only serve to enhance the experience of seeing Horizon 2.'\n\nAccording to the outlet, New Line's parent company, Warner Brothers, have started notifying cinemas of the change - as many had offered advanced tickets for the sequel.\n\nHorizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1 premiered at Cannes Film Festival earlier this year, to a 10-minute standing ovation.\n\nKevin wrote, directed and starred in the epic, which focuses on a family during the expansion of the American West - alongside Sienna and co.\n\nHe first wrote the initial story in 1988 and then decided to revamp the production into a mammoth four-part saga - he began filming the third chapter before appearing at Cannes.\n\nThe star put his money where his mouth is and put around $38million of his own money into the project.\n\n'I know they say I've got $20million of my own money in this movie,' he recently told GQ of the financial risk. 'It's not true. I've got now about $38million in the film. That's the truth. That's the real number.'\n\n'I haven't spent my life trying to make my pile grow bigger,' he vowed. 'I guess I could buy apartments and I could buy McDonald's and I could buy a bunch of things and just grow, grow, grow, grow,\n\n'That's the message I want my kids to understand about who I am: that I do what I believe in.\n\n'I have fear like everybody else.

The somewhat embarrassing news for Costner doesn't seem to be bothering him. Yet.\n\n\"I've lived with movies and what happens to them on their opening weekend,\" Costner told Entertainment Weekly of the flop. \"If we put so much pressure on that, we're bound to be disappointed. I'm really happy that 'Horizon' looks like what it's supposed to look like, and that's the way it'll look the rest of its life. And that's really important to me in this process.\"\n\nDespite earning around $22 million in North American sales, Costner kind of hinged the future of his career and reputation on the franchise earning back it's budget. The cost was unclear, with reports ranging from $50 million to $100 million. Since falling out with the creator of his career-reviving Western series \"Yellowstone,\" Costner has upset a lot of people, especially his fans.\n\nWith just half a season left, Costner's ego and alleged \"scheduling issues\" are apparently stopping him from finishing his role as John Dutton -- arguably the best he's ever played.

After a dismal opening for Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1 earlier this month, the sequel's fate remains in limbo. This unfortunate news delivers a harsh blow to the adult-focused film market, particularly for audience demos in the 50+ range. Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1 continues to screen in theaters, though a July 16 digital release date for the film is already on the horizon.\n\nThere are no plans to port Horizon: An American Saga -- Chapter 2 to Max, and theatrical plans for the film's release remain uncertain. Whispers around the Hollywood water cooler say Chapter 2 could get a day-and-date release in theaters and on digital, but nothing is concrete. Unsubstantiated reports say the movie is getting pulled outright, but that claim has no validity. It sounds like madness, but theaters could have been a poor choice of venue for Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1. While the film's epic scope plays well on the silver screen, much of Costner's Yellowstone audience is comfortable watching the actor do his thing on television. Going to the movies is hella expensive nowadays, and folks might not want to pay high-end prices to see a multi-part Western in cinemas.\n\nIt's also a possibility that some Yellowstone fans feel betrayed by Costner's abrupt exit from Taylor Sheridan's Yellowstone. Costner's absence from the fan-favorite program created chaos on the set, delaying the release of a new season (now the final season) and changing the story's trajectory. It's not impossible to think Costner's falling out affected audiences, leaving them with a sour taste in their mouths and unwilling to hop along to his latest project. It's a bit of a stretch, I'll give you that, but if the entertainment industry has taught me anything, it's that fans will often protest when expectations become altered.\n\nHowever, the loss of a theatrical release date for Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 2 could be as simple as the first film's underperformance scaring away the option to continue with the original release plan.\n\nWhat do you think about Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 2 losing its theatrical release date?

Don't get me wrong: The mediocre white men among us aren't completely useless, and Costner has made some fine movies in his time. He's responsible for four of my favorite sports films: Tin Cup, For the Love of the Game, Bull Durham, and Field of Dreams.\n\nThe problem with Costner is when he doesn't have anyone around to say, \"Hey, Kev: Maybe this isn't such a great idea.\" That's how we ended up with Waterworld, not to mention The Postman, a three-hour post-apocalyptic film about a goddamn mail carrier. To his credit, few people flame out as hard as Kevin Costner, and he's also made several great movies that never got the due they deserved (A Perfect World, The Company Men, The Upside of Anger, to name a few).\n\nWith Horizon: An American Saga, however, Kevin Costner seriously overestimated interest in Kevin Costner. The star of Open Range thought he was the reason Yellowstone has been so popular (he's a reason, but not the reason), and so decided he'd make not one but four movies in a genre that hasn't seen a box-office hit in America in a very long time and that almost never performs well overseas. N one outside the US gives a shit about Westerns, less so about a country with which the rest of the world has had about enough. Try selling a 12-hour saga about the Old West to France and Japan, and good luck with that.\n\nCostner -- who put tens of millions of his own dollars into this film and somehow coerced a big investor to put $50 million more toward his passion project -- has officially struck out. The first part, which had a budget of around $100 million, has stalled at the box office with around $22 million and has already been scheduled for release on VOD on July 16th, two weeks after its theatrical release.\n\nCostner's ambitious plan was to sell a lot of tickets, gain even more viewers from VOD, and then release part two in August, capitalizing on the buzz of the first film. That didn't work, so now Horizon: An American Saga -- Chapter 2 has been pulled from theaters.\n\n\"Territory Pictures and New Line Cinema have decided not to release Horizon: Chapter 2 on August 16 in order to give audiences a greater opportunity to discover the first installment of Horizon over the coming weeks, including on PVOD and MAX. We thank our exhibition partners for their continued support as moviegoers across the US discover the film in its theatrical run,\" the folks behind the movie said in a statement. Translation: \"We're cutting our losses.\"\n\nI don't expect that part two will ever see theaters, and part three -- which is already reportedly filming -- will probably be quickly shut down before investors lose yet another shirt to Costner's ego. One thing I'll say about Costner, however, is this: Don't count him out.

Chapter 1 underperformed at the box office, necessitating a longer hiatus between movies. Chapter 2 could still suffer from a poor critical and commercial reception in spite of this delay.\n\nA major change for Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 2 belies a mistake made by Kevin Costner. Costner, who recently departed the cast of the Taylor Sheridan neo-Western series Yellowstone, is the co-writer, director, and star of the Western movie franchise, which is intended to span four installments. The massive ensemble cast of the project also includes Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Michael Rooker, Danny Huston, Jena Malone, Abbey Lee, Jamie Campbell Bower, Giovanni Ribisi, Will Patton, Luke Wilson, Ella Hunt, and Isabelle Fuhrman.\n\nBetween them, the first two movies have a combined production budget of $100 million, with more than $20 million of that total coming from Costner himself. The upcoming Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 2 is the only other completed installment considering the fact that Chapter 3 is in production and Chapter 4 is in development. However, the movie has been removed from the schedule following the release of Chapter 1 on June 28. The original plan was for the sequel to premiere just seven weeks later, on August 16.\n\nRelated Horizon: An American Saga Absolutely Should've Been A TV Show Instead Of Movie Franchise\n\nThe disappointing box office returns and critic reviews for Horizon: An American Saga prove that Kevin Costner chose the wrong format for his series.\n\nHorizon: An American Saga 2 Releasing So Soon After Chapter 1 Was Always A Bad Idea The Market Was Already Oversaturated With The Kevin Costner Franchise Close\n\nThis swift cancellation following the Horizon: An American Saga- Chapter 1 release was perhaps inevitable. There are quite a few reasons that releasing the first two movies so close together did not make sense. For one thing, the following pair of sequels are both incomplete, meaning that the franchise would be immediately unable to keep up a consistent release pattern. There is also precedent for similar movies to fail at the box office. In fact, something extremely close to this situation already happened in 1994 when the previous Kevin Costner Western Wyatt Earp premiered just six months after Tombstone.\n\nMovie Title\n\nRelease Date\n\nBudget\n\nBox Office\n\nRotten Tomatoes Critic Score\n\nRotten Tomatoes Audience Score\n\nTombstone (1993)\n\nDecember 25, 1993\n\n$25 million\n\n$73.2 million\n\n73%\n\n94%\n\nWyatt Earp (1994)\n\nJune 24, 1994\n\n$63 million\n\n$56 million\n\n32%\n\n61%\n\nThe earlier movie featured the same characters, a smaller budget, a shorter runtime, and a stronger critical reception, providing strong competition for the 1994 title. It is in large part credited for the financial failure of Kevin Costner's Wyatt Earp, which only earned $55.9 million against its $63 million budget. Another, more recent example of a similar release also shows that longer delays can pay dividends, as MaXXXine, the two-years-later sequel to 2022's X and Pearl, just earned the strongest opening weekend of the trilogy in spite of the fact that it opened in fewer theaters than either previous installment.\n\nHorizon: An American Saga's Box Office Made A Chapter 2 Delay Inevitable Horizon Has Fallen Far Short Of Its Production Budget\n\nThe underwhelming box office of Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1 was likely another huge factor in this delay. Presuming its production budget was roughly half of the movies' combined price tag, it likely needs to make $100 million or more in order to end up in the black. However, it opened to $11 million and has onlyearned roughly $23.4 million overall at the time of writing. It is an extreme unlikelihood that the movie will come anywhere close to being profitable by the end of its run.\n\nTheaters generally keep half of ticket sales, meaning that movies need to earn back twice their production budget in order to break even, without factoring in their marketing costs.\n\nThis release delay is likely meant to allow audiences time to catch up with Chapter 1 on VOD and avoid the sequel following in its financial footsteps. If the release had gone on as planned, audiences would only have been given mere weeks to catch up with the first three-hour movie. Because Chapter 2 is a direct continuation, it likely wouldn't have been inviting to newcomers, meaning that its built-in audience would have been quite small.\n\nWill Horizon: An American Saga Chapter 2 Be Successful After The Delay? The Odds Are Stacked Against The Upcoming Kevin Costner Western\n\nIt is possible that this theatrical delay will pay off as intended, allowing more audiences to find the movie and thus increase general interest in the sequel during its eventual release. This may particularly be the case for the Yellowstone audience, who are used to seeing Kevin Costner on their screens at home and may not have felt encouraged to venture out to the theaters for the first movie. However, Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1 reviews may provide a major reason why this gambit still won't work.\n\nIt seems unlikely that the sequel could be such a vast improvement\n\nAlthough audiences have given it a solidly Fresh score of 71% on Rotten Tomatoes, critics have largely been negative, giving it an official splat on the review aggregator platform with a 48% score. If Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 2 significantly improves on the original movie's score, that could provide a major enticement for skittish audiences. However, given the fact that it features the same production team as Chapter 1, it seems unlikely that the sequel could be such a vast improvement.\n\nHorizon: An American Saga- Chapter 2\n\nHorizon: An American Saga - Chapter 2 is a western drama film directed by Kevin Costner. Broken into two parts, Horizon explores the periods before and after the American Civil War, with the reconstruction and new era for Western Expansion.\n\nDirector Kevin Costner Release Date August

At 67, Schoof brings extensive experience in security and immigration. A press conference is scheduled to confirm his appointment.\n\nA former head of the Dutch spy agency and counterterrorism office was tipped Tuesday to become the Netherlands' next prime minister, leading a four-party coalition headed by Geert Wilders' hard right Party for Freedom.\n\nDick Schoof, the 67-year-old former head of the General Intelligence and Security Service and currently the top civil servant at the Ministry of Security and Justice, was meeting with the leaders of the four parties and was expected to be announced as their choice to become prime minister at a late afternoon press conference.\n\nAs well as once leading the top intelligence agency, Schoof also is a former counterterror chief in the Netherlands and ex-head of the country's Immigration and Naturalisation Service. He did not speak to the media as he took a seat at the negotiating table. A press conference was scheduled for later in the afternoon.\n\nIn a message on social platform X, Wilders congratulated Schoof and said he \"has a great track record, is nonpartisan and therefore above the parties, has integrity and is also very likeable.'' Anti-Islam lawmaker Wilders convincingly won the November election but took months to cobble together an outline coalition deal with three other parties. The four leaders are aiming to select a team of ministers to form a technocrat Cabinet over the next month. Wilders, a divisive figure who has in the past been convicted of insulting Moroccans, agreed not to become prime minister because of opposition from his coalition partners.\n\nWilders is building a coalition with outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte's centre-right People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, the populist Farmer Citizen Movement and the centrist New Social Contract party.\n\nRutte's government remains in power on a caretaker basis until the new administration is sworn in.\n\nThe initial candidate for prime minister that Wilders had in mind withdrew last week following reported allegations of his involvement in medical patent fraud.\n\nA deal published last week by the four parties outlining their policy objectives is titled \"Hope, courage and pride.\" It pledges to introduce strict measures on asylum-seekers, scrap family reunification for refugees and reduce the number of international students studying in the country.\n\n(This story has not been edited by

After nearly six months of debate within the coalition, Schoof will succeed outgoing premier Mark Rutte.\n\n\"On the recommendation of, and with the support of the parliamentary coalition leaders... I have found Mr Dick Schoof willing to be available as the intended prime minister,\" said Richard van Zwol, the official tasked with leading talks to form a new Dutch government.\n\nDespite a stunning election victory in November, far-right leader Geert Wilders gave up his ambition to lead the European Union's fifth-largest economy amid widespread unease over his anti-Islam, anti-European views.\n\nWilders and other coalition leaders asked Schoof, who originally came from the left-wing Labour party but is seen as a no-nonsense official able to tackle threats from inside the Netherlands and abroad, to take the role.\n\nSchoof will now be tasked to form a government together with Van Zwol and the four right-wing coalition partners who have 88 seats in the 150-member lower house of parliament.\n\nThis includes Wilders' Freedom Party (PVV), Rutte's Liberal Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), newcomers the New Social Contract (NSC) party and the agriculture-friendly Citizen-Farmer Movement.\n\n- 'Toughest' -\n\nThe coalition decided that the cabinet will be split in half between politicians and outside experts to implement the Netherlands' \"toughest\" immigration policy ever.\n\nSchoof told journalists at a press conference he aimed to \"decisively\" carry out the policies decided on upon two weeks ago by the coalition partners in a draft government agreement.\n\n\"This means getting a grip on migration and asylum, giving people including farmers security of living, and looking at international safety,\" he said.\n\n\"That's why I am here,\" said Schoof.\n\nIt took some six months for squabbling leaders of four political parties to clinch a deal on a government and the manifesto they released bore the hallmarks of Wilders' far-right PVV.\n\nWilders told AFP after the manifesto was released that the new government would enforce \"the most tough anti-asylum (policy) ever being implemented in the Netherlands.\"\n\nHe vowed the Netherlands would seek an opt-out from EU common policy on asylum although this received a cool reception in Brussels and it is not clear how this would work.\n\nEven Wilders admitted it would take many years and might not happen, promising instead to use Dutch law to restrict what he called an \"influx of asylum-seekers\".\n\nSchoof, who has decades of experience navigating The Hague's bureaucratic pitfalls, said he aimed to be \"a prime minister for all Dutch citizens\" when asked about carrying out Wilders' policies.\n\n\"I am going to be the prime minister. I am without a party. I don't see myself cow-towing to Mr Wilders,\" Schoof told journalists, but he stressed \"my plans for the Netherlands are those agreed upon by the coalition leaders\".\n\nCoalition parties now aimed to have a government in place before the summer, the NOS public newscaster said.\n\njhe/tw\n\nMore from this section\n\nAt least 22 dead in Memorial Day weekend storms that devastated several US

Picture: REUTERS/PIROSCHKA VAN DE WOUW\n\nAmsterdam -- Former Dutch intelligence chief and political outsider Dick Schoof said on Tuesday he will uphold the rule of law and govern for all after being proposed as prime minister of the incoming right-wing cabinet.\n\nHe said he had been asked by the four parties that will form the new government to lead it -- not only by Geert Wilders' nationalist PVV, the clear winner of the November 22 election.\n\n\"I am not affiliated to any party, I am not standing here in the name of the PVV ... I want to be the prime minister of all the Dutch,\" Schoof, who has had no previous experience in parliament or in government, told reporters.\n\nElection winner Wilders this month reached an agreement on forming the government with three other conservative parties, after ruling himself out of the top job.\n\nSchoof, 67, is the senior official at the Dutch ministry of justice, after having led the intelligence agency AIVD and antiterrorism agency NCTV for years. He was the head of the Dutch immigration service in the early 2000s.\n\nI think that, in all my positions, the common thread has always been the functioning of democratic rule of law and that will help me in my function as prime minister.\n\nDick Schoof\n\n\"I guess it will be a surprise for a lot of people that I'm standing here... It's actually also a surprise for me,\" he told reporters.\n\nIn its governing plan published on May 16, the coalition said it would aim for the \"strictest-ever asylum regime\" with stronger border controls and harsher rules for asylum seekers, setting up a potential clash with the EU before even taking office.\n\nSchoof will head a cabinet that the four parties have said would have looser ties to parliament. It could take weeks to put together, with the parties all negotiating over the portfolios and responsibilities.\n\nOnce he has formed a government, set to be the most right-wing in the Netherlands in decades, he will be sworn in by the king and officially become prime minister.\n\n\"Congratulations Dick. Dick Schoof has a great track record, is not a member of any party and thus stands above the parties, is honest and, on top of it, very friendly,\" Wilders reacted on social media X.\n\nThat government will, however, have to stick to the agreement reached by the four parties, which is aiming to secure exceptions on EU asylum and environmental rules.\n\n\"I think that, in all my positions, the common thread has always been the functioning of democratic rule of law and that will help me in my function as prime minister,\" Schoof said, adding that outgoing prime minister Mark Rutte is for him \"a form of inspiration in the way he handles things\".\n\nFar-right leader Wilders last week said he expected the new government to be operational by end-June.\n\nBesides his experience at the intelligence and antiterrorism services, Schoof has also worked on reforming the police force.\n\nHaving worked mostly on domestic policies, Schoof, a divorced father of two, does not have a high international profile.\n\nReuters", "source": {"uri": "businesslive.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessLIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I want to be the prime minister of all the Dutch,\" Schoof, who has had no previous experience in parliament or in government, told reporters.\n\nElection winner Wilders this month reached an agreement on forming the government with three other conservative parties, after ruling himself out of the top job.\n\nSchoof, 67, is currently the senior official at the Dutch ministry of justice, after having led the intelligence agency AIVD and anti-terrorism agency NCTV for years. He was the head of the Dutch immigration service in the early 2000s.\n\n\"I guess it will be a surprise for a lot of people that I'm standing here... It's actually also a surprise for me,\" he told reporters.\n\nIn its governing plan published on May 16, the coalition said it would aim for the \"strictest-ever asylum regime\" with stronger border controls and harsher rules for asylum seekers, setting up a potential clash with the EU before even taking office.\n\nSchoof will head a cabinet that the four parties have said would have looser ties to parliament. It could take weeks to put together, with the parties all negotiating over the portfolios and responsibilities.\n\nOnce he has formed a government, set to be the most right-wing in the Netherlands in decades, he will be sworn in by the king and officially become prime minister.\n\n\"Congratulations Dick. Dick Schoof has a great track record, is not a member of any party and thus stands above the parties, is honest and, on top of it, very friendly,\" Wilders reacted on social media X.\n\nThat government will, however, have to stick to the agreement reached by the four parties, which is aiming to secure exceptions on EU asylum and environmental rules.\n\n\"I think that, in all my positions, the common thread has always been the functioning of democratic rule of law and that will help me in my function as prime minister,\" Schoof said, adding that outgoing prime minister Mark Rutte is for him \"a form of inspiration in the way he handles things\".\n\nFar-right leader Wilders last week said he expected the new government to be operational by end-June.\n\nBesides his experience at the intelligence and anti-terrorism services, Schoof has also worked on reforming the police force.\n\nHaving worked mostly on domestic policies, Schoof, a divorced father of two, does not have a high international profile.", "source": {"uri": "swissinfo.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "SWI swissinfo.ch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "swi_swissinfo_ch@swissinfo.ch", "name": "Swi Swissinfo.Ch", "type":

He did not speak to the media as he took a seat at the negotiating table. A press conference was scheduled for later in the afternoon.\n\nIn a message on social platform X, Wilders congratulated Schoof and said he \"has a great track record, is nonpartisan and therefore above the parties, has integrity and is also very likeable.\"\n\nAnti-Islam lawmaker Wilders convincingly won the November election but took months to cobble together an outline coalition deal with three other parties.\n\nThe four leaders are aiming to select a team of ministers to form a technocrat Cabinet over the next month. Wilders, a divisive figure who has in the past been convicted of insulting Moroccans, agreed not to become prime minister because of opposition from his coalition partners.\n\nWilders is building a coalition with outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte's centre-right People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, the populist Farmer Citizen Movement and the centrist New Social Contract party.\n\nRutte's government remains in power on a caretaker basis until the new administration is sworn in.\n\nThe initial candidate for prime minister that Wilders had in mind withdrew last week following reported allegations of his involvement in medical patent fraud.\n\nA deal published last week by the four parties outlining their policy objectives is titled \"Hope, courage and pride.\" It pledges to introduce strict measures on asylum-seekers, scrap family reunification for refugees and reduce the number of international students studying in the country.", "source": {"uri":

Despite his lack of parliamentary or governmental experience, Schoof promises to uphold the rule of law and govern for all Dutch citizens. His cabinet aims for strict asylum policies and stronger border controls.\n\nFormer Dutch intelligence chief and political outsider Dick Schoof said on Tuesday he will uphold the rule of law and govern for all after being proposed as prime minister of the incoming right-wing cabinet. He said he had been asked by the four parties that will form the new government to lead it - not only by Geert Wilders' nationalist PVV, the clear winner of the Nov. 22 election.\n\n\"I am not affiliated to any party, I am not standing here in the name of the PVV... I want to be the prime minister of all the Dutch,\" Schoof, who has had no previous experience in parliament or in government, told reporters. Election winner Wilders this month reached an agreement on forming the government with three other conservative parties, after ruling himself out of the top job.\n\nSchoof, 67, is currently the senior official at the Dutch ministry of justice, after having led the intelligence agency AIVD and anti-terrorism agency NCTV for years. He was the head of the Dutch immigration service in the early 2000s. \"I guess it will be a surprise for a lot of people that I'm standing here... It's actually also a surprise for me,\" he told reporters.\n\nIn its governing plan published on May 16, the coalition said it would aim for the \"strictest-ever asylum regime\" with stronger border controls and harsher rules for asylum seekers, setting up a potential clash with the EU before even taking office. Schoof will head a cabinet that the four parties have said would have looser ties to parliament. It could take weeks to put together, with the parties all negotiating over the portfolios and responsibilities.\n\nOnce he has formed a government, set to be the most right-wing in the Netherlands in decades, he will be sworn in by the king and officially become prime minister. \"Congratulations Dick. Dick Schoof has a great track record, is not a member of any party and thus stands above the parties, is honest and, on top of it, very friendly,\" Wilders reacted on social media X.\n\nThat government will, however, have to stick to the agreement reached by the four parties, which is aiming to secure exceptions on EU asylum and environmental rules. \"I think that, in all my positions, the common thread has always been the functioning of democratic rule of law and that will help me in my function as prime minister,\" Schoof said, adding that outgoing prime minister Mark Rutte is for him \"a form of inspiration in the way he handles things\".\n\nFar-right leader Wilders last week said he expected the new government to be operational by end-June. Besides his experience at the intelligence and anti-terrorism services, Schoof has also worked on reforming the police force.\n\nHaving worked mostly on domestic policies, Schoof, a divorced father of two, does not have a high international profile.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Schoof", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dick Schoof"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_for_Freedom", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Party for Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geert_Wilders", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Geert Wilders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Border control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Intelligence_and_Security_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Intelligence and Security Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rutte", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Rutte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_05_2019_12_11_15_3417518.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604460", "eventUri": "eng-9604460", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-22", "textStart": 699, "textEnd": 706}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "textStart": 1514, "textEnd": 1520}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

He once led the Netherlands' AIVD domestic security service, as well as the counter-terrorism agency and the immigration service.\n\nHe said his focus on the rule of law would help him govern the Netherlands. His experience in the justice ministry may also help him navigate some of the coalition's biggest ambitions.\n\nMr Schoof said he knew Geert Wilders \"a little\" but stressed he had been appointed by four parties that had a big majority in parliament. Asked whether he or the far-right party leader would be the boss, he said: \"There is only one prime minister and that will be me.\"\n\nHe rejected outright any suggestion that he might act as if he was on Geert Wilders' leash, but admitted to being surprised by his nomination for the top job.\n\nIn a recent interview Dick Schoof was asked how the election result might affect his role in the civil service.\n\n\"It is a sign that many people do not have confidence in the government's ability to solve problems, and perhaps not in each other either,\" he told the Green Amsterdammer. \"And of course it is not the case that just because a quarter of voters back the [Freedom Party], then suddenly a quarter has got the whole thing wrong.\"\n\nAlthough he was a member of the Labour party for decades until only a few years ago, he told reporters on Tuesday he no longer felt any affinity to it.\n\nHis appointment came after the first choice for prime minister, Ronald Plasterk, had to pull out after Dutch media reports questioned his integrity.\n\nThe next step for the prospective prime minister will be to assemble a ministerial team, along with the man leading the process, Richard van Zwol.

He has years of experience on topics important to the new government: migration and security.\n\nAs a senior government official in the Justice and Security Ministry, he has been in charge of migration policies. He was previously also the head of the Dutch intelligence service and the director of the nation's immigration department.\n\nDutch coalition parties seeking to form a government six months after an election agreed on significantly reducing migration, according to a deal presented earlier this month. Schoof was a member of the Labor Party in the past but is no longer affiliated with any political party.\n\nThe policy blueprint underscores the most hard-right shift for the country in decades, as migration tops voters' concerns in Europe. Nationalist and far-right parties have moved into positions of power throughout the EU, including in Italy and Sweden.\n\nSchoof \"has a great track record, is non-partisan and is therefore above the parties,\" Wilders said in a post on X on Tuesday. Schoof \"has integrity and is also very sympathetic,\" he said. The leaders of the other three parties also endorsed the selection of Schoof.\n\nWilders' attempts to form a government have faced several setbacks since his surprise election victory in November. The far-right politician was also forced to abandon his bid to become prime minister in order to move talks forward.\n\nThe party leaders have agreed to stay out of the next Cabinet, which is expected to include a mix of ministers who are affiliated with political parties, as well as those from different fields.

Meijer\n\nAMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Former Dutch intelligence chief and political outsider Dick Schoof said on Tuesday he will uphold the rule of law and govern for all after being proposed as prime minister of the incoming right-wing cabinet.\n\nHe said he had been asked by the four parties that will form the new government to lead it - not only by Geert Wilders' nationalist PVV, the clear winner of the Nov. 22 election.\n\n\"I am not affiliated to any party, I am not standing here in the name of the PVV... I want to be the prime minister of all the Dutch,\" Schoof, who has had no previous experience in parliament or in government, told reporters.\n\nElection winner Wilders this month reached an agreement on forming the government with three other conservative parties, after ruling himself out of the top job.\n\nSchoof, 67, is currently the senior official at the Dutch ministry of justice, after having led the intelligence agency AIVD and anti-terrorism agency NCTV for years. He was the head of the Dutch immigration service in the early 2000s.\n\n\"I guess it will be a surprise for a lot of people that I'm standing here... It's actually also a surprise for me,\" he told reporters.\n\nIn its governing plan published on May 16, the coalition said it would aim for the \"strictest-ever asylum regime\" with stronger border controls and harsher rules for asylum seekers, setting up a potential clash with the EU before even taking office.\n\nSchoof will head a cabinet that the four parties have said would have looser ties to parliament. It could take weeks to put together, with the parties all negotiating over the portfolios and responsibilities.\n\nOnce he has formed a government, set to be the most right-wing in the Netherlands in decades, he will be sworn in by the king and officially become prime minister.\n\n\"Congratulations Dick. Dick Schoof has a great track record, is not a member of any party and thus stands above the parties, is honest and, on top of it, very friendly,\" Wilders reacted on social media X.\n\nThat government will, however, have to stick to the agreement reached by the four parties, which is aiming to secure exceptions on EU asylum and environmental rules.\n\n\"I think that, in all my positions, the common thread has always been the functioning of democratic rule of law and that will help me in my function as prime minister,\" Schoof said, adding that outgoing prime minister Mark Rutte is for him \"a form of inspiration in the way he handles things\".\n\nFar-right leader Wilders last week said he expected the new government to be operational by end-June.\n\nBesides his experience at the intelligence and anti-terrorism services, Schoof has also worked on reforming the police force.\n\nHaving worked mostly on domestic policies, Schoof, a divorced father of two, does not have a high international profile.\n\n(Reporting by Bart Meijer and Stephanie van den Berg, additional reporting by Benoit Van Overstraeten; Editing by Peter Graff, Sharon Singleton, Alison Williams and Nick Macfie)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Schoof, currently a senior official at the Dutch ministry of justice, has extensive experience in intelligence and anti-terrorism services. He will lead a coalition focused on stricter asylum policies.\n\nFormer Dutch intelligence chief Dick Schoof will be presented on Tuesday as the proposed prime minister of the Netherlands' incoming right-wing government.\n\nThe four parties that will form the new government, led by Geert Wilders' nationalist PVV, announced a press conference with Schoof for 1500 GMT on Tuesday. Election winner Wilders this month reached an agreement on forming the government with three other conservative parties, after ruling himself out of the top job in the cabinet.\n\nSchoof, 67, is currently the senior official at the Dutch ministry of justice, after having led the country's intelligence agency AIVD and anti-terrorism agency NCTV for years. He was the head of the Dutch immigration service in the early 2000s. In its governing plan published on May 16, the coalition said it would aim for the \"strictest-ever asylum regime\" with stronger border controls and harsher rules for asylum seekers who arrive in the Netherlands, setting up a potential clash with the EU before even taking office.\n\nSchoof would head a cabinet that the four parties have said would have looser ties to parliament. It could take weeks to put together, with the parties all negotiating over the portfolios and responsibilities. Once he has formed a government, set to be the most right-wing in the Netherlands in decades, he will be sworn in by the king and officially become prime minister.\n\n\"Congratulations Dick. Dick Schoof has a great track record, is not a member of any party and thus stands above the parties, is honest and, on top of it, very friendly,\" Wilders reacted on social media X. That government will, however, have to stick to the agreement reached by the four parties, which is aiming to secure exceptions on EU asylum and environmental rules.\n\nFar right leader Wilders last week said he expected the new government to be operational by end-June. Besides his experience at the intelligence and anti-terrorism services, Schoof has also worked on reforming the Dutch police force.\n\nHaving worked mostly on Dutch domestic policies, Schoof, a divorced father of two, does not have a high international profile.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Schoof", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dick Schoof"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_Netherlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the Netherlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geert_Wilders", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Geert Wilders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_for_Freedom", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party for Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Coordinator_for_Security_and_Counterterrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Coordinator for Security and Counterterrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Intelligence_and_Security_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Intelligence and Security Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Border control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/29_02_2020_16_58_29_8149663.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604460", "eventUri": "eng-9604460", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "textStart": 1126, "textEnd": 1132}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

They are sceptical about allowing more countries to join the bloc.\n\nWhile they agreed on the programme, the four parties failed to endorse Wilders' original pick for premier, who stepped down because he was being investigated for possible fraud. Ronald Plasterk, a former minister from the Dutch Labour party, said the probe was a distraction.\n\nThe newspaper NRC reported that he was accused of claiming sole credit for a patent for a new cancer therapy, earning him millions of euros.

announced on Tuesday.\n\nSchoof, 67, is the top civil servant at the Justice Ministry and has no current party affiliation.\n\nHe is regarded as an expert on security and migration -- two burning issues for the four coalition partners.\n\nSchoof was head of the intelligence and security service AIVD, coordinator in the fight against terrorism, and also director of Immigration Services.\n\nThe Netherlands has been in political limbo since November's general election, which sent shockwaves across Europe.\n\nGeert Wilders' nationalist and right-wing Party for Freedom (PVV) scored a dramatic victory, but not enough to govern outright.\n\nIt took months for the \"anti-Islam, anti-immigration and anti-EU\" firebrand to persuade other parties to join him in a coalition.\n\nWilders has promised \"the strictest asylum policy ever\" and drastic curbs on immigration.\n\nHis programme also includes relaxing environmental regulations for farmers and cancelling subsidies for sustainable energy.\n\nIn a concession to make the coalition possible, Wilders said he would not seek to be Prime Minister and renounced some of his most controversial demands, such as the ban on mosques.\n\nWilders finally announced two weeks ago that his PVV had agreed a four-way coalition with the liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) of outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte, the conservative New Social Contract (NSC) party and the populist Farmer-Citizen Movement (BBB).\n\nWilders said Schoof, who was once a member of the centre-left Labour Party, \"stands above the parties and has our trust\".\n\nIt is expected to take several weeks before a Cabinet line-up will be finalised and King Willem-Alexander swears them into office.\n\nRutte, who has been Prime Minister

"body": "Dick Schoof, the former head of Dutch intelligence and anti-terrorism, is set to become the new Prime Minister of the Netherlands at the head of a coaliton government led by Geert Wilders' far-right PVV party.\n\nA former head of the Dutch intelligence and security service AIVD is set to become Prime Minister of the Netherlands at the head of a right-wing-led coalition government.\n\nDick Schoof, a 67-year-old senior civil servant at the country's justice ministry with no current party affiliation, is considered an expert on security and migration - two key issues for the four coalition partners.\n\nThe largest party in the coalition is the nationalist Party for Freedom (PVV), which emerged as the largest party after November's election -- albeit with less than a quarter of the vote and nowhere near enough support to govern by itself.\n\nAfter months of negotiations, the PVV was able to strike a deal with the liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) of outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte, the conservative New Social Contract (NSC) party and the populist Farmer-Citizen Movement (BBB).\n\nAs part of the negotiations, PVV leader Geert Wilders agreed to forfeit the office of Prime Minister and make concessions on some of his more extreme anti-Islam policies such as a ban on mosques.\n\nWilders, known for his inflammatory far-wing rhetoric and anti-immigration and anti-EU positions, said Schoof, who was once a member of the center-left Labour Party, \"stands above the parties and has our trust.\"\n\nAs well as the AIVD intelligence agency, Schoof also headed up the NCTV anti-terrorism agency for several years and was head of the Dutch immigration service in the early 2000s.\n\nThough a high-ranking senior official for a long

He said he had been appointed to put a new cabinet strategy into practice and that is what he intended to do, while serving the public good.\n\nThe coalition agreement, he said, is an ambitious one with proposals for a large number of issues - getting a grip on immigration and asylum, financial security for families and farmers, and international security. \"This is why I am standing here,\" he said.\n\nIn the coming days, work will start on putting together a new team of ministers, he said, and that would involve \"the people with and for whom were are doing it\", such as social organisations, public services and industry.\n\n\"As political management, we will keep working on the social issues and take the concerns of all the Dutch into account, so we can work on building trust in government.\"\n\nSchoof, 67, is currently the most senior civil servant in the justice ministry. He has previously headed the counter-terrorism unit NCTV and the immigration service IND as well as the domestic security service AIVD. He was also head of the crisis team in the wake of the downing of MH17.\n\nHe has been put forward to lead an \"extra-parliamentary cabinet\" made up of political appointees and outside experts, who will all first face a grilling in parliament before they are confirmed in the job.\n\nPVV leader Geert Wilders said he is \"happy and proud\" to have Schoof as prime ministerial candidate. \"He has good experience on the right issues... he is an independent person who is not a member of any political party.\" All for new coalition parties are behind his appointment, Wilders said.\n\nWilders is leader of the biggest party in parliament but failed to get the backing of the other potential cabinet partners to be prime minister himself.\n\n\"He has broad civil service experience in areas that are very important,\" said NSC leader Pieter Omtzigt. \"He has no political experience but will pick that up very soon.\"\n\nSchoof was formerly a member of the Labour party (PvdA), but left the party in 2021, saying he no longer felt at home there. He is described by people who have worked with him as \"expert\", \"straight forward\" and \"thorough\". \"He is possibly the most important civil servant, particularly in times of crisis,\" RTL correspondent Fons Lambie said.\n\nSchoof said in an interview with the Groene Amsterdammer earlier this year that he had difficulty with the frame which said \"democracy is about to die, as a result of the election result\".\n\nThe rule of law and democracy are always subject to change, he said, adding that when it comes to anti-terrorism legislation, \"we look at privacy and freedom differently today than we did 20 years ago\".\n\nThe PVV victory in the November general election, he said in the interview, \"is a sign that many people no longer have faith that the government can solve things, and perhaps not in each other either.\"", "source": {"uri": "dutchnews.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "DutchNews.nl"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robin_pascoe@dutchnews.nl", "name": "Robin Pascoe",

Talks began after last November's general election, in which the Freedom Party was the clear winner.\n\nHowever, in response to resistance at the prospect of Mr Wilders as the country's first far-right premier, all four leaders ruled themselves out of contention for prime minister and instead agreed instead to remain at the head of their parties in parliament.\n\nThe coalition's first choice for prime minister was retired genetics professor, Ronald Plasterk, who withdrew last week.\n\nAlthough never officially nominated, Mr Plasterk's departure soured the search and led to a string of high-profile personalities publicly ruling themselves out - until Mr Wilders was forced to reassure MPs last week that filling the top job had become \"an acute priority\".\n\nMr Schoof, who is secretary general of the department of justice and who had connections to the Labour Party in the past, has never been mentioned in media speculation about Mr Rutte's successor.\n\nHe will face the daunting job of implementing the coalition's programme for government, which includes tough new restrictions on migration and seeking an opt-out from EU environmental policies on CO2 emissions.\n\nSignificantly, he previously worked in the Immigration and Naturalisation Service, specifically on reform of legislation, which may give him some valuable insights.\n\nMore immediately, he joins the search for other highly qualified political outsiders who may wish to join the coalition as \"technocratic\" expert ministers - a change designed to \"loosen\" the relationship between the new cabinet and parliament.\n\nHis nomination is a belated coup for Mr Wilders, who told reporters after meeting Mr Schoof on Tuesday evening: \"I am happy and proud.

top justice ministry official and former intelligence chief is to be the new Dutch prime minister, the public broadcaster NOS has reported, five months after Geert Wilders' far-right Freedom party (PVV) finished first in parliamentary elections.\n\nDick Schoof, the highest official at the justice and security ministry, will be formally nominated as the preferred candidate by the four parties making up the Netherlands' right-wing coalition government on Tuesday, NOS said.\n\nSchoof, 67, formerly a national counterterrorism coordinator and director of the AIVD intelligence and IND immigration services, will head a\"business\" or \"extra-parliamentary\" cabinet of equal numbers of political appointees and experts.\n\nPVV, whose manifesto included calls for bans on mosques, the Qur'an and Islamic headscarves in government buildings as well as a \"Nexit\" referendum on leaving the EU, won a shock 26% of the vote in elections last November.\n\nBut its 37 seats left it far short of a majority in the 150-seat assembly and needing to negotiate an alliance with the liberal-conservative VVD, the BBB agrarian protest party, and New Social Contract (NSC), a centre-right political startup.\n\nWilders abandoned hope of becoming prime minister in March in the face of his coalition partners' reluctance to nominate him for the job, while another hopeful, former Labour party minister Ronald Plasterk, dropped out last week.\n\nWilders and the other party leaders, including Dilan Ye\u015filg\u00f6z-Zegerius, who succeeded outgoing prime minister Mark Rutte as VVD leader, Caroline van der Plas of the BBB and NSC's Pieter Omtzigt, will sit in the Dutch parliament.\n\nThe four parties this month reached a coalition agreement including plans for a radical tightening of policy on asylum seekers and immigration, an increase in natural gas production and the relaxation of multiple green regulations.\n\nBorder controls will be intensified, admittance procedures shortened, and people denied asylum in another EU country will be sent away immediately, with labour migration and the flow of foreign students to Dutch universities also curbed.\n\nOn the environment, daytime motorway speeds - reduced to 62mph in an effort to cut nitrogen pollution - are due to be returned to 80mph \"where possible\", and subsidised \"red diesel\" will be reintroduced for farmers from 2027.\n\nIf approved by parliament, Schoof is expected to lead the continuing search for new ministers and state secretaries with the objective of being able to announce a full cabinet before the summer recess at the beginning of July.\n\nThe Telegraaf newspaper reported that Schoof was a once a member of the PvdA Labour party, but had left it an indeterminate time ago.",

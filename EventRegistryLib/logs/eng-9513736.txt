He then moved to Arizona State the following year as a graduate assistant.\n\nThe 38-year-old has since worked at Sam Houston State, Alabama, Memphis, Georgia and now Oregon. He's worked under Nick Saban and Kirby Smart, but when he was a graduate assistant under Todd Graham at Pitt and Arizona State, he had a legendary \"a** chewing\" moment, which he recalled.\n\n\"I've had a lot of them, Kirby Smart is a Grade-A professional in giving those, Todd Graham is the best ... Early as a coach, Todd Graham probably prepared me for a lot of future a**-chewing. Early as a coach, I was running the scout team as a GA, this time, you only had one GA on offense and one GA on defense,\" Lanning said to Bussin with the Boys.\n\n\"I was coaching all 11 on offense, after practice one day, Coach Graham goes, 'Man, I'm sorry, I apologize, we have the worst scout team in the nation and it's not your fault, it's my fault because I hired the guy, he is running the scout team, and points at me. He runs the scout team and he is the worst.' I had just been coaching high school ball the year before. Let's say the scout team got better, but it was a good humbling moment for me... I couldn't have been smaller in that moment.\" Lanning continued.\n\nIt was a funny story from Lanning, who used that as motivation to get better, which has helped land him the head coaching job at Oregon.\n\nDan Lanning's immediate success at Oregon\n\nDan Lanning was hired by the Oregon Ducks in December 2021 as he signed a six-year, $29.1 million contract with the Ducks.\n\nLanning had immediate success at Oregon, as in his first year with the program, the Ducks went 10-3. In his second year with the program, Oregon went 12-2 and played in the Pac-12 championship game but lost to Washington, which also dashed their playoff hopes.\n\nAfter two successful seasons at Oregon, Lanning was rumored to be a candidate for the job opening at Alabama.

I'm exactly where I want to be. I've said it a lot, but right now I've got an 11-year-old a 12-year-old, and a 14-year-old. I'm committed to those guys finishing school here. For me to do that, we've got to win. So, I'm not interested in another opportunity.\"\n\nDan Lanning didn't share who the recruit was that he was talking to. However, he did explain that there was a recruit whose mother was very concerned about those rumors, and led to the video to try and calm her nerves.\n\n\"One of the reasons we released the video was I'm talking to a recruit's mom the night before, and she's saying, 'I'm seeing all over the internet you're leaving.' No, I'm not...I need this d-tackle. We're talking on the phone, I was talking, 'What would make you comfortable? I'm telling you I'm not going anywhere. what would make you feel comfortable?' [She asked] 'Are you gonna make an announcement?' I said, 'How about I make a video?'\"\n\nIn the video that Dan Lanning ended up posting on social media, Lanning explained that he's staying and happy at Oregon.\n\n\"So, we make a video and I sent it to her first before we ever released it. Because she had just gone through the same experience with another coach telling her he wasn't gonna leave. Apparently, a lot of coaches say one thing and then do another. So, I just wanted to make sure that we got this kid.\"\n\nDan Lanning got to Oregon in 2022. Since then, in two seasons with the Ducks, he's led the team to a 22-5 record and a Fiesta Bowl win. Now, as the team transitions into the Big Ten, he wants to figure out what the Ducks are truly capable of.\n\n\"We're building something here. I see a lot of people leave before they ever get to see what they could accomplish and what's finished,\" Lanning said.\n\nIn the video that Dan Lanning released to announce he was staying at Oregon, it shows him speaking in a team meeting. He also did the voiceover for the video.\n\n\"I want to be here in Eugene for as long as Eugene will have me,\" Lanning said in the voiceover. \"This place has everything that I could possibly ever want.\"\n\n\"This is a little bit of a problem in society today with people looking for what's next and whether it's an opportunity, and the reality is the grass is not always greener. In fact the grass is damned green in Eugene.\"\n\nThe video also included text in the video, which seemed to act as a recruiting pitch for Dan Lanning and Oregon.\n\n\"If you're scared your coach is leaving...

The game serves as the final public football event for the Ducks as members of the Pac-12 with an official move to the Big Ten on the horizon in July. So, while there's plenty of conversation and speculation about the depth chart, development of young stars and how the portal additions have acclimated to the team, there's a march larger point of intrigue considering where Oregon sits in the national picture heading into this season.\n\nIs this is a team that can do what hasn't been done in the modern era and win a power conference during its first year in the league?\n\nRecent history would say no.\n\nSince 2010, which we're marking as the starting point for this modern era of conference realignment, the high-water mark for Year 1 in a new power conference is Texas A&M going 6-2 in SEC (2012). Powered by Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel, the Aggies were a force that took the league by surprise immediately and sparked conference-wide adjustments. Despite a head-to-head win over Alabama that season, Texas A&M finished second to the Crimson Tide in the SEC West.\n\nNebraska went 5-3 in conference play during its first season in the Big Ten (2011), making a statement with wins over Ohio State, Penn State and Michigan State, but the Cornhuskers ultimately finished two games out of first place in the Legends Division.\n\nLouisville compiled a 5-3 conference record in its first year of ACC play (2014), but finished third in the division behind Florida State and Clemson.\n\nOf the 16 examples highlighting a program making its power-conference debut since 2010, none have played for a conference championship and only those three (2012 Texas A&M, 2011 Nebraska and 2014 Louisville) even finished with a winning record in league play.\n\nBut what we have with Oregon already feels different because the Ducks aren't moving up in competition as much as they are pushing other Big Ten teams down with their impending arrival. This isn't a program that's agreed to \"take the checks and take the losses\" with a move up in competition as Oregon views itself in a way that many Big Ten schools don't at this point in time: a program that competes for national championships.\n\nSince the hire of Dan Lanning, Oregon has adopted his top-to-bottom vision of how a national-championship program is built and run in the modern era. The Ducks are recruiting at a high level out of high school while also adding game-changing talent from the transfer portal. They've adapted to the needs and personality of the modern player without sacrificing some of the old-school tenets that prove to be foundational building blocks of championship programs in college football. Lanning demands consistency from his players and staff as well as a relentless pursuit of excellence that has already delivered results on the field.\n\nBut it has yet to deliver a championship, or even a College Football Playoff appearance.\n\nThere's a hunger around Oregon to take that next step, which is both the smallest (in terms of margins) and toughest (in terms of challenge) step to take in the ascent of a college football program. And one of the biggest storylines for the Big Ten in 2024 is whether Oregon, in its debut as a conference member, will take that step, and in doing so, make modern conference realignment history by playing for a conference title in Year 1.\n\nWinning at the margins\n\nOregon is 22-5 since Lanning took over, and in two short years, he's already delivered one of the winningest seasons in program history (12 wins in 2023; tied for second behind the 13-2, CFP runner-up finish in 2014) as well as one of the highest-rated recruiting classes in program history (3rd nationally in 2024, according to 247Sports Composite). In February, after finishing off that top-three class, Lanning told Oregon's radio crew this team \"is the most talented roster I've had since we've been here.\" The on-field success of the last two seasons and the on-paper talent advantage Oregon will have against many of its opponents have set the stage for those championship expectations. Championships are not decided on paper, though.\n\nWhile winning 22 of 27 games across two seasons certainly signifies success, Oregon's shortcomings at the margins have prevented the Ducks from accomplishing all of their goals. Since a 49-3 loss to Georgia in Lanning's debut on Sept. 3, 2022, Oregon has not been defeated by more than four points. The combination of a three-point loss to Washington and a four-point loss to Oregon State in November 2022 kept the Ducks out of the Pac-12 Championship Game, and last season featured not just one but two three-point losses to the rival Huskies.\n\nThe first defeat, on the road in Seattle, included failed fourth-down attempts, yielding a 53-yard touchdown drive on two plays and a missed game-tying kick. The second came in the Pac-12 title game where Oregon did not give the game up as much it had to climb out of a two-score, first-quarter hole to get back into the game late. In all four losses, there are a handful of painful moments for Oregon fans to revisit; if just a few different results go their way, the Ducks are right in the middle of the national championship picture. The math doesn't add up exactly, but this is essentially a 22-5 program over the last two years that's just a few plays away from 26-1.\n\nWhen a roster is as talented as Oregon's, achieving your goals is going to come down to execution and winning at the margins.\n\n\"We're not going to be a team that beats ourselves,\" Lanning said after the team's second scrimmage last weekend. \"That's something we have to improve on from last season.\"\n\nThat's where the top-to-bottom vision of a championship program comes into play, where Lanning's experience of seeing how players need to carry themselves to compete at the highest level pays off for the Ducks. Those seemingly small, self-inflicted errors in the biggest games have added up in a way that has left Oregon wanting more and knowing it can achieve more. That's a big focus of how the Ducks are preparing not just for life in the Big Ten, but how a season is going to play out when you start firmly in the position of a national championship contender.\n\nPassing game and pass defense in the spotlight\n\nDon't expect a lot of unique football from a scheme perspective in the Oregon spring game, but there are a couple of spots where we could gain further insight. Some of the most intrigue, on both sides of the ball, will come from Oregon's passing attack in the post-Bo Nix era as well as the pass defense -- with all aspects of that competition featuring notable transfer portal additions.\n\nOregon was able to land two experienced quarterbacks from the portal, headlined by Dillon Gabriel arriving after an extremely productive year at Oklahoma where he added plenty of yards to his career totals that stretch all the way back to his debut at UCF. With Gabriel expected to serve as the QB1 from the jump, the spring game and the rest of the offseason will also include plenty of excitement around the development of former five-star prospect Dante Moore. Originally committed to Oregon out of high school, Moore flipped to UCLA before signing day and then even earned a couple starts for the Bruins as a true freshman last season. Things did not go well for the rookie, and now he gets a fresh start with what seems to be a nice runway for development. The raw tools are worthy of his five-star projection coming out of high school, and whether it's in 2024 or beyond, the hope is he'll be ready to deliver when his number is called.\n\nIn terms of pass catchers, the Ducks took a huge step forward last year with offensive coordinator Will Stein. Oregon had not produced a 1,000-yard receiver since 2018, but two emerged last season: Troy Franklin (1,383) and Tez Johnson (1,182). Johnson is back, as is third-leading receiver Traeshon Holden and fourth-leading receiver Gary Bryant Jr., both of whom joined the Ducks out of the transfer portal prior to last season. Oregon added even more firepower to that group in the transfer portal during this offseason with the signing of former five-star prospect Evan Stewart out of Texas A&M. Watching how Gabriel and Moore both work in Stein's offense with this group of extremely potent pass catchers will be of great interest as we determine the ceiling for an Oregon offense that was one of the best in the country last season.\n\nJust as intriguing to watch will be how Oregon's retooled pass defense looks against this group of explosive wide receivers. The Ducks ranked first in the Pac-12 and 13th nationally in pass efficiency defense last year, but that group is losing some of the best secondary players like Khyree Jackson and Evan Williams. Lanning and the defensive staff have gone to the portal to maintain that level of excellence, bringing in all-conference defensive back Jabbar Muhammed from Washington, all-conference defensive back Kam Alexander from UTSA and Kobe Savage from Kansas State. All three players are expected to compete for starter's snaps this fall, so seeing them tested against one of the best wide receiver rooms in the country will make for an entertaining show on Saturday.\n\nOregon's Big Ten title pursuit not in a vacuum\n\nWhile it is easy to focus on Oregon's crazy roster talent and just how close they have been to competing for championships in each of the last two years, its pursuit of a historic Big Ten title is not happening in a vacuum. Oregon may have one of the most talented rosters in program history, but there's a strong argument that the most talented roster in the Big Ten belongs to Ohio State. And while Oregon has been knocking on the door of the College Football Playoff each of the last two years, the Ducks are going to competing in a Big Ten with three programs -- Michigan (twice), Ohio State, Washington -- who have combined for four CFP appearances in the last two years. If Oregon is going to win the Big Ten and become the first team in this modern realignment era to win a conference in Year 1, it will have to topple programs that have accomplished more in the last two seasons.\n\nThat's why the last step in the path to championship contention is the hardest, even though it comes with the smallest margins. A program like Oregon can do everything in its power to load up the roster with championship talent and try to instill the habits and routines that produce winning at the highest level. But, to finish on the top of the mountain, you have to knock someone else off, and the re-tooled Big Ten that Oregon is joining has a top tier that is more competitive than any other in the country. Even with a loaded field, though, it's hard not to like the Ducks' chances of making history with a Big Ten title in Year 1.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS

Former Oregon football quarterback Bo Nix, center Jackson Powers-Johnson and wide receiver Troy Franklin are three Ducks projected to be drafted early, possibly in the first round.\n\nOregon coach Dan Lanning oozes excitement for his former stars. In the middle of football spring practices, with the Oregon football spring game on Saturday, April 27th, Lanning hopes to support the draft hopefuls as best he can.\n\n\"You obviously can't be in three places at one time probably starts with who asked you,\" Lanning said after practice on Tuesday. \"... We still have practice on Thursday and have a walkthrough on Friday. So we'll be creative and see what we can accomplish.\"\n\nThe NFL Draft spotlight has shined on Nix and Power-Johnson. Nix has pro comparisons to New Orleans Saints' Drew Brees and Dallas Cowboys' Tony Romo. Nix is the only prospect who has met with all 32 NFL teams ahead of the NFL Draft, according to WalterFootball's prospect tracker. Talk about racking up the airline miles!\n\nPowers-Johnson has been linked to the Dallas Cowboys, who have the No. 24-overall selection, and have a major need at center.\n\n\"It'd be amazing to be drafted by the (Dallas) Cowboys,\" said Powers-Johnson in an exclusive interview. \"The rich history of the team, the colors, the uniforms ... Everything about it is special. It would mean a lot to me to have an opportunity to play there.\"\n\nMore Ducks hoping to becoming ProDucks include: defensive end Brandon Dorlus, cornerback Khyree Jackson, running back Bucky Irving, safety Evan Williams, outside linebacker Mase Funa, cornerback Jamal Hill and safety Steve Stephens IV.\n\n\"We love seeing guys reach their goals and aspirations,\" Lanning said of Oregon's prospects in the 2024 NFL Draft. \"... I think you'll continue to see more and more players drafted here at Oregon. As we continue to develop the roster and develop our players. Credit to them. They earned that opportunity to have that day that they can celebrate and we're really excited for those guys.\"\n\nThe 2024 NFL Draft is in Detroit, Michigan. The first round will begin at 5 p.m. PT on Thursday, April 25.

Saturday, April 27 will be the first public look at quarterback Dillon Gabriel in a Duck uniform, one of the most sought after players from the transfer portal.\n\nEntering 2024, Gabriel is considered a Heisman Trophy contender with the third-best odds to win the prestigious honor. No one has a bigger shot to make an impact on the 2024 Oregon Ducks football team than Gabriel, who has already been compared to former Oregon quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Marcus Mariota. Both quarterbacks were raised on the island of Oahu in towns less than an hour from one another. Both are duel-three quarterback that wear No. 8.\n\nSaturday marks Oregon coach Dan Lanning's third Duck spring game. Lanning invited Eugene native and fan-favorite artist Mat Kearney to perform a postgame concert on the field of Autzen Stadium. Fans will be invited down onto the field to enjoy the concert.\n\nAdmission for the spring game is free and gates open at noon. Fans are encouraged to bring non-perishable food items to donate to Food For Lane County. Students are encouraged to sit in sections 7 and 8 and will be provided rally towels.\n\nUpdated Duck jersey numbers for 2024 can be found here.\n\nFUN FACT: In appreciation of the military, the spring game is highlighted by a halftime tribute to Gold Star Families, in-game veteran recognitions, an F-15 flyover and a postgame gift exchange between the Oregon football team and active duty military.\n\n\"It's hard to recreate a game-like atmosphere,\" Lanning told reporters. \"But you're at Autzen.

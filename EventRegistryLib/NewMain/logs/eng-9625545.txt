The trip includes a state visit with President Macron, discussions with Ukraine's President Zelenskiy, and meetings with WWII veterans.\n\nPresident Joe Biden flew to France on Tuesday to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day on a trip designed to underscore his commitment to U.S. allies in Europe and contrast his vision of democracy with his 2024 political opponent Donald Trump. Biden will spend five days in France and attend D-Day celebrations in Normandy, where U.S. and allied forces stormed French beaches in an attack that helped defeat Nazi Germany in World War II, as well as deliver a high-profile speech and hold a formal state visit with President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nWhile in Normandy Biden will sit down for talks with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy about the war effort to repel Russian invaders, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters aboard the presidential flight to Paris. Biden's remarks in Normandy, both on Thursday at the formal 80th anniversary ceremony and on Friday at the famed Pointe du Hoc cliffs, will center around the dangers of isolationism and the need to stand up to dictators, Sullivan said.\n\nBiden will draw a connection from World War Two through the Cold War and creation of the NATO alliance to today, \"where we face once again war in Europe, where NATO has rallied to defend freedom and sovereignty.\" In what promises to be an emotional moment, Biden will meet the aged veterans who participated in the D-Day invasion.\n\nWhite House national security spokesperson John Kirby said the potential use of some $300 billion in frozen Russian assets to aid Ukraine would be discussed by Biden and Macron during the visit. Biden, a Democrat, is running for re-election in November against Trump, a Republican, and has made preserving and strengthening U.S. democracy a key part of his campaign in the aftermath of Trump's chaotic four years in office.\n\nTrump refused to accept the results of the 2020 election, which sparked a deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters on January 6, 2021; he has vowed to go after political opponents, deport immigrants and punish whistleblowers in a second term. Trump has threatened to abandon NATO allies if they do not bolster their defense spending and some fear he would pull the United States out of the alliance altogether if he were elected president again.\n\nBiden's message on democracy could be complicated by his staunch backing of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu in Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, after Hamas attacked Israel in October last year, killing over one thousand. The International Criminal Court has charged Netanyahu with war crimes and some international allies and left-leaning voters in the United States want Biden to stop the flow of U.S. military aid to Israel. The issue could hurt Biden in key states, including Michigan, in the November election.\n\nThe D-Day commemorations are set against a backdrop of a modern conflict in Europe, Russia's more than 2-year war with Ukraine. At a political fundraiser before his trip, Biden called the D-Day invasion \"one of the most important moments in the history of defense of freedom and democracy in the history of the world\" and said the sacrifices from that day must not be given up.\n\n\"Democracy is literally on the ballot this year. The future of democracy and freedom is at stake. We have brave soldiers who gave their lives on the beaches of Normandy who did their part,\" he told donors in Connecticut on Monday.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is

The issue could hurt Biden in key states, including Michigan, in the November election.\n\nThe D-Day commemorations are set against a backdrop of a modern conflict in Europe, Russia's more than 2-year war with Ukraine.\n\nAt a political fundraiser before his trip, Biden called the D-Day invasion \"one of the most important moments in the history of defense of freedom and democracy in the history of the world\" and said the sacrifices from that day must not be given up.\n\n\"Democracy is literally on the ballot this year.

The issue could hurt Biden in key states, including Michigan, in the November election.\n\nThe D-Day commemorations are set against a backdrop of a modern conflict in Europe, Russia's more than two-year war with Ukraine.\n\nAt a political fundraiser before his trip, Biden called the D-Day invasion \"one of the most important moments in the history of defence of freedom and democracy in the history of the world\" and said the sacrifices from that day must not be given up.\n\n\"Democracy is literally on the ballot this year. The future of democracy and freedom is at stake. We have brave soldiers who gave their lives on the beaches of Normandy who did their part,\" he told donors in Connecticut this week.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign

He'll also speak on Friday at Pointe du Hoc, a spot on the French coast where Army Rangers scaled seaside cliffs to overcome Nazi defenses.\n\nWhite House National Security adviser Jake Sullivan said aboard Air Force One on the way to France that Biden will stress how the men on those cliffs \"put the country ahead of themselves\" and detail \"the dangers of isolationism, and how, if we bow to dictators and fail to stand up to them, they keep going and ultimately America and the world pays a greater price.\"\n\nBiden will point out that, \"Eighty years later, we see dictators once again attempting to challenge the order, attempting to march in Europe,\" Sullivan said, \"and that freedom-loving nations need to rally to stand against that, as we have.\"\n\nHe also said Biden would be meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in France to discuss \"how we can continue and deepen our support for Ukraine.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Biden, along with his wife, Jill, will be honored by French President Emmanuel Macron with a state visit, including a military parade in Paris and a banquet at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, as well as business sessions where the leaders are to discuss strengthening their alliance, trade and security cooperation for the coming Olympic games.\n\nThe two leaders also are expected to discuss the Middle East. Biden has invested geopolitical capital in brokering a ceasefire to the Israel-Hamas war that would see the release of hostages, even as he has maintained his staunch support for Israel and resisted European efforts to recognize a Palestinian state or investigate Israel over its handling of the war.\n\nBiden, a Democrat, is scheduled to return to the United States on Sunday, but before he leaves France, he's expected to stop at a cemetery where American soldiers who died in World War I are buried. Trump, a Republican, skipped plans to visit the same site during a 2018 trip to France, a decision that the White House blamed on weather at the time.\n\nHowever, subsequent reporting found that Trump told aides he didn't want to go because he viewed the dead soldiers as \"suckers\" and \"losers.\" He has denied the comments, which Biden referenced during a fundraiser in Greenwich, Conn., on Monday.\n\n\"This guy does not deserve to be president,\" Biden said.\n\nAlthough foreign trips are ostensibly nonpartisan, Biden left no doubt that he sees a political connection between the D-Day anniversary and the election. The president described the invasion as \"one of the most important moments in the history of defense of freedom and democracy.\"\n\n\"I want to say as clearly as I can,\" he added. \"Democracy is literally on the ballot this year.\"\n\nBiden's trip to France will be followed by another to Italy later this month for the annual Group of Seven summit, a rare doubleheader of international diplomacy in the middle of the presidential election season. Biden will skip a subsequent gathering in Switzerland, where leaders will be focused on the war in Ukraine, to attend a campaign fundraiser in Los Angeles with Hollywood stars. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the United States instead.\n\nBiden's travels, plus the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Washington next month, aim to embody a vision of global American leadership that's central to his political identity but faces renewed threat from Trump.\n\nAlthough the two presidents are from the same generation -- Biden, 81, was born a year-and-a-half before D-Day; Trump, 77, was born two years after the invasion -- they developed divergent views on Europe and American alliances over the years.\n\nFor Biden, U.S. ties to Europe are a cornerstone of stability and a source of strength. For Trump, they're a drain on precious resources, and he's expressed more affinity for autocratic leaders such as Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose invasion of Ukraine has upended the continent.\n\nEven before voters decide which vision they prefer, cracks in Biden's foreign policy foundation have emerged. It took months to secure additional military assistance for Ukraine due to GOP resistance, and the delay led to depleted ammunition reserves and Russian advances on the battlefield.\n\n\"All that happened with a die-hard Atlanticist and die-hard alliance supporter in the White House,\" said Charles Kupchan, a Georgetown University professor who previously served as Europe director on President Barack Obama's National Security Council. \"Europeans have no option but to ask how reliable the United States can be.\"\n\nKupchan noted that \"the bipartisan compact behind a steady and robust American internationalism has collapsed.\"\n\nGiven the political complications at home, Kupchan said, Biden should be careful about drawing historical parallels between D-Day and Ukraine while he's in France.\n\n\"I'm not sure that he wants to say that this is a moment like 1940 or 1941,\" he said, especially since Biden has ruled out sending American troops to fight against the Russian invasion.\n\nLike all of his international engagements, Biden's trip will be shadowed by Trump's potential return to the White House. The presumptive Republican candidate, who last week became the first U.S. president to be convicted of a crime, has pledged to unravel American commitments to allies in Europe.\n\n\"It's every conversation. Every conversation is, what will happen?\" said Max Bergmann, who leads Europe research at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nBergmann, who was in the middle of a trip around the continent in the days before Biden arrived, said some European officials hope that a second Trump term would be no more damaging than his first, when he failed to follow through on some of his more extreme ideas. But he doubts Trump will be held in check without moderate members of his administration -- such as former Defense Secretary James Mattis -- who are unlikely to return.\n\n\"I'm not reassuring to them,\" Bergmann said.\n\nRachel Rizzo, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said there's a \"palpable sense of uncertainty\" as the United States and Europe wrestle with populist movements that have proven durably popular.\n\n\"This is not an aberration, this is not an accident,\" she said. \"There are real grievances that citizens of both continents have, and they're playing out in support of right-wing parties.\"\n\nIn another complication for Biden, his trip is taking place at the same time that his son, Hunter, is standing trial in Delaware. The younger Biden is accused of lying while purchasing a gun by claiming that he was not a drug addict. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe prosecution began presenting its case Tuesday, just days after Trump became the first U.S. president to be convicted of a felony. Trump was found guilty in New York of making illegal hush-money payments to an adult film actress who said they had sex. Trump denies the affair.\n\nPaul Begala, a longtime Democratic strategist, said Biden is probably better off ignoring Trump while he's in France.\n\n\"When you're 81 years old, and three-fourths of the country thinks you're too old, one of the things you have to do is to show strength,\" he said. \"That's what he's got to do over there. He's got to show strength.\"\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Sylvie Corbett and Fatima Hussein of The Associated Press.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is welcomed by France's Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, left, after arriving at Orly airport, south of Paris, Wednesday, June 5, 2024.

The issue could hurt Biden in key states, including Michigan, in the November election.\n\nThe D-Day commemorations are set against a backdrop of a modern conflict in Europe, Russia's more than two-year war with Ukraine.\n\nAt a political fundraiser before his trip, Biden called the D-Day invasion \"one of the most important moments in the history of defence of freedom and democracy in the history of the world\" and said the sacrifices from that day must not be given up.\n\n\"Democracy is literally on the ballot this year.

It is also set against deepening cracks between the U.S. and many European allies over how to manage the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nBiden arrived in Paris on Wednesday morning. On Thursday, he'll visit hallowed ground near the beaches of Normandy, where rows of bone-white headstones mark the graves of U.S. soldiers who died to bring an end to World War II. He'll also speak on Friday at Pointe du Hoc, a spot on the French coast where Army Rangers scaled seaside cliffs to overcome Nazi defenses.\n\nWhite House National Security adviser Jake Sullivan said aboard Air Force One on the way to France that Biden will stress how the men on those cliffs \"put the country ahead of themselves\" and detail \"the dangers of isolationism, and how, if we back dictators and fail to stand up to them, they keep going and ultimately America and the world pays a greater price.\"\n\n\"Eighty years later, we see dictators once again attempting to challenge the order, attempting to march in Europe,\" Sullivan said, \"and that freedom-loving nations need to rally to stand against that, as we have.\"\n\nHe also said Biden would be meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in France to discuss \"how we can continue and deepen our support for Ukraine.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Biden, along with his wife Jill, will be honored by French President Emmanuel Macron with a state visit, including a military parade in Paris and a banquet at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, as well as business sessions where the leaders are to discuss strengthening their alliance, trade, and security cooperation for the upcoming Olympic games.\n\nThe two leaders also are expected to discuss the Middle East. Biden has invested geopolitical capital in brokering a ceasefire to the Israel-Hamas war that would see the release of hostages, even as he has maintained his staunch support for Israel and resisted European efforts to recognize a Palestinian state or investigate Israel over its handling of the war.\n\nBiden, a Democrat, is scheduled to return to the United States on Sunday, but before he leaves France he's expected to stop at a cemetery where American soldiers who died in World War I are buried. Trump, a Republican, skipped plans to visit the same site during a 2018 trip to France, a decision that the White House blamed on weather at the time.\n\nHowever, subsequent reporting found that Trump told aides he didn't want to go because he viewed the dead soldiers as \"suckers\" and \"losers.\" He has denied the comments, which Biden referenced during a fundraiser in Greenwich, Conn., on Monday.\n\n\"This guy does not deserve to be president,\" Biden said.\n\nAlthough foreign trips are ostensibly nonpartisan, Biden left no doubt that he sees a political connection between the D-Day anniversary and the election. The president described the invasion as \"one of the most important moments in the history of defense of freedom and democracy.\"\n\n\"I want to say as clearly as I can,\" he added. \"Democracy is literally on the ballot this year.\"\n\nBiden's trip to France will be followed by another to Italy later this month for the annual Group of Seven summit, a rare doubleheader of international diplomacy in the middle of the presidential election season. Biden will skip a subsequent gathering in Switzerland, where leaders will be focused on the war in Ukraine, to attend a campaign fundraiser in Los Angeles with Hollywood stars. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the United States instead.\n\nBiden's travels, plus the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Washington next month, aim to embody a vision of global American leadership that's central to his political identity but faces renewed threat from Trump.\n\nAlthough the two presidents are from the same generation -- Biden, 81, was born one and a half years before D-Day; Trump, 77, was born two years after the invasion -- they developed divergent views on Europe and American alliances over the years.\n\nFor Biden, U.S. ties to Europe are a cornerstone of stability and a source of strength. For Trump, they're a drain on precious resources, and he's expressed more affinity for autocratic leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose invasion of Ukraine has upended the continent.\n\nEven before voters decide which vision they prefer, cracks in Biden's foreign policy foundation have emerged. It took months to secure additional military assistance for Ukraine due to GOP resistance, and the delay led to depleted ammunition reserves and Russian advances on the battlefield.\n\n\"All that happened with a die-hard Atlanticist and die-hard alliance supporter in the White House,\" said Charles Kupchan, a Georgetown University professor who previously served as Europe director on President Barack Obama's National Security Council. \"Europeans have no option but to ask how reliable the United States can be.\"\n\nKupchan noted that \"the bipartisan compact behind a steady and robust American internationalism has collapsed.\"\n\nGiven the political complications at home, Kupchan said, Biden should be careful about drawing historical parallels between D-Day and Ukraine while he's in France.\n\n\"I'm not sure that he wants to say that this is a moment like 1940 or 1941,\" he said, especially since Biden has ruled out sending American troops to fight against the Russian invasion.\n\nLike all of his international engagements, Biden's trip will be shadowed by Trump's potential return to the White House. The presumptive Republican candidate, who last week became the first U.S. president to be convicted of a crime, has pledged to unravel American commitments to allies in Europe.\n\n\"It's every conversation. Every conversation is, what will happen?\" said Max Bergmann, who leads Europe research at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nBergmann, who was in the middle of a trip around the continent in the days before Biden arrived, said some European officials hope that a second Trump term would be no more damaging than his first, when he failed to follow through on some of his more extreme ideas. But he doubts Trump will be held in check without moderate members of his administration -- such as former Defense Secretary James Mattis -- who are unlikely to return.\n\n\"I'm not reassuring to them,\" Bergmann said.\n\nRachel Rizzo, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said there's a \"palpable sense of uncertainty\" as the United States and Europe wrestle with populist movements that have proven durably popular.\n\n\"This is not an aberration, this is not an accident,\" she said. \"There are real grievances that citizens of both continents have, and they're playing out in support of right-wing parties.\"\n\nIn another complication for Biden, his trip is taking place at the same time that his son, Hunter, is standing trial in Delaware. The younger Biden is accused of lying while purchasing a gun by claiming that he was not a drug addict. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe prosecution began presenting its case Tuesday, just days after Trump became the first U.S. president to be convicted of a felony. Trump was found guilty in New York of making illegal hush money payments to an adult film actress who said they had sex. Trump denies the affair.\n\nPaul Begala, a longtime Democratic strategist, said Biden is probably better off ignoring Trump while he's in France.\n\n\"When you're 81 years old, and three-fourths of the country thinks you're too old, one of the things you have to do is to show strength,\" he said. \"That's what he's got to do over there. He's got to show strength.\"", "source": {"uri": "naharnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Naharnet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type":

Trump, a Republican, skipped plans to visit the same site during a 2018 trip to France, a decision that the White House blamed on weather at the time.\n\nHowever, subsequent reporting found that Trump told aides he didn't want to go because he viewed the dead soldiers as \"suckers\" and \"losers.\" He has denied the comments, which Biden referenced during a fundraiser in Greenwich, Conn., on Monday.\n\n\"This guy does not deserve to be president,\" Biden said.\n\nAlthough foreign trips are ostensibly nonpartisan, Biden left no doubt that he sees a political connection between the D-Day anniversary and the election. The president described the invasion as \"one of the most important moments in the history of defense of freedom and democracy.\"\n\n\"I want to say as clearly as I can,\" he added. \"Democracy is literally on the ballot this year.\"\n\nBiden's trip to France will be followed by another to Italy later this month for the annual Group of Seven summit, a rare doubleheader of international diplomacy in the middle of the presidential election season. Biden will skip a subsequent gathering in Switzerland, where leaders will be focused on the war in Ukraine, to attend a campaign fundraiser in Los Angeles with Hollywood stars. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the United States instead.\n\nBiden's travels, plus the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Washington next month, aim to embody a vision of global American leadership that's central to his political identity but faces renewed threat from Trump.\n\nAlthough the two presidents are from the same generation -- Biden, 81, was born one and a half years before D-Day; Trump, 77, was born two years after the invasion -- they developed divergent views on Europe and American alliances over the years.\n\nFor Biden, U.S. ties to Europe are a cornerstone of stability and a source of strength. For Trump, they're a drain on precious resources, and he's expressed more affinity for autocratic leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose invasion of Ukraine has upended the continent.\n\nEven before voters decide which vision they prefer, cracks in Biden's foreign policy foundation have emerged. It took months to secure additional military assistance for Ukraine due to GOP resistance, and the delay led to depleted ammunition reserves and Russian advances on the battlefield.\n\n\"All that happened with a die-hard Atlanticist and die-hard alliance supporter in the White House,\" said Charles Kupchan, a Georgetown University professor who previously served as Europe director on President Barack Obama's National Security Council. \"Europeans have no option but to ask how reliable the United States can be.\"\n\nKupchan noted that \"the bipartisan compact behind a steady and robust American internationalism has collapsed.\"\n\nGiven the political complications at home, Kupchan said, Biden should be careful about drawing historical parallels between D-Day and Ukraine while he's in France.\n\n\"I'm not sure that he wants to say that this is a moment like 1940 or 1941,\" he said, especially since Biden has ruled out sending American troops to fight against the Russian invasion.\n\nLike all of his international engagements, Biden's trip will be shadowed by Trump's potential return to the White House. The presumptive Republican candidate, who last week became the first U.S. president to be convicted of a crime, has pledged to unravel American commitments to allies in Europe.\n\n\"It's every conversation. Every conversation is, what will happen?\" said Max Bergmann, who leads Europe research at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nBergmann, who was in the middle of a trip around the continent in the days before Biden arrived, said some European officials hope that a second Trump term would be no more damaging than his first, when he failed to follow through on some of his more extreme ideas. But he doubts Trump will be held in check without moderate members of his administration -- such as former Defense Secretary James Mattis -- who are unlikely to return.\n\n\"I'm not reassuring to them,\" Bergmann said.\n\nRachel Rizzo, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said there's a \"palpable sense of uncertainty\" as the United States and Europe wrestle with populist movements that have proven durably popular.\n\n\"This is not an aberration, this is not an accident,\" she said. \"There are real grievances that citizens of both continents have, and they're playing out in support of right-wing parties.\"\n\nIn another complication for Biden, his trip is taking place at the same time that his son, Hunter, is standing trial in Delaware. The younger Biden is accused of lying while purchasing a gun by claiming that he was not a drug addict. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe prosecution began presenting its case Tuesday, just days after Trump became the first U.S. president to be convicted of a felony. Trump was found guilty in New York of making illegal hush money payments to an adult film actress who said they had sex. Trump denies the affair.\n\nPaul Begala, a longtime Democratic strategist, said Biden is probably better off ignoring Trump while he's in France.\n\n\"When you're 81 years old, and three-fourths of the country thinks you're too old, one of the things you have to do is to show strength,\" he said. \"That's what he's got to do over there. He's got to show strength.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Sylvie Corbett in Paris and Fatima Hussein in Greenwich, Connecticut, contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "keyt.com",

It is also set against deepening cracks between the U.S. and many European allies over how to manage the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nBiden will arrive in Paris on Wednesday morning. On Thursday, he'll visit hallowed ground near the beaches of Normandy, where rows of bone-white headstones mark the graves of U.S. soldiers who died to bring an end to World War II.

It is also set against deepening cracks between the U.S. and many European allies over how to manage the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nBiden arrived in Paris on Wednesday morning, and he was welcomed by French officials and an honor guard. On Thursday, he'll visit hallowed ground near the beaches of Normandy, where rows of bone-white headstones mark the graves of U.S. soldiers who died to bring an end to World War II. He'll also speak on Friday at Pointe du Hoc, a spot on the French coast where Army Rangers scaled seaside cliffs to overcome Nazi defenses.\n\nWhite House National Security adviser Jake Sullivan said aboard Air Force One on the way to France that Biden will stress how the men on those cliffs \"put the country ahead of themselves\" and detail \"the dangers of isolationism, and how, if we bow to dictators and fail to stand up to them, they keep going and ultimately America and the world pays a greater price.\"\n\n\"Eighty years later, we see dictators once again attempting to challenge the order, attempting to march in Europe,\" Sullivan said, \"and that freedom-loving nations need to rally to stand against that, as we have.\"\n\nHe also said Biden would be meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in France to discuss \"how we can continue and deepen our support for Ukraine.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Biden, along with his wife Jill, will be honored by French President Emmanuel Macron with a state visit, including a military parade in Paris and a banquet at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, as well as business sessions where the leaders are to discuss strengthening their alliance, trade, and security cooperation for the upcoming Olympic games.\n\nThe two leaders also are expected to discuss the Middle East. Biden has invested geopolitical capital in brokering a ceasefire to the Israel-Hamas war that would see the release of hostages, even as he has maintained his staunch support for Israel and resisted European efforts to recognize a Palestinian state or investigate Israel over its handling of the war.\n\nBiden, a Democrat, is scheduled to return to the United States on Sunday, but before he leaves France he's expected to stop at a cemetery where American soldiers who died in World War I are buried. Trump, a Republican, skipped plans to visit the same site during a 2018 trip to France, a decision that the White House blamed on weather at the time.\n\nHowever, subsequent reporting found that Trump told aides he didn't want to go because he viewed the dead soldiers as \"suckers\" and \"losers.\" He has denied the comments, which Biden referenced during a fundraiser in Greenwich, Conn., on Monday.\n\n\"This guy does not deserve to be president,\" Biden said.\n\nAlthough foreign trips are ostensibly nonpartisan, Biden left no doubt that he sees a political connection between the D-Day anniversary and the election. The president described the invasion as \"one of the most important moments in the history of defense of freedom and democracy.\"\n\n\"I want to say as clearly as I can,\" he added. \"Democracy is literally on the ballot this year.\"\n\nBiden's trip to France will be followed by another to Italy later this month for the annual Group of Seven summit, a rare doubleheader of international diplomacy in the middle of the presidential election season. Biden will skip a subsequent gathering in Switzerland, where leaders will be focused on the war in Ukraine, to attend a campaign fundraiser in Los Angeles with Hollywood stars. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the United States instead.\n\nBiden's travels, plus the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Washington next month, aim to embody a vision of global American leadership that's central to his political identity but faces renewed threat from Trump.\n\nAlthough the two presidents are from the same generation -- Biden, 81, was born one and a half years before D-Day; Trump, 77, was born two years after the invasion -- they developed divergent views on Europe and American alliances over the years.\n\nFor Biden, U.S. ties to Europe are a cornerstone of stability and a source of strength. For Trump, they're a drain on precious resources, and he's expressed more affinity for autocratic leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose invasion of Ukraine has upended the continent.\n\nEven before voters decide which vision they prefer, cracks in Biden's foreign policy foundation have emerged. It took months to secure additional military assistance for Ukraine due to GOP resistance, and the delay led to depleted ammunition reserves and Russian advances on the battlefield.\n\n\"All that happened with a die-hard Atlanticist and die-hard alliance supporter in the White House,\" said Charles Kupchan, a Georgetown University professor who previously served as Europe director on President Barack Obama's National Security Council. \"Europeans have no option but to ask how reliable the United States can be.\"\n\nKupchan noted that \"the bipartisan compact behind a steady and robust American internationalism has collapsed.\"\n\nGiven the political complications at home, Kupchan said, Biden should be careful about drawing historical parallels between D-Day and Ukraine while he's in France.\n\n\"I'm not sure that he wants to say that this is a moment like 1940 or 1941,\" he said, especially since Biden has ruled out sending American troops to fight against the Russian invasion.\n\nLike all of his international engagements, Biden's trip will be shadowed by Trump's potential return to the White House. The presumptive Republican candidate, who last week became the first U.S. president to be convicted of a crime, has pledged to unravel American commitments to allies in Europe.\n\n\"It's every conversation. Every conversation is, what will happen?\" said Max Bergmann, who leads Europe research at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nBergmann, who was in the middle of a trip around the continent in the days before Biden arrived, said some European officials hope that a second Trump term would be no more damaging than his first, when he failed to follow through on some of his more extreme ideas. But he doubts Trump will be held in check without moderate members of his administration -- such as former Defense Secretary James Mattis -- who are unlikely to return.\n\n\"I'm not reassuring to them,\" Bergmann said.\n\nRachel Rizzo, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said there's a \"palpable sense of uncertainty\" as the United States and Europe wrestle with populist movements that have proven durably popular.\n\n\"This is not an aberration, this is not an accident,\" she said. \"There are real grievances that citizens of both continents have, and they're playing out in support of right-wing parties.\"\n\nIn another complication for Biden, his trip is taking place at the same time that his son, Hunter, is standing trial in Delaware. The younger Biden is accused of lying while purchasing a gun by claiming that he was not a drug addict. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe prosecution began presenting its case Tuesday, just days after Trump became the first U.S. president to be convicted of a felony. Trump was found guilty in New York of making illegal hush money payments to an adult film actress who said they had sex. Trump denies the affair.\n\nPaul Begala, a longtime Democratic strategist, said Biden is probably better off ignoring Trump while he's in France.\n\n\"When you're 81 years old, and three-fourths of the country thinks you're too old, one of the things you have to do is to show strength,\" he said. \"That's what he's got to do over there. He's got to show strength.\"\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "nbcbayarea.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Bay Area"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It is also set against deepening cracks between the U.S. and many European allies over how to manage the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nBiden will arrive in Paris on Wednesday morning. On Thursday, he'll visit hallowed ground near the beaches of Normandy, where rows of bone-white headstones mark the graves of U.S. soldiers who died to bring an end to World War II. He'll also speak on Friday at Pointe du Hoc, a spot on the French coast where Army Rangers scaled seaside cliffs to overcome Nazi defenses.\n\nWhite House National Security adviser Jake Sullivan said aboard Air Force One on the way to France that Biden will stress how the men on those cliffs \"put the country ahead of themselves\" and detail \"the dangers of isolationism, and how, if we back dictators and fail to stand up to them, they keep going and ultimately America and the world pays a greater price.\"\n\n\"Eighty years later, we see dictators once again attempting to challenge the order, attempting to march in Europe,\" Sullivan said, \"and that freedom-loving nations need to rally to stand against that, as we have.\"\n\nHe also said Biden would be meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in France to discuss \"how we can continue and deepen our support for Ukraine.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden boards Air Force One for a trip to France to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day, Tuesday, June 4, 2024, in Andrews Air Force Base, Md. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nOn Saturday, Biden, along with his wife Jill, will be honored by French President Emmanuel Macron with a state visit, including a military parade in Paris and a banquet at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, as well as business sessions where the leaders are to discuss strengthening their alliance, trade, and security cooperation for the upcoming Olympic games.\n\nThe two leaders also are expected to discuss the Middle East. Biden has invested geopolitical capital in brokering a temporary ceasefire to the Israel-Hamas war that would see the release of hostages, even as he has maintained his staunch support for Israel and resisted European efforts to recognize a Palestinian state or investigate Israel over its handling of the war.\n\nBiden is scheduled to return to the United States on Sunday, but before he leaves France he's expected to stop at a cemetery where American soldiers who died in World War I are buried. Trump skipped plans to visit the same site during a 2018 trip to France, a decision that the White House blamed on weather at the time.\n\nHowever, subsequent reporting found that Trump told aides he didn't want to go because he viewed the dead soldiers as \"suckers\" and \"losers.\" He has denied the comments, which Biden referenced during a fundraiser in Greenwich, Conn., on Monday.\n\n\"This guy does not deserve to be president,\" Biden said.\n\nAlthough foreign trips are ostensibly nonpartisan, Biden left no doubt that he sees a political connection between the D-Day anniversary and the election. The president described the invasion as \"one of the most important moments in the history of defense of freedom and democracy.\"\n\n\"I want to say as clearly as I can,\" he added. \"Democracy is literally on the ballot this year.\"\n\nBiden's trip to France will be followed by another to Italy later this month for the annual Group of Seven summit, a rare doubleheader of international diplomacy in the middle of the presidential election season. Biden will skip a subsequent gathering in Switzerland, where leaders will be focused on the war in Ukraine, to attend a campaign fundraiser in Los Angeles with Hollywood stars. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the United States instead.\n\nBiden's travels, plus the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Washington next month, aim to embody a vision of global American leadership that's central to his political identity but faces renewed threat from Trump.\n\nAlthough the two presidents are from the same generation - Biden, 81, was born one and a half years before D-Day; Trump, 77, was born two years after the invasion - they developed divergent views on Europe and American alliances over the years.\n\nFor Biden, U.S. ties to Europe are a cornerstone of stability and a source of strength.

Biden is in France to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nPARIS (AP) -- United States President Joe Biden will mark the 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion in France this week as he tries to demonstrate steadfast support for European security at a time when some allies fear Donald Trump threatens to upend American commitments if he wins another term in the White House.\n\nThe trip comes as the deadliest fighting on the continent since World War II continues in Ukraine and allied countries struggle to find ways to turn the tide against Russia, which has recently gained ground on the battlefield. It is also set against deepening cracks between the U.S. and many European allies over how to manage the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nBiden arrived in Paris this morning, and he was welcomed by French officials and an honor guard. On Thursday, he'll visit hallowed ground near the beaches of Normandy, where rows of bone-white headstones mark the graves of U.S. soldiers who died to bring an end to World War II. He'll also speak on Friday at Pointe du Hoc, a spot on the French coast where Army Rangers scaled seaside cliffs to overcome Nazi defenses.\n\nWhite House National Security adviser Jake Sullivan said aboard Air Force One on the way to France that Biden will stress how the men on those cliffs \"put the country ahead of themselves\" and detail \"the dangers of isolationism, and how, if we back dictators and fail to stand up to them, they keep going and ultimately America and the world pays a greater price.\"\n\n\"Eighty years later, we see dictators once again attempting to challenge the order, attempting to march in Europe,\" Sullivan said, \"and that freedom-loving nations need to rally to stand against that, as we have.\"\n\nHe also said Biden would be meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in France to discuss \"how we can continue and deepen our support for Ukraine.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Biden, along with his wife Jill, will be honored by French President Emmanuel Macron with a state visit, including a military parade in Paris and a banquet at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, as well as business sessions where the leaders are to discuss strengthening their alliance, trade, and security cooperation for the upcoming Olympic games.\n\nThe two leaders also are expected to discuss the Middle East. Biden has invested geopolitical capital in brokering a ceasefire to the Israel-Hamas war that would see the release of hostages, even as he has maintained his staunch support for Israel and resisted European efforts to recognize a Palestinian state or investigate Israel over its handling of the war.\n\nBiden, a Democrat, is scheduled to return to the United States on Sunday, but before he leaves France he's expected to stop at a cemetery where American soldiers who died in World War I are buried. Trump, a Republican, skipped plans to visit the same site during a 2018 trip to France, a decision that the White House blamed on weather at the time.\n\nHowever, subsequent reporting found that Trump told aides he didn't want to go because he viewed the dead soldiers as \"suckers\" and \"losers.\" He has denied the comments, which Biden referenced during a fundraiser in Greenwich, Conn., on Monday.\n\n\"This guy does not deserve to be president,\" Biden said.\n\nAlthough foreign trips are ostensibly nonpartisan, Biden left no doubt that he sees a political connection between the D-Day anniversary and the election. The president described the invasion as \"one of the most important moments in the history of defense of freedom and democracy.\"\n\n\"I want to say as clearly as I can,\" he added. \"Democracy is literally on the ballot this year.\"\n\nBiden's trip to France will be followed by another to Italy later this month for the annual Group of Seven summit, a rare doubleheader of international diplomacy in the middle of the presidential election season. Biden will skip a subsequent gathering in Switzerland, where leaders will be focused on the war in Ukraine, to attend a campaign fundraiser in Los Angeles with Hollywood stars. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the United States instead.\n\nBiden's travels, plus the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Washington next month, aim to embody a vision of global American leadership that's central to his political identity but faces renewed threat from Trump.\n\nAlthough the two presidents are from the same generation -- Biden, 81, was born one and a half years before D-Day; Trump, 77, was born two years after the invasion -- they developed divergent views on Europe and American alliances over the years.\n\nFor Biden, U.S. ties to Europe are a cornerstone of stability and a source of strength. For Trump, they're a drain on precious resources, and he's expressed more affinity for autocratic leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose invasion of Ukraine has upended the continent.\n\nEven before voters decide which vision they prefer, cracks in Biden's foreign policy foundation have emerged. It took months to secure additional military assistance for Ukraine due to GOP resistance, and the delay led to depleted ammunition reserves and Russian advances on the battlefield.\n\n\"All that happened with a die-hard Atlanticist and die-hard alliance supporter in the White House,\" said Charles Kupchan, a Georgetown University professor who previously served as Europe director on President Barack Obama's National Security Council. \"Europeans have no option but to ask how reliable the United States can be.\"\n\nKupchan noted that \"the bipartisan compact behind a steady and robust American internationalism has collapsed.\"\n\nGiven the political complications at home, Kupchan said, Biden should be careful about drawing historical parallels between D-Day and Ukraine while he's in France.\n\n\"I'm not sure that he wants to say that this is a moment like 1940 or 1941,\" he said, especially since Biden has ruled out sending American troops to fight against the Russian invasion.\n\nLike all of his international engagements, Biden's trip will be shadowed by Trump's potential return to the White House. The presumptive Republican candidate, who last week became the first U.S. president to be convicted of a crime, has pledged to unravel American commitments to allies in Europe.\n\n\"It's every conversation. Every conversation is, what will happen?\" said Max Bergmann, who leads Europe research at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nBergmann, who was in the middle of a trip around the continent in the days before Biden arrived, said some European officials hope that a second Trump term would be no more damaging than his first, when he failed to follow through on some of his more extreme ideas. But he doubts Trump will be held in check without moderate members of his administration -- such as former Defense Secretary James Mattis -- who are unlikely to return.\n\n\"I'm not reassuring to them,\" Bergmann said.\n\nRachel Rizzo, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said there's a \"palpable sense of uncertainty\" as the United States and Europe wrestle with populist movements that have proven durably popular.\n\n\"This is not an aberration, this is not an accident,\" she said. \"There are real grievances that citizens of both continents have, and they're playing out in support of right-wing parties.\"\n\nIn another complication for Biden, his trip is taking place at the same time that his son, Hunter, is standing trial in Delaware. The younger Biden is accused of lying while purchasing a gun by claiming that he was not a drug addict. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe prosecution began presenting its case Tuesday, just days after Trump became the first U.S. president to be convicted of a felony. Trump was found guilty in New York of making illegal hush money payments to an adult film actress who said they had sex. Trump denies the affair.\n\nPaul Begala, a longtime Democratic strategist, said Biden is probably better off ignoring Trump while he's in France.\n\n\"When you're 81 years old, and three-fourths of the country thinks you're too old, one of the things you have to do is to show strength,\" he said. \"That's what he's got to do over there. He's got to show strength.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Sylvie Corbett in Paris and Fatima Hussein in Greenwich, Connecticut, contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "tribtoday.com",

The president described the invasion as \"one of the most important moments in the history of defense of freedom and democracy.\"\n\n\"I want to say as clearly as I can,\" he added. \"Democracy is literally on the ballot this year.\"\n\nBiden's trip to France will be followed by another to Italy later this month for the annual Group of Seven summit, a rare doubleheader of international diplomacy in the middle of the presidential election season. Biden will skip a subsequent gathering in Switzerland, where leaders will be focused on the war in Ukraine, to attend a campaign fundraiser in Los Angeles with Hollywood stars. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the United States instead.\n\nBiden's travels, plus the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Washington next month, aim to embody a vision of global American leadership that's central to his political identity but faces renewed threat from Trump.\n\nAlthough the two presidents are from the same generation -- Biden, 81, was born one and a half years before D-Day; Trump, 77, was born two years after the invasion -- they developed divergent views on Europe and American alliances over the years.\n\nFor Biden, U.S. ties to Europe are a cornerstone of stability and a source of strength. For Trump, they're a drain on precious resources, and he's expressed more affinity for autocratic leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose invasion of Ukraine has upended the continent.\n\nEven before voters decide which vision they prefer, cracks in Biden's foreign policy foundation have emerged. It took months to secure additional military assistance for Ukraine due to GOP resistance, and the delay led to depleted ammunition reserves and Russian advances on the battlefield.\n\n\"All that happened with a die-hard Atlanticist and die-hard alliance supporter in the White House,\" said Charles Kupchan, a Georgetown University professor who previously served as Europe director on President Barack Obama's National Security Council. \"Europeans have no option but to ask how reliable the United States can be.\"\n\nKupchan noted that \"the bipartisan compact behind a steady and robust American internationalism has collapsed.\"\n\nGiven the political complications at home, Kupchan said, Biden should be careful about drawing historical parallels between D-Day and Ukraine while he's in France.\n\n\"I'm not sure that he wants to say that this is a moment like 1940 or 1941,\" he said, especially since Biden has ruled out sending American troops to fight against the Russian invasion.\n\nLike all of his international engagements, Biden's trip will be shadowed by Trump's potential return to the White House. The presumptive Republican candidate, who last week became the first U.S. president to be convicted of a crime, has pledged to unravel American commitments to allies in Europe.\n\n\"It's every conversation. Every conversation is, what will happen?\" said Max Bergmann, who leads Europe research at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nBergmann, who was in the middle of a trip around the continent in the days before Biden arrived, said some European officials hope that a second Trump term would be no more damaging than his first, when he failed to follow through on some of his more extreme ideas. But he doubts Trump will be held in check without moderate members of his administration -- such as former Defense Secretary James Mattis -- who are unlikely to return.\n\n\"I'm not reassuring to them,\" Bergmann said.\n\nRachel Rizzo, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said there's a \"palpable sense of uncertainty\" as the United States and Europe wrestle with populist movements that have proven durably popular.\n\n\"This is not an aberration, this is not an accident,\" she said. \"There are real grievances that citizens of both continents have, and they're playing out in support of right-wing parties.\"\n\nIn another complication for Biden, his trip is taking place at the same time that his son, Hunter, is standing trial in Delaware. The younger Biden is accused of lying while purchasing a gun by claiming that he was not a drug addict. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe prosecution began presenting its case Tuesday, just days after Trump became the first U.S. president to be convicted of a felony. Trump was found guilty in New York of making illegal hush money payments to an adult film actress who said they had sex. Trump denies the affair.\n\nPaul Begala, a longtime Democratic strategist, said Biden is probably better off ignoring Trump while he's in France.\n\n\"When you're 81 years old, and three-fourths of the country thinks you're too old, one of the things you have to do is to show strength,\" he said. \"That's what he's got to do over there. He's got to show strength.\"", "source": {"uri": "oneidadispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oneida Dispatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@oneidadispatch.com", "name": "Associated

The issue could hurt Biden in key states, including Michigan, in the November election.\n\nThe D-Day commemorations are set against a backdrop of a modern conflict in Europe, Russia's more than 2-year war with Ukraine.\n\nAt a political fundraiser before his trip, Biden called the D-Day invasion \"one of the most important moments in the history of defense of freedom and democracy in the history of the world\" and said the sacrifices from that day must not be given up.\n\n\"Democracy is literally on the ballot this year. The future of democracy and freedom is at stake. We have brave soldiers who gave their lives on the beaches of Normandy who did their part,\" he told donors in Connecticut on Monday.\n\n(Reporting by Jeff Mason and Paris newsroom; additional reporting by Steve Holland, Eric Beech, Kanishka Singh, Katharine Jackson and Andrea Shalal; Editing by Heather Timmons, Stephen Coates and Michael Perry)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update\n\nYour morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up\n\nView all of our newsletters.\n\nSuccess!

Trump, a Republican, skipped plans to visit the same site during a 2018 trip to France, a decision that the White House blamed on weather at the time.\n\nHowever, subsequent reporting found that Trump told aides he didn't want to go because he viewed the dead soldiers as \"suckers\" and \"losers.\" He has denied the comments, which Biden referenced during a fundraiser in Greenwich, Conn., on Monday.\n\n\"This guy does not deserve to be president,\" Biden said.\n\nAlthough foreign trips are ostensibly nonpartisan, Biden left no doubt that he sees a political connection between the D-Day anniversary and the election.

For Trump, they're a drain on precious resources, and he's expressed more affinity for autocratic leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose invasion of Ukraine has upended the continent.\n\nEven before voters decide which vision they prefer, cracks in Biden's foreign policy foundation have emerged. It took months to secure additional military assistance for Ukraine due to GOP resistance, and the delay led to depleted ammunition reserves and Russian advances on the battlefield.\n\n\"All that happened with a die-hard Atlanticist and die-hard alliance supporter in the White House,\" said Charles Kupchan, a Georgetown University professor who previously served as Europe director on President Barack Obama's National Security Council. \"Europeans have no option but to ask how reliable the United States can be.\"\n\nKupchan noted that \"the bipartisan compact behind a steady and robust American internationalism has collapsed.\"\n\nGiven the political complications at home, Kupchan said, Biden should be careful about drawing historical parallels between D-Day and Ukraine while he's in France.\n\n\"I'm not sure that he wants to say that this is a moment like 1940 or 1941,\" he said, especially since Biden has ruled out sending American troops to fight against the Russian invasion.\n\nLike all of his international engagements, Biden's trip will be shadowed by Trump's potential return to the White House.

It is also set against deepening cracks between the U.S. and many European allies over how to manage the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.Biden arrived in Paris on Wednesday morning, and he was welcomed by French officials and an honor guard. On Thursday, he'll visit hallowed ground near the beaches of Normandy, where rows of bone-white headstones mark the graves of U.S. soldiers who died to bring an end to World War II. He'll also speak on Friday at Pointe du Hoc, a spot on the French coast where Army Rangers scaled seaside cliffs to overcome Nazi defenses.White House National Security adviser Jake Sullivan said aboard Air Force One on the way to France that Biden will stress how the men on those cliffs \"put the country ahead of themselves\" and detail \"the dangers of isolationism, and how, if we back dictators and fail to stand up to them, they keep going and ultimately America and the world pays a greater price.\"\"Eighty years later, we see dictators once again attempting to challenge the order, attempting to march in Europe,\" Sullivan said, \"and that freedom-loving nations need to rally to stand against that, as we have.\"He also said Biden would be meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in France to discuss \"how we can continue and deepen our support for Ukraine.\"On Saturday, Biden, along with First Lady Jill Biden, will be honored by French President Emmanuel Macron with a state visit, including a military parade in Paris and a banquet at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, as well as business sessions where the leaders are to discuss strengthening their alliance, trade, and security cooperation for the upcoming Olympic games.The two leaders also are expected to discuss the Middle East. Biden has invested geopolitical capital in brokering a ceasefire to the Israel-Hamas war that would see the release of hostages, even as he has maintained his staunch support for Israel and resisted European efforts to recognize a Palestinian state or investigate Israel over its handling of the war.Biden, is scheduled to return to the United States on Sunday, but before he leaves France he's expected to stop at a cemetery where American soldiers who died in World War I are buried. Donald Trump skipped plans to visit the same site during a 2018 presidential trip to France, a decision that the White House blamed on weather at the time.However, subsequent reporting found that Trump told aides he didn't want to go because he viewed the dead soldiers as \"suckers\" and \"losers.\" He has denied the comments, which Biden referenced during a fundraiser in Greenwich, Conn., on Monday.\"This guy does not deserve to be president,\" Biden said.Although foreign trips are ostensibly nonpartisan, Biden left no doubt that he sees a political connection between the D-Day anniversary and the election. The president described the invasion as \"one of the most important moments in the history of defense of freedom and democracy.\"\"I want to say as clearly as I can,\" he added. \"Democracy is literally on the ballot this year.\"Biden's trip to France will be followed by another to Italy later this month for the annual Group of Seven summit, a rare doubleheader of international diplomacy in the middle of the presidential election season. Biden will skip a subsequent gathering in Switzerland, where leaders will be focused on the war in Ukraine, to attend a campaign fundraiser in Los Angeles with Hollywood stars. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the United States instead.Biden's travels, plus the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Washington next month, aim to embody a vision of global American leadership that's central to his political identity but faces renewed threat from Trump.Although the two presidents are from the same generation -- Biden, 81, was born one and a half years before D-Day; Trump, 77, was born two years after the invasion -- they developed divergent views on Europe and American alliances over the years.For Biden, U.S. ties to Europe are a cornerstone of stability and a source of strength. For Trump, they're a drain on precious resources, and he's expressed more affinity for autocratic leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose invasion of Ukraine has upended the continent.Even before voters decide which vision they prefer, cracks in Biden's foreign policy foundation have emerged. It took months to secure additional military assistance for Ukraine due to GOP resistance, and the delay led to depleted ammunition reserves and Russian advances on the battlefield.\"All that happened with a die-hard Atlanticist and die-hard alliance supporter in the White House,\" said Charles Kupchan, a Georgetown University professor who previously served as Europe director on President Barack Obama's National Security Council. \"Europeans have no option but to ask how reliable the United States can be.\"Kupchan noted that \"the bipartisan compact behind a steady and robust American internationalism has collapsed.\"Given the political complications at home, Kupchan said, Biden should be careful about drawing historical parallels between D-Day and Ukraine while he's in France.\"I'm not sure that he wants to say that this is a moment like 1940 or 1941,\" he said, especially since Biden has ruled out sending American troops to fight against the Russian invasion.Like all of his international engagements, Biden's trip will be shadowed by Trump's potential return to the White House. The presumptive Republican candidate, who last week became the first U.S. president to be convicted of a crime, has pledged to unravel American commitments to allies in Europe.\"It's every conversation. Every conversation is, what will happen?\" said Max Bergmann, who leads Europe research at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Bergmann, who was in the middle of a trip around the continent in the days before Biden arrived, said some European officials hope that a second Trump term would be no more damaging than his first, when he failed to follow through on some of his more extreme ideas. But he doubts Trump will be held in check without moderate members of his administration -- such as former Defense Secretary James Mattis -- who are unlikely to return.\"I'm not reassuring to them,\" Bergmann said.Rachel Rizzo, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said there's a \"palpable sense of uncertainty\" as the United States and Europe wrestle with populist movements that have proven durably popular.\"This is not an aberration, this is not an accident,\" she said. \"There are real grievances that citizens of both continents have, and they're playing out in support of right-wing parties.\"In another complication for Biden, his trip is taking place at the same time that his son, Hunter, is standing trial in Delaware. The younger Biden is accused of lying while purchasing a gun by claiming that he was not a drug addict. He has pleaded not guilty.The prosecution began presenting its case Tuesday, just days after Trump became the first U.S. president to be convicted of a felony. Trump was found guilty in New York of making illegal hush money payments to an adult film actress who said they had sex. Trump denies the affair.Paul Begala, a longtime Democratic strategist, said Biden is probably better off ignoring Trump while he's in France.\"When you're 81 years old, and three-fourths of the country thinks you're too old, one of the things you have to do is to show strength,\" he said. \"That's what he's got to do over there. He's got to show strength.\"___Associated Press writers Sylvie Corbett in Paris and Fatima Hussein in Greenwich, Connecticut, contributed to this report.\n\nPresident Joe Biden will mark the 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion in France this week as he tries to demonstrate steadfast support for European security.\n\nThe trip comes as the deadliest fighting on the continent since World War II continues in Ukraine and allied countries struggle to find ways to turn the tide against Russia, which has recently gained ground on the battlefield.

It is also set against deepening cracks between the U.S. and many European allies over how to manage the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nBiden arrived in Paris on Wednesday morning, and he was welcomed by French officials and an honor guard. On Thursday, he'll visit hallowed ground near the beaches of Normandy, where rows of bone-white headstones mark the graves of U.S. soldiers who died to bring an end to World War II. He'll also speak on Friday at Pointe du Hoc, a spot on the French coast where Army Rangers scaled seaside cliffs to overcome Nazi defenses.\n\nWhite House National Security adviser Jake Sullivan said aboard Air Force One on the way to France that Biden will stress how the men on those cliffs \"put the country ahead of themselves\" and detail \"the dangers of isolationism, and how, if we bow to dictators and fail to stand up to them, they keep going and ultimately America and the world pays a greater price.\"\n\n\"Eighty years later, we see dictators once again attempting to challenge the order, attempting to march in Europe,\" Sullivan said, \"and that freedom-loving nations need to rally to stand against that, as we have.\"\n\nHe also said Biden would be meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in France to discuss \"how we can continue and deepen our support for Ukraine.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Biden, along with his wife Jill, will be honored by French President Emmanuel Macron with a state visit, including a military parade in Paris and a banquet at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, as well as business sessions where the leaders are to discuss strengthening their alliance, trade, and security cooperation for the upcoming Olympic games.\n\nThe two leaders also are expected to discuss the Middle East. Biden has invested geopolitical capital in brokering a ceasefire to the Israel-Hamas war that would see the release of hostages, even as he has maintained his staunch support for Israel and resisted European efforts to recognize a Palestinian state or investigate Israel over its handling of the war.\n\nBiden, a Democrat, is scheduled to return to the United States on Sunday, but before he leaves France he's expected to stop at a cemetery where American soldiers who died in World War I are buried. Trump, a Republican, skipped plans to visit the same site during a 2018 trip to France, a decision that the White House blamed on weather at the time.\n\nHowever, subsequent reporting found that Trump told aides he didn't want to go because he viewed the dead soldiers as \"suckers\" and \"losers.\" He has denied the comments, which Biden referenced during a fundraiser in Greenwich, Conn., on Monday.\n\n\"This guy does not deserve to be president,\" Biden said.\n\nAlthough foreign trips are ostensibly nonpartisan, Biden left no doubt that he sees a political connection between the D-Day anniversary and the election. The president described the invasion as \"one of the most important moments in the history of defense of freedom and democracy.\"\n\n\"I want to say as clearly as I can,\" he added. \"Democracy is literally on the ballot this year.\"\n\nBiden's trip to France will be followed by another to Italy later this month for the annual Group of Seven summit, a rare doubleheader of international diplomacy in the middle of the presidential election season. Biden will skip a subsequent gathering in Switzerland, where leaders will be focused on the war in Ukraine, to attend a campaign fundraiser in Los Angeles with Hollywood stars. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the United States instead.\n\nBiden's travels, plus the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Washington next month, aim to embody a vision of global

For Trump, they're a drain on precious resources, and he's expressed more affinity for autocratic leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose invasion of Ukraine has upended the continent.\n\nEven before voters decide which vision they prefer, cracks in Biden's foreign policy foundation have emerged. It took months to secure additional military assistance for Ukraine due to GOP resistance, and the delay led to depleted ammunition reserves and Russian advances on the battlefield.\n\n\"All that happened with a die-hard Atlanticist and die-hard alliance supporter in the White House,\" said Charles Kupchan, a Georgetown University professor who previously served as Europe director on President Barack Obama's National Security Council. \"Europeans have no option but to ask how reliable the United States can be.\"\n\nKupchan noted that \"the bipartisan compact behind a steady and robust American internationalism has collapsed.\"\n\nGiven the political complications at home, Kupchan said, Biden should be careful about drawing historical parallels between D-Day and Ukraine while he's in France.\n\n\"I'm not sure that he wants to say that this is a moment like 1940 or 1941,\" he said, especially since Biden has ruled out sending American troops to fight against the Russian invasion.\n\nLike all of his international engagements, Biden's trip will be shadowed by Trump's potential return to the White House. The presumptive Republican candidate, who last week became the first US president to be convicted of a crime, has pledged to unravel American commitments to allies in Europe.\n\n\"It's every conversation.

The trip underscores his commitment to U.S. allies and contrasts his vision of democracy with political opponent Donald Trump. Discussions with President Macron will include aiding Ukraine and the potential use of frozen Russian assets.\n\nPresident Joe Biden heads to France on Tuesday to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day on a trip designed to underscore his commitment to U.S. allies in Europe and contrast his vision of democracy with his 2024 political opponent, Donald Trump.\n\nBiden departs on Tuesday evening for five days in France that will include D-Day celebrations in Normandy, where U.S. and allied forces stormed French beaches in an attack that helped defeat Nazi Germany in World War II, as well as a high-profile speech and a formal state visit with President Emmanuel Macron. \"That war (WWII) showed the world the value of strong alliances and partnerships, which is a lesson that continues to resonate today in Europe and well beyond,\" White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nKirby said the potential use of some $300 billion in frozen Russian assets to aid Ukraine would be discussed by Biden and Macron during the visit. Biden, a Democrat, is running for re-election in November against Trump, a Republican, and has made preserving and strengthening U.S. democracy a key part of his campaign in the aftermath of Trump's chaotic four years in office.\n\nTrump refused to accept the results of the 2020 election, which sparked a deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters on January 6, 2021; he has vowed to go after political opponents, deport immigrants and punish whistleblowers in a second term. Trump has threatened to abandon NATO allies if they do not bolster their defense spending and some fear he would pull the United States out of the alliance altogether if he were elected president again.\n\nBiden's message on democracy is complicated by his staunch backing of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu in Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, after Hamas attacked Israel in October last year, killing over one thousand. The International Criminal Court has charged Netanyahu with war crimes and some international allies and left-leaning voters in the United States want Biden to stop the flow of U.S. military aid to Israel. The issue could hurt Biden in key states, including Michigan, in the November election.\n\nThe D-Day commemorations are set against a backdrop of a modern conflict in Europe, Russia's more than 2-year war with Ukraine. At a political fundraiser before his trip, Biden called the D-Day invasion \"one of the most important moments in the history of defense of freedom and democracy in the history of the world\" and said the sacrifices from that day must not be given up.\n\n\"Democracy is literally on the ballot this year. The future of democracy and freedom is at stake. We have brave soldiers who gave their lives on the beaches of Normandy who did their part,\" he told donors in Connecticut on Monday.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is

On Thursday, he'll visit hallowed ground near the beaches of Normandy, where rows of bone-white headstones mark the graves of U.S. soldiers who died to bring an end to World War II. He'll also speak on Friday at Pointe du Hoc, a spot on the French coast where Army Rangers scaled seaside cliffs to overcome Nazi defenses.\n\nWhite House National Security adviser Jake Sullivan said aboard Air Force One on the way to France that Biden will stress how the men on those cliffs \"put the country ahead of themselves\" and detail \"the dangers of isolationism, and how, if we back dictators and fail to stand up to them, they keep going and ultimately America and the world pays a greater price.\"\n\n\"Eighty years later, we see dictators once again attempting to challenge the order, attempting to march in Europe,\" Sullivan said, \"and that freedom-loving nations need to rally to stand against that, as we have.\"\n\nHe also said Biden would be meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in France to discuss \"how we can continue and deepen our support for Ukraine.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Biden, along with his wife Jill, will be honored by French President Emmanuel Macron with a state visit, including a military parade in Paris and a banquet at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, as well as business sessions where the leaders are to discuss strengthening their alliance, trade, and security cooperation for the upcoming Olympic games.\n\nThe two leaders also are expected to discuss the Middle East. Biden has invested geopolitical capital in brokering a temporary ceasefire to the Israel-Hamas war that would see the release of hostages, even as he has maintained his staunch support for Israel and resisted European efforts to recognize a Palestinian state or investigate Israel over its handling of the war.\n\nBiden is scheduled to return to the United States on Sunday, but before he leaves France he's expected to stop at a cemetery where American soldiers who died in World War I are buried. Trump skipped plans to visit the same site during a 2018 trip to France, a decision that the White House blamed on weather at the time.\n\nHowever, subsequent reporting found that Trump told aides he didn't want to go because he viewed the dead soldiers as \"suckers\" and \"losers.\" He has denied the comments, which Biden referenced during a fundraiser in Greenwich, Conn., on Monday.\n\n\"This guy does not deserve to be president,\" Biden said.\n\nAlthough foreign trips are ostensibly nonpartisan, Biden left no doubt that he sees a political connection between the D-Day anniversary and the election. The president described the invasion as \"one of the most important moments in the history of defense of freedom and democracy.\"\n\n\"I want to say as clearly as I can,\" he added. \"Democracy is literally on the ballot this year.\"\n\nBiden's trip to France will be followed by another to Italy later this month for the annual Group of Seven summit, a rare doubleheader of international diplomacy in the middle of the presidential election season. Biden will skip a subsequent gathering in Switzerland, where leaders will be focused on the war in Ukraine, to attend a campaign fundraiser in Los Angeles with Hollywood stars. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the United States instead.\n\nBiden's travels, plus the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Washington next month, aim to embody a vision of global American leadership that's central to his political identity but faces renewed threat from Trump.\n\nAlthough the two presidents are from the same generation -- Biden, 81, was born one and a half years before D-Day; Trump, 77, was born two years after the invasion -- they developed divergent views on Europe and American alliances over the years.\n\nFor Biden, U.S. ties to Europe are a cornerstone of stability and a source of strength. For Trump, they're a drain on precious resources, and he's expressed more affinity for autocratic leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose invasion of Ukraine has upended the continent.\n\nEven before voters decide which vision they prefer, cracks in Biden's foreign policy foundation have emerged. It took months to secure additional military assistance for Ukraine due to GOP resistance, and the delay led to depleted ammunition reserves and Russian advances on the battlefield.\n\n\"All that happened with a die-hard Atlanticist and die-hard alliance supporter in the White House,\" said Charles Kupchan, a Georgetown University professor who previously served as Europe director on President Barack Obama's National Security Council. \"Europeans have no option but to ask how reliable the United States can be.\"\n\nKupchan noted that \"the bipartisan compact behind a steady and robust American internationalism has collapsed.\"\n\nGiven the political complications at home, Kupchan said, Biden should be careful about drawing historical parallels between D-Day and Ukraine while he's in France.\n\n\"I'm not sure that he wants to say that this is a moment like 1940 or 1941,\" he said, especially since Biden has ruled out sending American troops to fight against the Russian invasion.\n\nLike all of his international engagements, Biden's trip will be shadowed by Trump's potential return to the White House. The presumptive Republican candidate, who last week became the first U.S. president to be convicted of a crime, has pledged to unravel American commitments to allies in Europe.\n\n\"It's every conversation. Every conversation is, what will happen?\" said Max Bergmann, who leads Europe research at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nBergmann, who was in the middle of a trip around the continent in the days before Biden arrived, said some European officials hope that a second Trump term would be no more damaging than his first, when he failed to follow through on some of his more extreme ideas. But he doubts Trump will be held in check without moderate members of his administration -- such as former Defense Secretary James Mattis -- who are unlikely to return.\n\n\"I'm not reassuring to them,\" Bergmann said.\n\nRachel Rizzo, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said there's a \"palpable sense of uncertainty\" as the United States and Europe wrestle with populist movements that have proven durably popular.\n\n\"This is not an aberration, this is not an accident,\" she said. \"There are real grievances that citizens of both continents have, and they're playing out in support of right-wing parties.\"\n\nIn another complication for Biden, his trip is taking place at the same time that his son, Hunter, is standing trial in Delaware. The younger Biden is accused of lying while purchasing a gun by claiming that he was not a drug addict. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe prosecution began presenting its case Tuesday, just days after Trump became the first U.S. president to be convicted of a felony. Trump was found guilty in New York of making illegal hush money payments to an adult film actress who said they had sex. Trump denies the affair.\n\nPaul Begala, a longtime Democratic strategist, said Biden is probably better off ignoring Trump while he's in France.\n\n\"When you're 81 years old, and three-fourths of the country thinks you're too old, one of the things you have to do is to show strength,\" he said. \"That's what he's got to do over there. He's got to show strength.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan",

The issue could hurt Biden in key states, including Michigan, in the November election.\n\nThe D-Day commemorations are set against a backdrop of a modern conflict in Europe, Russia's more than 2-year war with Ukraine.\n\nAt a political fundraiser before his trip, Biden called the D-Day invasion \"one of the most important moments in the history of defense of freedom and democracy in the history of the world\" and said the sacrifices from that day must not be given up.\n\n\"Democracy is literally on the ballot this year. The future of democracy and freedom is at stake. We have brave soldiers who gave their lives on the beaches of Normandy who did their part,\" he told donors in Connecticut on Monday.\n\nReporting by Jeff Mason; additional reporting by Steve Holland, Eric Beech, Kanishka Singh, Katharine Jackson and Andrea Shalal; Editing by Heather Timmons, Stephen Coates and Michael Perry\n\nJeff Mason\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nJeff Mason is a White House Correspondent for Reuters.

It is also set against deepening cracks between the U.S. and many European allies over how to manage the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nBiden will arrive in Paris on Wednesday morning. On Thursday, he'll visit hallowed ground near the beaches of Normandy, where rows of bone-white headstones mark the graves of U.S. soldiers who died to bring an end to World War II. He'll also speak on Friday at Pointe du Hoc, a spot on the French coast where Army Rangers scaled seaside cliffs to overcome Nazi defenses.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWhite House National Security adviser Jake Sullivan said aboard Air Force One on the way to France that Biden will stress how the men on those cliffs \"put the country ahead of themselves\" and detail \"the dangers of isolationism, and how, if we back dictators and fail to stand up to them, they keep going and ultimately America and the world pays a greater price.\"\n\n\"Eighty years later, we see dictators once again attempting to challenge the order, attempting to march in Europe,\" Sullivan said, \"and that freedom-loving nations need to rally to stand against that, as we have.\"\n\nHe also said Biden would be meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in France to discuss \"how we can continue and deepen our support for Ukraine.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Biden, along with his wife Jill, will be honored by French President Emmanuel Macron with a state visit, including a military parade in Paris and a banquet at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, as well as business sessions where the leaders are to discuss strengthening their alliance, trade, and security cooperation for the upcoming Olympic games.\n\nThe two leaders also are expected to discuss the Middle East. Biden has invested geopolitical capital in brokering a temporary ceasefire to the Israel-Hamas war that would see the release of hostages, even as he has maintained his staunch support for Israel and resisted European efforts to recognize a Palestinian state or investigate Israel over its handling of the war.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBiden is scheduled to return to the United States on Sunday, but before he leaves France he's expected to stop at a cemetery where American soldiers who died in World War I are buried. Trump skipped plans to visit the same site during a 2018 trip to France, a decision that the White House blamed on weather at the time.\n\nHowever, subsequent reporting found that Trump told aides he didn't want to go because he viewed the dead soldiers as \"suckers\" and \"losers.\" He has denied the comments, which Biden referenced during a fundraiser in Greenwich, Conn., on Monday.\n\n\"This guy does not deserve to be president,\" Biden said.\n\nAlthough foreign trips are ostensibly nonpartisan, Biden left no doubt that he sees a political connection between the D-Day anniversary and the election. The president described the invasion as \"one of the most important moments in the history of defense of freedom and democracy.\"\n\n\"I want to say as clearly as I can,\" he added. \"Democracy is literally on the ballot this year.\"\n\nBiden's trip to France will be followed by another to Italy later this month for the annual Group of Seven summit, a rare doubleheader of international diplomacy in the middle of the presidential election season. Biden will skip a subsequent gathering in Switzerland, where leaders will be focused on the war in Ukraine, to attend a campaign fundraiser in Los Angeles with Hollywood stars. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the United States instead.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBiden's travels, plus the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Washington next month, aim to embody a vision of global American leadership that's central to his political identity but faces renewed threat from Trump.\n\nAlthough the two presidents are from the same generation -- Biden, 81, was born one and a half years before D-Day; Trump, 77, was born two years after the invasion -- they developed divergent views on Europe and American alliances over the years.\n\nFor Biden, U.S. ties to Europe are a cornerstone of stability and a source of strength. For Trump, they're a drain on precious resources, and he's expressed more affinity for autocratic leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose invasion of Ukraine has upended the continent.\n\nEven before voters decide which vision they prefer, cracks in Biden's foreign policy foundation have emerged. It took months to secure additional military assistance for Ukraine due to GOP resistance, and the delay led to depleted ammunition reserves and Russian advances on the battlefield.\n\n\"All that happened with a die-hard Atlanticist and die-hard alliance supporter in the White House,\" said Charles Kupchan, a Georgetown University professor who previously served as Europe director on President Barack Obama's National Security Council. \"Europeans have no option but to ask how reliable the United States can be.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nKupchan noted that \"the bipartisan compact behind a steady and robust American internationalism has collapsed.\"\n\nGiven the political complications at home, Kupchan said, Biden should be careful about drawing historical parallels between D-Day and Ukraine while he's in France.\n\n\"I'm not sure that he wants to say that this is a moment like 1940 or 1941,\" he said, especially since Biden has ruled out sending American troops to fight against the Russian invasion.\n\nLike all of his international engagements, Biden's trip will be shadowed by Trump's potential return to the White House. The presumptive Republican candidate, who last week became the first U.S. president to be convicted of a crime, has pledged to unravel American commitments to allies in Europe.\n\n\"It's every conversation. Every conversation is, what will happen?\" said Max Bergmann, who leads Europe research at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBergmann, who was in the middle of a trip around the continent in the days before Biden arrived, said some European officials hope that a second Trump term would be no more damaging than his first, when he failed to follow through on some of his more extreme ideas. But he doubts Trump will be held in check without moderate members of his administration -- such as former Defense Secretary James Mattis -- who are unlikely to return.\n\n\"I'm not reassuring to them,\" Bergmann said.\n\nRachel Rizzo, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said there's a \"palpable sense of uncertainty\" as the United States and Europe wrestle with populist movements that have proven durably popular.\n\n\"This is not an aberration, this is not an accident,\" she said. \"There are real grievances that citizens of both continents have, and they're playing out in support of right-wing parties.\"\n\nIn another complication for Biden, his trip is taking place at the same time that his son, Hunter, is standing trial in Delaware. The younger Biden is accused of lying while purchasing a gun by claiming that he was not a drug addict.

The issue could hurt Biden in key states, including Michigan, in the November election.\n\nThe D-Day commemorations are set against a backdrop of a modern conflict in Europe, Russia's more than 2-year war with Ukraine.\n\nAt a political fundraiser before his trip, Biden called the D-Day invasion \"one of the most important moments in the history of defense of freedom and democracy in the history of the world\" and said the sacrifices from that day must not be given up.\n\n\"Democracy is literally on the ballot this year. The future of democracy and freedom is at stake. We have brave soldiers who gave their lives on the beaches of Normandy who did their part,\" he told donors in Connecticut on Monday.\n\n(Reporting by Jeff Mason; additional reporting by Katharine Jackson and Andrea Shalal; Editing by Heather Timmons and Stephen Coates)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The trip also marks Biden's first state visit to France.\n\nThe historic D-Day operation included nearly 160,000 troops from Britain, the U.S., Canada and other nations, and helped lead to the defeat of Nazi Germany. On Thursday, Biden is expected to deliver remarks at a ceremony in Normandy commemorating the event, and to participate in a wreath-laying. At least 25 heads of state are expected to be in France to mark the occasion.\n\nThe anniversary provides the perfect opportunity for Biden to weave together symbolism with policy and politics. Along with falling in the midst of his reelection campaign - and offering him opportunities to contrast with his opponent, former President Donald Trump - the visit to America's oldest ally comes as Russia's invasion of Ukraine is in its second year, the humanitarian crisis in the Middle East continues to escalate and China looms large over Taiwan, threatening its independence.\n\nWorld War II \"showed the world the value of strong alliances and partnerships, which is a lesson that continues to resonate strongly today, both in Europe and, quite frankly, well beyond Europe,\" John Kirby, White House national security communications advisor, told reporters earlier this week during a preview of Biden's trip.\n\n\"President Biden has made revitalizing our relationships a key priority, recognizing that we are stronger when we act together and that today's challenges require global perspectives, global approaches, global responses, and multilateral effort and cooperation,\" Kirby said. \"France is our oldest ally, and this visit will underscore continued U.S.-French leadership on a range of consequential global issues.\"\n\nBiden, who will be in France for five days, is also scheduled to deliver remarks Friday at Pointe Du Hoc - where American soldiers on D-Day scaled cliffs to seize German artillery. He's expected to focus on the importance of fighting for democracy.\n\n\"You can point to real lives that were impacted at Pointe du Hoc,\" Kirby said. \"You can point to real blood that was spilt in pursuit of that loftier goal. And you can tell stories about real men who climbed real cliffs and faced real bullets and real danger in the pursuit of something a whole hell of a lot bigger than themselves.\"\n\nFollowing the anniversary commemorations, French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, will host Biden and First Lady Jill Biden for the state visit. During a bilateral meeting between Biden and Macron, the two presidents will discuss continuing to support Ukraine, the war in Gaza and efforts to combat climate change, Kirby said.\n\nMacron is reportedly weighing sending French military trainers to Ukraine - a potential move that's sparked concern among some allies as it could lead to increased tensions with Russia. Notably, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be in France this week as well, and is expected to meet with both Macron and Biden.\n\nBiden follows a long line of U.S. presidents who have visited France to commemorate D-Day. His trip comes 40 years after former President Ronald Reagan's famous speech at Pointe du Hoc, where he stressed the importance of allies.\n\n\"We in America have learned bitter lessons from two World Wars: It is better to be here ready to protect the peace, than to take blind shelter across the sea, rushing to respond only after freedom is lost. We've learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments with an expansionist intent,\" Reagan said during remarks on the 40th anniversary of D-Day.\n\nIn the background of Biden's trip, of course, is the 2024 presidential election - the outcome of which could impact the relationship between the U.S., France and other NATO allies. Trump, for example, has repeatedly called out NATO members for not devoting enough money to defense, and has threatened not to come to the aid of those who don't meet the alliance's defense spending target - something he's also sought to frame as a negotiating tactic.\n\nWhile in France, Biden also plans to speak with U.S. and international veterans who served in World War II, and to visit a cemetery honoring fallen American soldiers during World War I. During a Trump trip to France in 2018, the former president did not visit the WWI Aisne-Marne American Cemetery due to what the White House at the time said was poor weather. Later reporting from The Atlantic said Trump criticized the dead buried there as \"losers,\" which Trump denied.", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World

It is also set against deepening cracks between the U.S. and many European allies over how to manage the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nBiden arrived Wednesday morning in Paris, and he was welcomed by French officials and an honor guard.\n\nOn Thursday, he'll visit hallowed ground near the beaches of Normandy, where rows of bone-white headstones mark the graves of U.S. soldiers who died to bring an end to World War II.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Biden invested geopolitical capital in brokering a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war that would see the release of hostages, even as he maintained his staunch support for Israel and resisted European efforts to recognize a Palestinian state or investigate Israel over its handling of the war.\n\nThe Democrat is scheduled to return to the U.S. on Sunday. Before he leaves France, he's expected to stop at a cemetery where American soldiers who died in World War I are buried. Trump, a Republican, skipped plans to visit the same site during a 2018 trip, a decision the White House blamed on weather.\n\nHowever, subsequent reporting found that Trump told aides he didn't want to go because he viewed the dead soldiers as \"suckers\" and \"losers.\" He denied the comments, which Biden referenced during a fundraiser Monday in Greenwich, Conn.\n\n\"This guy does not deserve to be president,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden left no doubt that he sees a political connection between the D-Day anniversary and the election. The president described the invasion as \"one of the most important moments in the history of defense of freedom and democracy.\"\n\n\"I want to say as clearly as I can,\" he added. \"Democracy is literally on the ballot this year.\"\n\nBiden's trip to France will be followed by another to Italy later this month for the annual Group of Seven summit. Biden will skip a subsequent gathering in Switzerland, where leaders will focus on the war in Ukraine, to attend a campaign fundraiser in Los Angeles. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. instead.\n\nBiden's travels, plus the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Washington next month, aim to embody a vision of global American leadership that's central to his political identity but faces renewed threat from Trump.\n\nThough the two presidents are from the same generation -- Biden, 81, was born one and a half years before D-Day; Trump, 77, was born two years after the invasion -- they developed divergent views on Europe and American alliances over the years.\n\nFor Biden, U.S. ties to Europe are a cornerstone of stability and a source of strength. For Trump, they're a drain on resources, and he's expressed more affinity for autocratic leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose invasion of Ukraine upended the continent.\n\nCracks in Biden's foreign policy foundation emerged. It took months to secure additional military assistance for Ukraine due to GOP resistance, and the delay led to depleted ammunition reserves and Russian advances on the battlefield.\n\nLike all of his international engagements, Biden's trip will be shadowed by Trump's potential return to the White House. The presumptive Republican candidate, who last week became the first U.S. president to be convicted of a crime, pledged to unravel American commitments to allies in Europe.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny

It's filled with losers.\"\n\nAn angry Biden has repeatedly brought up those comments in election campaign speeches -- not least because his own son Beau had served in the military and he blamed his son's death of brain cancer at age 46 in 2015 on toxins from army burn pits in Iraq.\n\n- 'Defending freedom' -\n\nBiden will also take part in the international ceremony marking the D-Day landings on June 6, 1944, on Omaha Beach in Normandy.\n\nLater in the week he will meet French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris for a visit featuring a welcome ceremony, military parade and working dinner, followed by a joint press conference.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and US President Joe Biden toast during a White House state dinner in December 2022\n\nIt will finish with a grand state dinner, with Macron returning the compliment after Biden treated him to the same honor in Washington in December 2022.\n\nThe White House said the two leaders would make an announcement on cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, where China is increasingly assertive, as well as on the energy transition and nuclear energy.\n\nBut on Friday Biden has carved out time for a speech whose real audience is at home in the United States.\n\nBiden will speak about \"the importance of defending freedom and democracy\" at Pointe du Hoc, a promontory overlooking Omaha Beach taken by US Rangers in one of the fiercest battles on D-Day.\n\nForty years ago President Ronald Reagan used the same location to proclaim that democracy was worth dying for \"because it's the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised by man.\"\n\nThe Republican also took aim at the then Soviet Union in that speech. In 2024 his words echo Biden's determination to support Ukraine against Russia's invasion.\n\nThe graves at the American cemetery of Colleville-sur-Mer, northwestern France are seen in March 2024\n\nBut Biden's words will also clearly be aimed at Trump.\n\nBiden has repeatedly called his rival a threat to democracy over Trump's refusal to accept the 2020 election results, his support for the January 6, 2021 Capitol rioters, and his repeated hints at unrest if he loses a second election.\n\n\"Something snapped in this guy\" after 2020, Biden told a fundraiser earlier this week, in which he also branded Trump a \"convicted felon\" after the Republican was found guilty in his criminal hush money trial.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily

He started with the image of President Franklin Roosevelt in early 1941, months before the attack on Pearl Harbor that would draw the United States into World War II.\n\n\"President Roosevelt's purpose was to wake up Congress and alert the American people that this was no ordinary time,\" said Biden, delivering his remarks in the same House chamber where Roosevelt had spoken. \"Freedom and democracy were under assault in the world.\"\n\nThe United States was still on the sidelines in the war at that point. But Hitler was on the march in Europe, and American allies were under attack. Like then, Biden argued, this is no ordinary time.\n\n\"What makes our moment rare is that freedom and democracy are under attack both at home and overseas at the very same time,\" said Biden.\n\nBiden is giving a speech from Pointe du Hoc\n\nExpect Biden to expand on those themes in an address to the American people he's set to deliver from Pointe du Hoc, overlooking the beaches where the Americans landed on June 6, 1944. More than 70,000 American troops joined allied forces for the dangerous and daring D-Day operation. Casualties were heavy, with 2,500 Americans killed on D-Day itself and some 29,000 more in the Battle of Normandy that followed.\n\nWhile Biden's address isn't a campaign speech, the undercurrent will be unavoidable. Biden has framed his reelection campaign against former President Donald Trump in stark terms, as he did at a fundraiser in New York earlier this week.\n\n\"What those soldiers died for should never be given up,\" said Biden. \"Democracy is literally on the ballot this year.\"\n\nAsked whether this speech about democracy and freedom was aimed at Trump, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said it would focus on universal themes. \"Principles that have served as the foundation of American security and American democracy for generations, including the generation that scaled those cliffs, including today's generation, including the next generation,\" Sullivan told reporters traveling with Biden on Air Force One. \"He's going to be speaking in terms of principles and values and lessons from history that are applicable today.\"\n\nTrump has questioned the value of the NATO alliance\n\nBiden, who describes Trump as an existential threat to America's place as a global leader, takes pride in marshalling U.S. allies to support Ukraine after Russia's invasion, and expanding NATO to include two new members.\n\nWhile at the international commemoration of D-Day on Thursday, Biden is scheduled to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the leaders will discuss the state of play in the war with Russia, Sullivan said. Biden recently authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied weapons to strike inside Russia, an escalation as the war grinds into its third year.\n\nRepublicans in the Trump wing of the Republican party have questioned the utility of ongoing U.S. support for Ukraine. And Trump himself has repeatedly toyed with the idea of the U.S. not keeping its commitment to the NATO alliance.\n\nDuring a campaign rally in February, Trump said America would not defend allies that did not spend enough money on their own defense, should Russia attack them. \"In fact. I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want,\" Trump said.\n\nThe NATO alliance and its commitment to mutual defense grew out of the experience of World War II. And polling from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs finds the majority of Americans still support that alliance.\n\n\"We have understood for so long now since D-Day really, that our security, our prosperity and our freedom depends on the security, prosperity and freedom of our allies around the world,\" said Ivo Daalder, who heads the Chicago Council and was the U.S. ambassador to NATO during the Obama administration.\n\nBut Daalder says isolationist views are growing. \"NATO is becoming politicized in a way it never was until this point.\" said Daalder.\n\nWhat Reagan said at the same spot Biden will deliver his speech\n\nThere's a massive gulf between Trump's message today and the one then-President Ronald Reagan delivered 40 years ago at a D-Day ceremony in Normandy.\n\n\"We in America have learned bitter lessons from two World Wars. It is better to be here ready to protect the peace than to take blind shelter across the sea, rushing to respond only after freedom is lost,\" Reagan said then. \"We've learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments with expansionist intent.\"\n\nA lot has changed since 1984. The Berlin Wall fell. The Cold War ended. The Soviet Union dissolved, only for Russian President Vladimir Putin to decades later attempt to rebuild it.\n\nThere are echoes of that Reagan speech in the way Biden describes Putin and his war in Ukraine. But many people aren't buying that argument.\n\n\"You could feel the loss of understanding at the end of the Cold War of what our allies were for,\" said Heather Conley, director of the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\nConley is in the midst of a tour of the country, trying to make the case for continued U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

So he's going to be speaking in in terms of principles and values and lessons from history that are applicable today,' Sullivan said.\n\nHe arrived in France on Wednesday, wearing his signature aviator sunglasses as he disembarked from Air Force One. He will spend the day in Paris, meeting with staff.\n\nHe heads to Normandy on Thursday where he will meet with Zelensky there and again on the sidelines of the G7 in Italy next week.\n\nThe meeting comes after Biden approved Ukraine using American-provided weapons in Russia as President Vladimir Putin has stepped up his campaign there.\n\nPresident Biden was welcomed by France's Prime Minister Gabriel Attal\n\nPresident Joe Biden left for France on Tuesday; Jill Biden is traveling separately\n\nTo further make his point about the threats to freedom, Biden will lay a wreath at Aisne-Marne American Cemetery in Northern France, the same spot Trump refused to visit as president in 2018, claiming the weather wouldn't allow him to make the stop.\n\nBut it was later revealed Trump refused to make the visit because he feared his hair would become disheveled in the rain and because he did not believe it was important to honor the American war dead, calling them 'suckers' and 'losers.'\n\nBiden won't speak at the cemetery but the picture will be worth a thousand words.\n\nHe'll be more direct in his speech at Pointe du Hoc, which will be direct at Americans, according to the White House, and be a defense of 'freedom and democracy' - a message Biden has emphasized in his re-election campaign.\n\nBiden, in his remarks, will talk about how the battle was 'an existential fight between dictatorship and freedom,' how the men fighting that day 'put the country ahead of themselves' and about 'the dangers of isolationism,' Sullivan told reporters.\n\nHe added that Biden will 'be drawing a throughline from World War II through the Cold War and the stand up of the greatest military alliance the world has ever known, the NATO alliance, to today, where we face once again war in Europe, where NATO has rallied to defend freedom and sovereignty in Europe.'\n\nBiden will speak in the same spot where Reagan gave his famous The Boys of Pointe du Hoc speech on June 6, 1984 - the 40th anniversary of D-Day. President Biden's remarks ill come forty years and one day later.\n\n'These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc,' Reagan said in one of the most memorable speeches of his presidency.\n\n'These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war.'\n\nBiden also will try to replicate what happened next: Reagan returned to the United States to fight a bitter re-election campaign and win in a landslide.\n\n'Biden will probably try to hit those same notes that unify everybody,' James Melville, a former U.S. ambassador to Estonia who spent 34 years working for the State Department, told NBC News. 'I'm sure the political folks are looking at that [Reagan's speech] and thinking how do they steal some of that magic.'\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan gives his famous 'Boys of Pointe du Hoc' speech in Normandy on June 6th, 1984 - the 40th anniversary of D-Day\n\nA group of U.S. Army Rangers demonstrate how they climbed a rope ladder up the cliff face at Pointe du Hoc to surprise a Nazi gun position\n\nPresident Biden left Tuesday night for Paris, heading overseas son Hunter sits in Wilmington, Del., courtroom, fighting federal gun charges.\n\nTheir visit comes as Biden is pushing a major ceasefire proposal in the Middle East, which the French are supporting as the Israelis are casting doubt they will support.\n\nAnd it comes among shift geopolitical politics: the Ukraine still fighting off Russia, China increasing its economic and military and Brexit champion Nigel Farage throwing a wrench in UK politics with his decision to run for prime minister.\n\nBiden faces his own political battle with his 2020 rival as he and Trump vie for a second term in the White House.\n\nThe president's trip is essentially two parts: his visit to Normandy on Thursday and Firday along with a state visit to Paris on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nBiden, 81, was one-year old on D-Day.\n\nThe president will honor the 'service and the sacrifice of American troops in wars overseas,' White House spokesman John Kirby said in a briefing on Tuesday. 'Our commitment to honor that sacrifice should never waver.'\n\nAs part of their trip, the Bidens will meet with World War II veterans on Thursday in Normandy when they mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day, when allied forces launched the largest-ever land, sea and air armada that would result in Adolf Hitler's downfall 11 months later.\n\n'He looks forward to paying respects to all of them,' Kirby said.\n\nVeterans have already begun arriving in France. About 60 from America will attend.\n\nBiden will be joined by 25 heads of state and government, including French President Emmanuel Macron, King Charles, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\n102-year-old World War II veteran Gene Kleindl, from Rockford, Illinois, greets visitors at the Normandy American Cemetery; Kleindl, a medic in the U.S. Army, arrived on the beaches of Normandy on D-Day +2\n\nSergeant Ben Beale, with veterans Jack Mortimer, John Life, Corporal Aaron Stone, veteran Donald Jones, Corporal Paul Squires, and veteran Peter Newton, as the veterans return to Sword Beach in Normandy, France, after landing there on D-Day\n\nSix U.S. A-20 bombers fly about the beaches at Normandy in May 1944\n\nThe president will return to Normandy on Friday to speak about the importance of democracy, a topic he has emphasized repeatedly during his campaign for a second term in the White House.\n\n'He will take full advantage of the opportunity to talk about the moment we're living in the importance of democracies working together on behalf of peoples, but also the importance of American leadership,' Kirby said.\n\nBiden repeatedly has called his Trump, his Republican rival, a 'threat to democracy.'\n\nThe president spoke about his France trip when he appealed to donors at a closed-door fundraiser in Greenwich, Conn., on Monday night.\n\n'Democracy is literally on the ballot this year,' he said.\n\nAnd he repeated his previous criticism of Trump for calling soldiers 'losers and suckers.'\n\n'Losers and suckers! Who in the hell does he think he is?' he said in a raised voice.\n\nAnd he noted of Trump: 'This guy does not deserve to be president whether or not I'm running.'\n\nBiden was referring to the Trump's visit to France in November 2018 and how he skipped a visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, blaming the rainy, foggy weather.\n\nBut the Atlantic, citing multiple sources, revealed Trump said: 'Why should I go to that cemetery? It's filled with losers' and referred to the more than 1,800 marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood as 'suckers' for getting killed.\n\nThe former president has contested the account, saying the Secret Service refused to let him make the stop due to the bad weather. There was fog and heavy rain over the cemetery, and the White House, at the time, said there was not time to organize French security to cover a long motorcade route. Trump had been scheduled to fly there on Marine One.\n\nLater, Trump's then-chief of staff, John Kelly, has gone on the record to say those were Trump's words. Kelly is a retired U.S. Marine Corps general who lost his son in Afghanistan.\n\nBiden has railed against Trump repeatedly about the incident and contrasts it to the service of his late-son Beau Biden. Beau served in the Iraq as part of the Delaware National Guard. He died in 2015 of brain cancer, which the president attributes to Beau being stationed near burn pits.\n\nThe cemetery holds the remains of American forces, who, in World War I, helped other allied troops stop the German advance toward Paris in the spring of 1918.\n\nThe American flag flies at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery dedicated to the U.S. soldiers killed in the Belleau Wood battle during World War One\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron welcomes then-President Donald Trump to France on November 10, 2018\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, walk through a World War II cemetery near Omaha Beach on the 40th anniversary of the D-Day in June 1984\n\nBut, in his remarks, Biden will be looking to court the same voters who helped propel Reagan to the White House, blue-collar working class whites.\n\nThey make up part of what his re-election campaign calls the 'blue wall' - the older, whiter states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nBiden and Trump are running competitively in the three Midwest states - both campaigns need to win them in order to win the White House.\n\nAfter his speech to Americans on Friday, June 7th, Biden will return to Paris for the state visit.\n\nOn Saturday, he'll have a traditional state visit with French President Emmanuel Macron, who Biden hosted for his first state dinner in December 2022.\n\nThe official visit will begin with an arrival ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe, which will include a wreath laying, troop review and a parade procession of thousands of troops (some on horseback) down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9e.\n\nHe and Macron will meet at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace and later in the evening the first couple will attend a formal, black-tie state dinner.\n\nIn their talks, two Presidents will discuss their ongoing support for Ukraine, as well as ways to strengthen bi-lateral cooperation on economic, space and nuclear issues, the French said.\n\nMacron and his wife Brigitte went on a state visit to the U.S. in Dec. 2022.\n\nBiden will return to the United States on Sunday. Next week, he'll turn around and return to Europe on Thursday, where he will attend a G7 meeting in Italy.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"},

It's filled with losers.\"\n\nAn angry Biden has repeatedly brought up those comments in election campaign speeches -- not least because his own son Beau had served in the military and he blamed his son's death of brain cancer at age 46 in 2015 on toxins from army burn pits in Iraq.\n\n- 'Defending freedom' -\n\nBiden will also take part in the international ceremony marking the D-Day landings on June 6, 1944, on Omaha Beach in Normandy.\n\nLater in the week he will meet French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris for a visit featuring a welcome ceremony, military parade and working dinner, followed by a joint press conference.\n\nIt will finish with a grand state dinner, with Macron returning the compliment after Biden treated him to the same honor in Washington in December 2022.\n\nThe White House said the two leaders would make an announcement on cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, where China is increasingly assertive, as well as on the energy transition and nuclear energy.\n\nBut on Friday Biden has carved out time for a speech whose real audience is at home in the United States.\n\nBiden will speak about \"the importance of defending freedom and democracy\" at Pointe du Hoc, a promontory overlooking Omaha Beach taken by US Rangers in one of the fiercest battles on D-Day.\n\nForty years ago President Ronald Reagan used the same location to proclaim that democracy was worth dying for \"because it's the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised by man.\"\n\nThe Republican also took aim at the then Soviet Union in that speech. In 2024 his words echo Biden's determination to support Ukraine against Russia's invasion.\n\nBut Biden's words will also clearly be aimed at Trump.\n\nBiden has repeatedly called his rival a threat to democracy over Trump's refusal to accept the 2020 election results, his support for the January 6, 2021 Capitol rioters, and his repeated hints at unrest if he loses a second election.\n\n\"Something snapped in this guy\" after 2020, Biden told a fundraiser earlier this week, in which he also branded Trump a \"convicted felon\" after the Republican was found guilty in his criminal hush money trial.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings",

He warned that if the allies failed there, \"Ukraine will be subjugated and it will not end there. Ukraine's neighbors will be threatened, all of Europe will be threatened.\n\n\"To surrender to bullies, to bow down to dictators, is simply unthinkable. Were we to do that, it means we would be forgetting what happened here on these hallowed beaches. Make no mistake: we will not bow down, we will not forget,\" he added.\n\nBiden's speech capped an emotional ceremony, where leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron, paid tribute to the veterans who stormed the beaches of Normandy 80 years ago.\n\nBefore his speech, Biden spoke with the veterans. One stood up out of his wheelchair and saluted him, saying: \"Mr. President.\" Another, who was struggling to get back into his chair, jokingly warned: \"Don't get old!\"\n\nTrump contrast\n\nThe trip has given Biden the opportunity to draw an implicit contrast with Trump, his general election rival, who is vying to return to the White House.\n\nOn Friday, he'll deliver a speech on democracy and freedom at Pointe du Hoc, echoing the famous election-year address by former President Ronald Reagan four decades earlier. By raising topics like the value of American allies and the need to combat tyrants, Biden can deliver a veiled critique of Trump's leadership style and penchant for isolationism rather than explicitly campaign on foreign soil.\n\n\"You don't have to be partisan to make your case for a free-world strategy and the alliance with Europe,\" said Daniel Fried, a former U.S. diplomat now at the Atlantic Council. \"And the contrast with Trump, you don't have to put into a partisan context.\"\n\nThen Biden will visit the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, the subject of a bombshell report about Trump during the last presidential election.\n\nThe Atlantic reported that Trump in 2018 canceled a visit to the graveyard - which serves as a final resting place for U.S. troops killed in World War I - because he was concerned about the impact of heavy rain on his hair, and that he belittled Americans who died in the nation's wars as \"suckers\" and \"losers.\"\n\nBiden has frequently seized on the reporting to criticize Trump, who blamed logistical problems caused by the weather for the scheduling change and has denied disparaging U.S. troops.\n\nBut even as Biden has declared his intention to revitalize alliances, his actions outside of Ukraine have strained some of those relationships. Steadfast support for Israel's war against Hamas has isolated him from European leaders more willing to condemn the military campaign that killed thousands of Palestinian civilians.\n\nThe White House's attempts to counter China and boost domestic manufacturing also come at the expense of European auto, technology, and green energy industries, causing friction with Macron.\n\nThat's left U.S. partners struggling to navigate the politics and economics of a post-pandemic world. And with ascendant developing nations more skeptical of the West, the liberal order established after World War II appears at its most vulnerable point in decades.\n\nMacron and the Biden administration have been at odds at times over their approach to Putin. French organizers of the D-Day ceremonies initially said Russian officials would be invited to recognize the Soviet Union's sacrifices fighting the Nazis. But last week, blowback led the French to reverse course.\n\nStill, the White House is eager to use the president's trip through France, the longest visit to a single country of his presidency, to evoke the past in hopes of rallying the world - and American voters.\n\nLeaders including Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz are attending ceremonies to mark the allied invasion of Normandy.\n\nIn an op-ed published in regional French newspaper Ouest-France, Scholz said his presence shows how Europe is now united and underscores the endurance of the transatlantic partnership.\n\n\"My participation today also bears witness to the deep Franco-German bond that has continued to grow in the decades since the end of the war: enemies have become partners and ultimately friends, closest friends,\" he said, adding: \"All of this should and can give us courage in the face of the return of war and imperialism to Europe through Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine.\"\n\nThe winning alliance helped form the backbone of the post-World War II global order through institutions like NATO.\n\nFresh U.S. aid for Ukraine was held up by Republicans in the U.S. Congress for months, which many Europeans took as a warning sign about what might happen if Trump wins.\n\nThe expression \"politics stops at the water's edge\" was once a guidepost for U.S. presidents traveling overseas, but not in this deeply polarized moment. With polls showing Biden struggling to gain traction - and European capitals rattled by the prospect of a second Trump term - the president is leaning into making the case that he is a bulwark of democracy.\n\n\"The world will be watching. More importantly, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, will be watching,\" pollster Frank Luntz said Monday on Bloomberg Television's Balance of Power.\n\nBiden's visit is poised to set the tone for how he tackles Trump and Putin ahead of Election Day. He departed Washington less than a week after Trump became the first former president convicted of a felony, injecting fresh turmoil into the election.\n\nBiden began referring to Trump openly as a \"convicted felon\" Monday, signaling a new aggressiveness toward his opponent.\n\nBut Biden faces his own challenges, with his son Hunter on trial, accused of lying about drug abuse on a federal firearm document. And the president has not been immune to charges of insensitivity toward the nation's war dead. He was photographed looking at his watch during a 2021 dignified transfer of troops killed during the evacuation from Afghanistan.\n\n--------\n\n(With assistance from Skylar Woodhouse, Joe Mathieu,

So he's going to be speaking in in terms of principles and values and lessons from history that are applicable today,' Sullivan said.\n\nHe arrived in France on Wednesday, wearing his signature aviator sunglasses as he disembarked from Air Force One. He will spend the day in Paris, meeting with staff.\n\nHe heads to Normandy on Thursday where he will meet with Zelensky there and again on the sidelines of the G7 in Italy next week.\n\nThe meeting comes after Biden approved Ukraine using American-provided weapons in Russia as President Vladimir Putin has stepped up his campaign there.\n\nPresident Biden was welcomed by France's Prime Minister Gabriel Attal\n\nPresident Joe Biden left for France on Tuesday; Jill Biden is traveling separately\n\nTo further make his point about the threats to freedom, Biden will lay a wreath at Aisne-Marne American Cemetery in Northern France, the same spot Trump refused to visit as president in 2018, claiming the weather wouldn't allow him to make the stop.\n\nRead More King Charles and Queen Camilla hear poignant tales of courage from D-Day veterans: Heroes share memories and treasured keepsakes during visit to Buckingham Palace for 80th anniversary commemorations\n\nBut it was later revealed Trump refused to make the visit because he feared his hair would become disheveled in the rain and because he did not believe it was important to honor the American war dead, calling them 'suckers' and 'losers.'\n\nBiden won't speak at the cemetery but the picture will be worth a thousand words.\n\nHe'll be more direct in his speech at Pointe du Hoc, which will be direct at Americans, according to the White House, and be a defense of 'freedom and democracy' - a message Biden has emphasized in his re-election campaign.\n\nBiden, in his remarks, will talk about how the battle was 'an existential fight between dictatorship and freedom,' how the men fighting that day 'put the country ahead of themselves' and about 'the dangers of isolationism,' Sullivan told reporters.\n\nHe added that Biden will 'be drawing a throughline from World War II through the Cold War and the stand up of the greatest military alliance the world has ever known, the NATO alliance, to today, where we face once again war in Europe, where NATO has rallied to defend freedom and sovereignty in Europe.'\n\nBiden will speak in the same spot where Reagan gave his famous The Boys of Pointe du Hoc speech on June 6, 1984 - the 40th anniversary of D-Day. President Biden's remarks ill come forty years and one day later.\n\n'These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc,' Reagan said in one of the most memorable speeches of his presidency.\n\n'These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war.'\n\nBiden also will try to replicate what happened next: Reagan returned to the United States to fight a bitter re-election campaign and win in a landslide.\n\n'Biden will probably try to hit those same notes that unify everybody,' James Melville, a former U.S. ambassador to Estonia who spent 34 years working for the State Department, told NBC News. 'I'm sure the political folks are looking at that [Reagan's speech] and thinking how do they steal some of that magic.'\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan gives his famous 'Boys of Pointe du Hoc' speech in Normandy on June 6th, 1984 - the 40th anniversary of D-Day\n\nA group of U.S. Army Rangers demonstrate how they climbed a rope ladder up the cliff face at Pointe du Hoc to surprise a Nazi gun position\n\nPresident Biden left Tuesday night for Paris, heading overseas son Hunter sits in Wilmington, Del., courtroom, fighting federal gun charges.\n\nTheir visit comes as Biden is pushing a major ceasefire proposal in the Middle East, which the French are supporting as the Israelis are casting doubt they will support.\n\nAnd it comes among shift geopolitical politics: the Ukraine still fighting off Russia, China increasing its economic and military and Brexit champion Nigel Farage throwing a wrench in UK politics with his decision to run for prime minister.\n\nBiden faces his own political battle with his 2020 rival as he and Trump vie for a second term in the White House.\n\nThe president's trip is essentially two parts: his visit to Normandy on Thursday and Firday along with a state visit to Paris on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nBiden, 81, was one-year old on D-Day.\n\nThe president will honor the 'service and the sacrifice of American troops in wars overseas,' White House spokesman John Kirby said in a briefing on Tuesday. 'Our commitment to honor that sacrifice should never waver.'\n\nAs part of their trip, the Bidens will meet with World War II veterans on Thursday in Normandy when they mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day, when allied forces launched the largest-ever land, sea and air armada that would result in Adolf Hitler's downfall 11 months later.\n\n'He looks forward to paying respects to all of them,' Kirby said.\n\nVeterans have already begun arriving in France. About 60 from America will attend.\n\nBiden will be joined by 25 heads of state and government, including French President Emmanuel Macron, King Charles, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\n102-year-old World War II veteran Gene Kleindl, from Rockford, Illinois, greets visitors at the Normandy American Cemetery; Kleindl, a medic in the U.S. Army, arrived on the beaches of Normandy on D-Day +2\n\nSergeant Ben Beale, with veterans Jack Mortimer, John Life, Corporal Aaron Stone, veteran Donald Jones, Corporal Paul Squires, and veteran Peter Newton, as the veterans return to Sword Beach in Normandy, France, after landing there on D-Day\n\nSix U.S. A-20 bombers fly about the beaches at Normandy in May 1944\n\nThe president will return to Normandy on Friday to speak about the importance of democracy, a topic he has emphasized repeatedly during his campaign for a second term in the White House.\n\n'He will take full advantage of the opportunity to talk about the moment we're living in the importance of democracies working together on behalf of peoples, but also the importance of American leadership,' Kirby said.\n\nBiden repeatedly has called his Trump, his Republican rival, a 'threat to democracy.'\n\nThe president spoke about his France trip when he appealed to donors at a closed-door fundraiser in Greenwich, Conn., on Monday night.\n\n'Democracy is literally on the ballot this year,' he said.\n\nAnd he repeated his previous criticism of Trump for calling soldiers 'losers and suckers.'\n\n'Losers and suckers! Who in the hell does he think he is?' he said in a raised voice.\n\nAnd he noted of Trump: 'This guy does not deserve to be president whether or not I'm running.'\n\nBiden was referring to the Trump's visit to France in November 2018 and how he skipped a visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, blaming the rainy, foggy weather.\n\nBut the Atlantic, citing multiple sources, revealed Trump said: 'Why should I go to that cemetery? It's filled with losers' and referred to the more than 1,800 marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood as 'suckers' for getting killed.\n\nThe former president has contested the account, saying the Secret Service refused to let him make the stop due to the bad weather. There was fog and heavy rain over the cemetery, and the White House, at the time, said there was not time to organize French security to cover a long motorcade route. Trump had been scheduled to fly there on Marine One.\n\nLater, Trump's then-chief of staff, John Kelly, has gone on the record to say those were Trump's words. Kelly is a retired U.S. Marine Corps general who lost his son in Afghanistan.\n\nBiden has railed against Trump repeatedly about the incident and contrasts it to the service of his late-son Beau Biden. Beau served in the Iraq as part of the Delaware National Guard. He died in 2015 of brain cancer, which the president attributes to Beau being stationed near burn pits.\n\nThe cemetery holds the remains of American forces, who, in World War I, helped other allied troops stop the German advance toward Paris in the spring of 1918.\n\nThe American flag flies at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery dedicated to the U.S. soldiers killed in the Belleau Wood battle during World War One\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron welcomes then-President Donald Trump to France on November 10, 2018\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, walk through a World War II cemetery near Omaha Beach on the 40th anniversary of the D-Day in June 1984\n\nBut, in his remarks, Biden will be looking to court the same voters who helped propel Reagan to the White House, blue-collar working class whites.\n\nThey make up part of what his re-election campaign calls the 'blue wall' - the older, whiter states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nBiden and Trump are running competitively in the three Midwest states - both campaigns need to win them in order to win the White House.\n\nAfter his speech to Americans on Friday, June 7th, Biden will return to Paris for the state visit.\n\nOn Saturday, he'll have a traditional state visit with French President Emmanuel Macron, who Biden hosted for his first state dinner in December 2022.\n\nThe official visit will begin with an arrival ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe, which will include a wreath laying, troop review and a parade procession of thousands of troops (some on horseback) down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9e.\n\nHe and Macron will meet at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace and later in the evening the first couple will attend a formal, black-tie state dinner.\n\nIn their talks, two Presidents will discuss their ongoing support for Ukraine, as well as ways to strengthen bi-lateral cooperation on economic, space and nuclear issues, the French said.\n\nMacron and his wife Brigitte went on a state visit to the U.S. in Dec. 2022.\n\nBiden will return to the United States on Sunday. Next week, he'll turn around and return to Europe on Thursday, where he will attend a G7 meeting in Italy.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

It's filled with losers.\"\n\nAn angry Biden has repeatedly brought up those comments in election campaign speeches -- not least because his own son Beau had served in the military and he blamed his son's death of brain cancer at age 46 in 2015 on toxins from army burn pits in Iraq.\n\n- 'Defending freedom' - More from this section Hamilton Palestinian man happy to have parents in Canada but worries for sister's family in Gaza 'Change your Ticketmaster password.' Data breach concerns Connecticut customers Israel denies Netanyahu to address US Congress over Jewish holiday\n\nBiden will also take part in the international ceremony marking the D-Day landings on June 6, 1944, on Omaha Beach in Normandy.\n\nLater in the week he will meet French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris for a visit featuring a welcome ceremony, military parade and working dinner, followed by a joint press conference.\n\nIt will finish with a grand state dinner, with Macron returning the compliment after Biden treated him to the same honor in Washington in December 2022.\n\nThe White House said the two leaders would make an announcement on cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, where China is increasingly assertive, as well as on the energy transition and nuclear energy.\n\nBut on Friday Biden has carved out time for a speech whose real audience is at home in the United States.\n\nBiden will speak about \"the importance of defending freedom and democracy\" at Pointe du Hoc, a promontory overlooking Omaha Beach taken by US Rangers in one of the fiercest battles on D-Day.\n\nForty years ago President Ronald Reagan used the same location to proclaim that democracy was worth dying for \"because it's the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised by man.\"\n\nThe Republican also took aim at the then Soviet Union in that speech. In 2024 his words echo Biden's determination to support Ukraine against Russia's invasion.\n\nBut Biden's words will also clearly be aimed at Trump.\n\nBiden has repeatedly called his rival a threat to democracy over Trump's refusal to accept the 2020 election results, his support for the January 6, 2021 Capitol rioters, and his repeated hints at unrest if he loses a second election.\n\n\"Something snapped in this guy\" after 2020, Biden told a fundraiser earlier this week, in which he also branded Trump a \"convicted felon\" after the Republican was found guilty in his criminal hush money trial.\n\naue-dk/bfm", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aurelia_end@reformer.com", "name": "Aurelia

These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war,\" Reagan said during the 40th anniversary of D-Day, while in the midst of a reelection campaign against Walter Mondale.\n\nWhile the trip marks a departure from the campaign trail for President Biden, he has criticized his 2024 opponent, former president Donald Trump, over a 2020 report that Trump referred to service members buried at Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, a World War I cemetery, as \"losers\" and \"suckers.\" While Trump has denied the report, a former chief of staff confirmed elements of the original report in The Atlantic to CNN years later.\n\n\"Who the hell does he think he is? Who does he think he is? These were heroes. These soldiers were heroes, just as every American who has served this nation. Believing otherwise, that alone is disqualifying for someone to seek this office,\" President Biden said last month during a campaign event in Scranton, Pennsylvania.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, NATO has expanded in the face of Russia's aggression, while under the Trump administration, Trump raised questions over the United States' commitment to NATO, a treaty organization formed following World War II to provide security against the Soviet Union.\n\n\"That war showed the world the value of strong alliances and partnerships, which is the lesson that continues to resonate today in Europe and well beyond. This visit will come at an important moment, as Ukraine continues to face down Russian threats in its east and north and as we are working to address the humanitarian crisis in the Middle East,\" Kirby said.\n\nThe visit culminates with French President Emmanuel Macron hosting President Biden and first lady Jill Biden for a state visit.\n\n\"The State Visit will reflect the enduring and comprehensive relationship between the United States and France, our oldest ally, founded on shared democratic values, economic ties, and defense and security cooperation,\" the White House previewed in a statement by press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.\n\nThe bilateral meeting between leaders is expected to bring deliverables that deepen coordination in the Indo-Pacific, increase clean energy -- including increasing nuclear capacity -- and foster cooperation surrounding the Olympics, according to Kirby.\n\nThe trip marks the start of significant international engagement for President Biden, who will then attend the G7 summit in Italy next week.\n\nIsrael at War\n\nBiden urges action Gaza cease-fire agreement: 'Can't lose this moment' Haley Bull & Jacob Gardenswartz 11:09 AM, May 31,

He'll look to link the historic backdrop to Ukraine's current struggle to reverse Russia's invasion.\n\nLater, Biden is staging two events drawing implicit contrasts with Trump, who is vying to return to the White House.\n\nOn Friday, he'll deliver a speech on democracy and freedom at Pointe du Hoc, echoing the famous election-year address by former President Ronald Reagan four decades earlier. By raising topics like the value of American allies and the need to combat tyrants, Biden can deliver a veiled critique of Trump's leadership style and penchant for isolationism rather than explicitly campaign on foreign soil.\n\n\"You don't have to be partisan to make your case for a free-world strategy and the alliance with Europe. And the contrast with Trump, you don't have to put into a partisan context,\" said Daniel Fried, a former US diplomat now at the Atlantic Council.\n\nThen Biden will visit the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, the subject of a bombshell report about Trump during the last presidential election.\n\nThe Atlantic reported that Trump in 2018 canceled a visit to the graveyard - which serves as a final resting place for US troops killed in World War I - because he was concerned about the impact of heavy rain on his hair, and that he belittled Americans who died in the nation's wars as \"suckers\" and \"losers.\"\n\nBiden has frequently seized on the reporting to criticize Trump, who blamed logistical problems caused by the weather for the scheduling change and has denied disparaging US troops.\n\nBiden offered a preview of his remarks Monday, tying the struggle against fascism during World War II to the US election.\n\n\"Democracy is literally on the ballot this year,\" Biden told donors at a fundraiser in Connecticut. \"The future of democracy and freedom is at stake. We have brave soldiers who gave their lives on the beaches of Normandy who did their part.\"\n\nBut even as Biden has declared his intention to revitalize alliances, his actions outside of Ukraine have strained some of those relationships. Steadfast support for Israel's war against Hamas has isolated him from European leaders more willing to condemn the military campaign that killed thousands of Palestinian civilians.\n\nThe White House's attempts to counter China and boost domestic manufacturing also come at the expense of European auto, technology, and green energy industries, causing friction with Biden's host, French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThat's left US partners struggling to navigate the politics and economics of a post-pandemic world. And with ascendant developing nations more skeptical of the West, the liberal order established after World War II appears at its most vulnerable point in decades.\n\n\"Disagreements with allies and partners is not something new to President Biden, any more than unity and cooperation and collaboration, which he also fosters,\" White House spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday.\n\nMacron and the Biden administration have been at odds at times over their approach to Putin. French organizers of the D-Day ceremonies initially said Russian officials would be invited to recognize the Soviet Union's sacrifices fighting the Nazis. But last week, blowback from the US and other participants led the French to reverse course.\n\nStill, the White House is eager to use the president's trip through France, the longest visit to a single country of his presidency, to evoke the past in hopes of rallying the world -- and American voters.\n\nLeaders including Macron, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz are expected to attend Thursday's ceremonies along with veterans to mark the allied invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944, which paved the way for victory over Nazi Germany.\n\nThe winning alliance helped form the backbone of the post-World War II global order through institutions like NATO, which Trump has repeatedly questioned. Those same organizations have been crucial for backing Kyiv's war effort.\n\nFresh US aid for Ukraine was held up by Republicans in the US Congress for months, which many Europeans took as a warning sign about what might happen if Trump wins. Biden is expected to discuss the issue this week during a state visit with Macron.\n\n\"He'll talk about the dangers of isolationism and how, if we bow to dictators, fail to stand up to them, they keep going and ultimately America and the world pays a greater price,\" White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Tuesday.\n\nThe expression \"politics stops at the water's edge\" was once a guidepost for US presidents traveling overseas, but not in this deeply polarized moment. With polls showing Biden struggling to gain traction -- and European capitals rattled by the prospect of a second Trump term -- the president is leaning into making the case that he is a bulwark of democracy.\n\n\"The world will be watching. More importantly, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, will be watching,\" pollster Frank Luntz said Monday on Bloomberg Television's Balance of Power.\n\nBiden's visit is poised to set the tone for how he tackles Trump and Putin ahead of Election Day. He departed Washington less than a week after Trump became the first former president convicted of a felony, injecting fresh turmoil into the election.\n\nBiden began referring to Trump openly as a \"convicted felon\" Monday, signaling a new aggressiveness toward his opponent. Biden and allies had previously tread lightly, for fear of legitimizing Trump's claims of political prosecution.\n\nBut Biden faces his own challenges, with his son Hunter on trial, accused of lying about drug abuse on a federal firearm document. And the president has not been immune to charges of insensitivity toward the nation's war dead. He was photographed looking at his watch during a 2021 dignified transfer of troops killed during the evacuation from Afghanistan.\n\n--With assistance from Skylar Woodhouse, Joe Mathieu, Kailey Leinz

He started with the image of President Franklin Roosevelt in early 1941, months before the attack on Pearl Harbor that would draw the United States into World War II.\n\n\"President Roosevelt's purpose was to wake up Congress and alert the American people that this was no ordinary time,\" said Biden, delivering his remarks in the same House chamber where Roosevelt had spoken. \"Freedom and democracy were under assault in the world.\"\n\nThe United States was still on the sidelines in the war at that point. But Hitler was on the march in Europe, and American allies were under attack. Like then, Biden argued, this is no ordinary time.\n\n\"What makes our moment rare is that freedom and democracy are under attack both at home and overseas at the very same time,\" said Biden.\n\nExpect Biden to expand on those themes in an address to the American people he's set to deliver from Pointe du Hoc, overlooking the beaches where the Americans landed on June 6, 1944. More than 70,000 American troops joined allied forces for the dangerous and daring D-Day operation. Casualties were heavy, with 2,500 Americans killed on D-Day itself and some 29,000 more in the Battle of Normandy that followed.\n\nWhile Biden's address isn't a campaign speech, the undercurrent will be unavoidable. Biden has framed his reelection campaign against former President Donald Trump in stark terms, as he did at a fundraiser in New York earlier this week.\n\n\"What those soldiers died for should never be given up,\" said Biden. \"Democracy is literally on the ballot this year.\"\n\nAsked whether this speech about democracy and freedom was aimed at Trump, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said it would focus on universal themes. \"Principles that have served as the foundation of American security and American democracy for generations, including the generation that scaled those cliffs, including today's generation, including the next generation,\" Sullivan told reporters traveling with Biden on Air Force One. \"He's going to be speaking in terms of principles and values and lessons from history that are applicable today.\"\n\nBiden, who describes Trump as an existential threat to America's place as a global leader, takes pride in marshalling U.S. allies to support Ukraine after Russia's invasion, and expanding NATO to include two new members.\n\nWhile at the international commemoration of D-Day on Thursday, Biden is scheduled to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the leaders will discuss the state of play in the war with Russia, Sullivan said. Biden recently authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied weapons to strike inside Russia, an escalation as the war grinds into its third year.\n\nRepublicans in the Trump wing of the Republican party have questioned the utility of ongoing U.S. support for Ukraine. And Trump himself has repeatedly toyed with the idea of the U.S. not keeping its commitment to the NATO alliance.\n\nDuring a campaign rally in February, Trump said America would not defend allies that did not spend enough money on their own defense, should Russia attack them. \"In fact. I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want,\" Trump said.\n\nThe NATO alliance and its commitment to mutual defense grew out of the experience of World War II. And polling from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs finds the majority of Americans still support that alliance.\n\n\"We have understood for so long now since D-Day really, that our security, our prosperity and our freedom depends on the security, prosperity and freedom of our allies around the world,\" said Ivo Daalder, who heads the Chicago Council and was the U.S. ambassador to NATO during the Obama administration.\n\nBut Daalder says isolationist views are growing. \"NATO is becoming politicized in a way it never was until this point.\" said Daalder.\n\nThere's a massive gulf between Trump's message today and the one then-President Ronald Reagan delivered 40 years ago at a D-Day ceremony in Normandy.\n\n\"We in America have learned bitter lessons from two World Wars. It is better to be here ready to protect the peace than to take blind shelter across the sea, rushing to respond only after freedom is lost,\" Reagan said then. \"We've learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments with expansionist intent.\"\n\nA lot has changed since 1984. The Berlin Wall fell. The Cold War ended. The Soviet Union dissolved, only for Russian President Vladimir Putin to decades later attempt to rebuild it.\n\nThere are echoes of that Reagan speech in the way Biden describes Putin and his war in Ukraine. But many people aren't buying that argument.\n\n\"You could feel the loss of understanding at the end of the Cold War of what our allies were for,\" said Heather Conley, director of the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\nConley is in the midst of a tour of the country, trying to make the case for continued U.S. military aid to Ukraine. And she's getting an earful.\n\n\"The American people have some important questions to ask about what's important about our security, our level of debt,\" said Conley. \"These are the right questions to ask.

The brazen air and sea invasion would mark the beginning of the end of World War II, leading to the defeat of Adolf Hitler's Nazi German forces in Europe less than a year later.\n\nMr. Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were together to mark the most significant victory of the Western allies in the war, as well as the largest seaborne invasion in history. Mr. Biden is in France through the weekend for D-Day anniversary commemorations and plans to meet with leaders of key allies during his visit.\n\n\"What the allies did here 80 years ago, far surpassed anything we could have done on our own,\" Mr. Biden said in remarks Thursday. \"Together, we won the war.\"\n\n\"The men who fought here became heroes -- given an audacious mission, knowing the probability of dying was real,\" he said. \"But they did it anyway, knowing without a doubt there are things worth fighting and dying for. Freedom, worth it. Democracy worth it. America worth it. Then, now and always.\"\n\nMr. Biden and first lady Jill Biden met WWII veterans one by one ahead of a memorial ceremony at the Normandy American Cemetery on Thursday, presenting each one with coins made to commemorate the D-Day anniversary. He chatted and joked with some of the men, asking about their hometowns, thanking them for their service and calling them the greatest generation ever.\n\nThe president delivered remarks Thursday at a commemoration ceremony that was also attended by members of Congress from both parties, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and speaker emerita Nancy Pelosi.\n\n\"On behalf of the American people and its Commander in Chief, it's the highest honor to be able to salute you here in Normandy. All of you. God love you,\" Mr. Biden said, addressing the WWII veterans in the audience.\n\nThe U.S. president quoted Britain's WWII commander Winston Churchill, saying he \"called what happened here the greatest, most complicated operation ever,\" and adding that the entire world waited to see the outcome of the \"great crusade to free Europe from tyranny.\"\n\nSpeaking about the tens of thousands of American men who poured onto Normandy's beaches that day, charging into a hail of gun and mortar fire, Mr. Biden said \"it was estimated that 80% of them would be killed within hours. That was the estimate. But they were brave. They were resolute,\" and they got the job done.\n\nThe president then pivoted to Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine, warning that \"tyrants\" of today were watching closely for cracks in the transatlantic NATO defense alliance that grew out of the WWII Allied forces. He said democracy was \"more at risk now than at any point since World War II.\"\n\nDescribing Russia's invasion of Ukraine as the actions of a \"tyrant intent on domination,\" Mr. Biden vowed that the U.S. and its European partners \"will not bow down.\"\n\n\"We cannot surrender to the bullies, it is simply unthinkable. If we do, freedom will be subjugated, all Europe will be threatened,\" he said.\n\nThe June 6, 1944 D-Day operation, given the codename OVERLORD, sent five naval assault divisions to the beaches of Normandy, France. The invasion included 7,000 ships and landing craft operate by more than 195,000 naval personnel. More than 130,000 troops from the U.S., Great Britain and their allies landed on the shores. Many more followed, and their efforts helped lead to the defeat of German Nazi forces.\n\nMr. Biden planned to give a speech on Friday at Normandy's Point du Hoc cliffs that would highlight the men who scaled those cliffs 80 years ago, democracy and the \"dangers of isolationism,\" said national security adviser Jake Sullivan. In his speech, the president will draw a line from World War II to the formation of NATO to today, as war again haunts Europe, Sullivan said.\n\nOn Saturday, the festivities will continue as Mr. Biden participates in a parade procession to the Elysee Palace. And on Sunday, the president will lay a wreath at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, where World War I veterans are buried.\n\nAmong the allies Mr. Biden will meet with in France is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as Ukraine continues to suffer from Russia's onslaught.\n\nThe president is expected to have an \"extended discussion\" with Macron on a range of issues, including the Middle East, Ukraine, the Indo-Pacific, technology and clean energy, Sullivan said. Macron and Mr. Biden are scheduled to make a joint press appearance on Saturday, and Macron is hosting a state dinner for the president and first lady on Saturday.\n\nIn 2018, then-President Donald Trump opted out of the trip to Normandy to commemorate the anniversary of D-Day while in Paris, citing bad weather, a move that drew intense criticism.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType":

He warned that if the allies failed there, \"Ukraine will be subjugated and it will not end there. Ukraine's neighbors will be threatened, all of Europe will be threatened.\n\n\"To surrender to bullies, to bow down to dictators, is simply unthinkable. Were we to do that, it means we would be forgetting what happened here on these hallowed beaches. Make no mistake: we will not bow down, we will not forget,\" he added.\n\nBiden's speech capped an emotional ceremony, where leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron, paid tribute to the veterans who stormed the beaches of Normandy 80 years ago.\n\nBefore his speech, Biden spoke with the veterans. One stood up out of his wheelchair and saluted him, saying: \"Mr. President.\" Another, who was struggling to get back into his chair, jokingly warned: \"Don't get old!\"\n\nTrump Contrast\n\nThe trip has given Biden the opportunity to draw an implicit contrast with Trump, his general election rival, who is vying to return to the White House.\n\nOn Friday, he'll deliver a speech on democracy and freedom at Pointe du Hoc, echoing the famous election-year address by former President Ronald Reagan four decades earlier. By raising topics like the value of American allies and the need to combat tyrants, Biden can deliver a veiled critique of Trump's leadership style and penchant for isolationism rather than explicitly campaign on foreign soil.\n\n\"You don't have to be partisan to make your case for a free-world strategy and the alliance with Europe,\" said Daniel Fried, a former US diplomat now at the Atlantic Council. \"And the contrast with Trump, you don't have to put into a partisan context.\"\n\nThen Biden will visit the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, the subject of a bombshell report about Trump during the last presidential election.\n\nThe Atlantic reported that Trump in 2018 canceled a visit to the graveyard - which serves as a final resting place for US troops killed in World War I - because he was concerned about the impact of heavy rain on his hair, and that he belittled Americans who died in the nation's wars as \"suckers\" and \"losers.\"\n\nBiden has frequently seized on the reporting to criticize Trump, who blamed logistical problems caused by the weather for the scheduling change and has denied disparaging US troops.\n\nBut even as Biden has declared his intention to revitalize alliances, his actions outside of Ukraine have strained some of those relationships. Steadfast support for Israel's war against Hamas has isolated him from European leaders more willing to condemn the military campaign that killed thousands of Palestinian civilians.\n\nThe White House's attempts to counter China and boost domestic manufacturing also come at the expense of European auto, technology, and green energy industries, causing friction with Macron.\n\nThat's left US partners struggling to navigate the politics and economics of a post-pandemic world. And with ascendant developing nations more skeptical of the West, the liberal order established after World War II appears at its most vulnerable point in decades.\n\nMacron and the Biden administration have been at odds at times over their approach to Putin. French organizers of the D-Day ceremonies initially said Russian officials would be invited to recognize the Soviet Union's sacrifices fighting the Nazis. But last week, blowback led the French to reverse course.\n\nStill, the White House is eager to use the president's trip through France, the longest visit to a single country of his presidency, to evoke the past in hopes of rallying the world -- and American voters.\n\nLeaders including Macron, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz are attending ceremonies to mark the allied invasion of Normandy.\n\nIn an op-ed published in regional French newspaper Ouest-France, Scholz said his presence shows how Europe is now united and underscores the endurance of the transatlantic partnership.\n\n\"My participation today also bears witness to the deep Franco-German bond that has continued to grow in the decades since the end of the war: enemies have become partners and ultimately friends, closest friends,\" he said, adding: \"All of this should and can give us courage in the face of the return of war and imperialism to Europe through Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine.\"\n\nThe winning alliance helped form the backbone of the post-World War II global order through institutions like NATO.\n\nFresh US aid for Ukraine was held up by Republicans in the US Congress for months, which many Europeans took as a warning sign about what might happen if Trump wins.\n\nThe expression \"politics stops at the water's edge\" was once a guidepost for US presidents traveling overseas, but not in this deeply polarized moment. With polls showing Biden struggling to gain traction -- and European capitals rattled by the prospect of a second Trump term -- the president is leaning into making the case that he is a bulwark of democracy.\n\n\"The world will be watching. More importantly, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, will be watching,\" pollster Frank Luntz said Monday on Bloomberg Television's Balance of Power.\n\nBiden's visit is poised to set the tone for how he tackles Trump and Putin ahead of Election Day. He departed Washington less than a week after Trump became the first former president convicted of a felony, injecting fresh turmoil into the election.\n\nBiden began referring to Trump openly as a \"convicted felon\" Monday, signaling a new aggressiveness toward his opponent.\n\nBut Biden faces his own challenges, with his son Hunter on trial, accused of lying about drug abuse on a federal firearm document. And the president has not been immune to charges of insensitivity toward the nation's war dead. He was photographed looking at his watch during a 2021 dignified transfer of troops killed during the evacuation from Afghanistan.\n\n--With assistance from Skylar Woodhouse, Joe Mathieu, Kailey

The brazen air and sea invasion would mark the beginning of the end of World War II, leading to the defeat of Adolf Hitler's Nazi German forces in Europe less than a year later.\n\nMr. Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were together to mark the most significant victory of the Western allies in the war, as well as the largest seaborne invasion in history. Mr. Biden is in France through the weekend for D-Day anniversary commemorations and plans to meet with leaders of key allies during his visit.\n\n\"Seventy-three-thousand brave Americans landed at Utah and Omaha beaches in Normandy on June 6, 1944 and the president will greet American veterans and their family members while in France to honor their sacrifice,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in announcing the president's trip.\n\nMr. Biden and first lady Jill Biden met WWII veterans one by one ahead of a memorial ceremony at the Normandy American Cemetery on Thursday, presenting each one with coins made to commemorate the D-Day anniversary. He chatted and joked with some of the men, asking about their hometowns, thanking them for their service and calling them the greatest generation ever.\n\nThe president delivered remarks later Thursday at a commemoration ceremony that was also attended by members of Congress from both parties, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and speaker emerita Nancy Pelosi.\n\n\"On behalf of the American people and its Commander in Chief, it's the highest honor to be able to salute you here in Normandy. All of you. God love you,\" Mr. Biden said, addressing the WWII veterans in the audience.\n\nThe U.S. president quoted Britain's WWII commander Winston Churchill, saying he \"called what happened here the greatest, most complicated operation ever,\" and adding that the entire world waited to see the outcome of the \"great crusade to free Europe from tyranny.\"\n\nSpeaking about the tens of thousands of American men who poured onto Normandy's beaches that day, charging into a hail of gun and mortar fire, Mr. Biden said \"it was estimated that 80% of them would be killed within hours. That was the estimate. But they were brave. They were resolute,\" and they got the job done.\n\n\"What the allies did here 80 years ago, far surpassed anything we could have done on our own,\" Mr. Biden said. \"Together we won the war.\"\n\n\"The men who fought here became heroes -- given an audacious mission, knowing the probability of dying was real,\" he said. \"But they did it anyway, knowing without a doubt there are things worth fighting and dying for. Freedom, worth it. Democracy worth it. America worth it. Then, now and always.\"\n\nThe president then pivoted to Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine, warning that \"tyrants\" of today were watching closely for cracks in the transatlantic NATO defense alliance that grew out of the WWII Allied forces. He said democracy was \"more at risk now than at any point since World War II.\"\n\nDescribing Russia's invasion of Ukraine as the actions of a \"tyrant intent on domination,\" Mr. Biden vowed that the U.S. and its European partners \"will not bow down.\"\n\n\"We cannot surrender to the bullies, it is simply unthinkable. If we do, freedom will be subjugated, all Europe will be threatened,\" he said.\n\nThe June 6, 1944 D-Day operation, given the codename OVERLORD, sent five naval assault divisions to the beaches of Normandy, France. The invasion included 7,000 ships and landing craft operate by more than 195,000 naval personnel. More than 130,000 troops from the U.S., Great Britain and their allies landed on the shores. Many more followed, and their efforts helped lead to the defeat of German Nazi forces.\n\nMr. Biden planned to give a speech on Friday at Normandy's Point du Hoc cliffs that would highlight the men who scaled those cliffs 80 years ago, democracy and the \"dangers of isolationism,\" said national security adviser Jake Sullivan. In his speech, the president will draw a line from World War II to the formation of NATO to today, as war again haunts Europe, Sullivan said.\n\nOn Saturday, the festivities will continue as Mr. Biden participates in a parade procession to the Elysee Palace. And on Sunday, the president will lay a wreath at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, where World War I veterans are buried.\n\nAmong the allies Mr. Biden will meet with in France is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as Ukraine continues to suffer from Russia's onslaught.\n\nThe president is expected to have an \"extended discussion\" with Macron on a range of issues, including the Middle East, Ukraine, the Indo-Pacific, technology and clean energy, Sullivan said. Macron and Mr. Biden are scheduled to make a joint press appearance on Saturday, and Macron is hosting a state dinner for the president and first lady on Saturday.\n\nIn 2018, then-President Donald Trump opted out of the trip to Normandy to commemorate the anniversary of D-Day while in Paris, citing bad weather, a move that drew intense criticism.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType":

He chatted and joked with some of the men, asking about their hometowns, thanking them for their service and calling them the greatest generation ever.\n\nThe president was expected to deliver remarks later Thursday at a commemoration ceremony that was also being attended by members of Congress from both parties including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and speaker emerita Nancy Pelosi.\n\nBefore Mr. Biden's remarks, French President Emmanuel Macron and then U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin addressed the gathered dignitaries, lauding the service of the WWII veterans.\n\nThe June 6, 1944 D-Day operation, given the codename OVERLORD, sent five naval assault divisions to the beaches of Normandy, France. The invasion included 7,000 ships and landing craft operate by more than 195,000 naval personnel. More than 130,000 troops from the U.S., Great Britain and their allies landed on the shores. Many more followed, and their efforts helped lead to the defeat of German Nazi forces.\n\nMr. Biden planned to give a speech on Friday at Normandy's Point du Hoc cliffs that would highlight the men who scaled those cliffs 80 years ago, democracy and the \"dangers of isolationism,\" said national security adviser Jake Sullivan. In his speech, the president will draw a line from World War II to the formation of NATO to today, as war again haunts Europe, Sullivan said.\n\nOn Saturday, the festivities will continue as Mr. Biden participates in a parade procession to the Elysee Palace. And on Sunday, the president will lay a wreath at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, where World War I veterans are buried.\n\nAmong the allies Mr. Biden will meet with in France is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as Ukraine continues to suffer from Russia's onslaught.\n\nThe president is expected to have an \"extended discussion\" with Macron on a range of issues, including the Middle East, Ukraine, the Indo-Pacific, technology and clean energy, Sullivan said. Macron and Mr. Biden are scheduled to make a joint press appearance on Saturday, and Macron is hosting a state dinner for the president and first lady on Saturday.\n\nIn 2018, then-President Donald

On Thursday, he will join more than twenty heads of state and government in Normandy, as well as dozens of World War II veterans, some more than a century old. They will honor the troops from the United States, Canada and Great Britain who landed in France on June 6, 1944, in an offensive that laid the foundation for the defeat of the Nazis.\n\nBiden is also expected to deliver a speech on democracy and freedom on Friday, according to the White House, giving him an opportunity to put the fight against authoritarianism in a global framework. A day later, he will meet with President Emmanuel Macron for his first state visit to France as president of the United States.\n\nThe theme of this week's ceremonies, a brotherhood of nations united in sacrifice to defeat authoritarianism, factors into this week's European Parliament elections, as well as Biden's message in his campaign against Trump. The Biden campaign argues that the former president, who baselessly denies his 2020 defeat, is a self-styled authoritarian who would end American democracy if he prevails.\n\nThe contrast with Trump will likely remain largely unspoken, but it will be hard to ignore. Biden has regularly cited reports that the former president, during a visit to France while occupying the White House, was reluctant to honor U.S. service members buried in a French cemetery and allegedly treated fallen soldiers as suckers and losers.\n\nTrump has forcefully denied making the remarks. But Biden brought up those reports again at a fundraiser in Connecticut on Monday.\n\nLosers and assholes! Who the hell does he think he is? he said, his voice getting louder. This guy doesn't deserve to be president, whether I run or not.\n\nDuring his presidency, Biden has emphasized the task of rebuilding alliances damaged by Trump and working to restore America's role as a global leader, rejecting Trump's America First agenda and decrying him as a figure whose his peers scoffed.\n\nBiden also criticized Trump for saying he would encourage Russia to do whatever it wanted to NATO members if those countries didn't spend their share on defense. And he warned that Trump would give more freedom to authoritarian leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, who invaded Ukraine more than two years ago.\n\nBut when Biden arrived in France, he was at odds with other Western leaders over some of his own foreign policy positions, particularly the U.S. role in the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nBiden and Macron will discuss the need for unwavering, long-term support for Ukraine, according to the French government, but it comes as global support for a war approaching its three-year mark has waned, including in the United States. United.\n\nBiden has also faced political criticism at home and abroad for his unwavering support for Israel's invasion of Gaza, as the death toll there surpassed 36,000, according to Gaza's health ministry. Israel launched its military campaign in the Palestinian enclave after Hamas militants arrived in Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostage, according to Israeli officials.\n\nEven so, Biden's trip is likely to be compared to Trump's trips to France during his presidential term.\n\nFive years ago, Trump visited Normandy for the 75th anniversary of the landings, giving a speech honoring the soldiers who gave their lives at the historic site. Macron and other leaders used their remarks to praise international institutions like NATO and the European Union, but Trump did not spend much time praising alliances born out of World War II, s 'sticking instead to America First themes.\n\nTrump was also criticized for using a Fox News interview, recorded while he was at the Normandy American Cemetery, to denounce his political enemies despite the solemn setting. With the white cross-shaped headstones of fallen service members in the background, Trump called former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III a fool and attacked then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) Room, like a disaster.\n\nBiden doesn't need to mention Trump by name to provide a stark contrast to his predecessors' disastrous appearances on the world stage, said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian.\n\nSimply talking about how these men died trying to destroy authoritarianism will lead to the inference that Trump blew his visit, Brinkley said. But [Biden] must remain above the political fray. It would be deeply inappropriate to directly attack Trump while you are on the hallowed grounds of the cemetery.\n\nTrump also visited Paris in 2018, a trip that became controversial after he chose not to make a planned stop at a cemetery where U.S. service members were buried. A report in the Atlantic said Trump had privately disparaged the servicemen buried there, an account that was later confirmed by his then-chief of staff, although others on the trip said that bad weather was to blame for Trump's decision.\n\nRegardless, one of Biden's final stops in France will be to lay a wreath at the World War I Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, the site Trump ignored.\n\nBiden will probably be more warmly received in France than Trump. The former president was unpopular with the French, while Biden, who invited Macron to Washington in 2022 for the first state visit of his administration, is generally well-liked here. Most visiting American presidents are greeted enthusiastically on war anniversaries in France, a country where the memory of the United States' role in ending World War II is still very much alive.\n\nBiden's strong support for Ukraine also earned him support from France, said Renaud Girard, an international columnist at French newspaper Le Figaro. Biden will be well received because the majority of the French population, while not anti-Russian, found Russian aggression in 2022 unacceptable, he said.\n\nHowever, Biden may face a more controversial issue: the war in Gaza. Biden's strong support for Israel is at odds with the opinion of a part of French society, which believes that Israel went too far in its retaliation after October 7, Girard said.\n\nDemonstrations against the war take place regularly throughout France. The latest, in Paris on Saturday, attracted 22,000 people, according to the police. Some activist groups have planned protests this week, although they are not explicitly related to Biden's visit.\n\nStill, Girard said, the French public understood that Biden did everything possible to secure a ceasefire, including his recent announcement of a plan to bring a lasting end to the war. In France, Biden is not equated with Netanyahu, Girard said.\n\nDelivering an emotional speech on the beach at Normandy has become something of a tradition for U.S. presidents, who have used the setting to praise America's military and the world order they helped create. The Normandy landings were the largest joint naval, air, and land assault ever, and despite numerous casualties, the successful operation helped make the U.S. military the premier fighting force in the world.\n\nIn 1984, President Ronald Reagan delivered a resounding speech at Pointe du Hoc, considered one of his most memorable.\n\nThey're the boys from Pointe du Hoc, Reagan said. These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped liberate a continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war.\n\nBiden, who like Reagan at the time has struggled with low approval ratings on foreign policy and is seeking re-election, also plans to deliver a speech at Pointe du Hoc. Reagan then won reelection in a landslide, something Biden no doubt hopes to replicate, said Brinkley, whose book The Boys of Pointe du Hoc examined Reagan's speech and the U.S. troops who fought in it.\n\nThis is Biden's opportunity to show his deep understanding of the cost of war, he said.\n\nOlorunnipa reported from Washington.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes

It's filled with losers.\"\n\nAn angry Biden has repeatedly brought up those comments in election campaign speeches -- not least because his own son Beau had served in the military and he blamed his son's death of brain cancer at age 46 in 2015 on toxins from army burn pits in Iraq.\n\n- 'Defending freedom' -\n\nBiden will also take part in the international ceremony marking the D-Day landings on June 6, 1944, on Omaha Beach in Normandy.\n\nLater in the week he will meet French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris for a visit featuring a welcome ceremony, military parade and working dinner, followed by a joint press conference.\n\nIt will finish with a grand state dinner, with Macron returning the compliment after Biden treated him to the same honor in Washington in December 2022.\n\nThe White House said the two leaders would make an announcement on cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, where China is increasingly assertive, as well as on the energy transition and nuclear energy.\n\nBut on Friday Biden has carved out time for a speech whose real audience is at home in the United States.\n\nBiden will speak about \"the importance of defending freedom and democracy\" at Pointe du Hoc, a promontory overlooking Omaha Beach taken by US Rangers in one of the fiercest battles on D-Day.\n\nForty years ago President Ronald Reagan used the same location to proclaim that democracy was worth dying for \"because it's the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised by man.\"\n\nThe Republican also took aim at the then Soviet Union in that speech. In 2024 his words echo Biden's determination to support Ukraine against Russia's invasion.\n\nBut Biden's words will also clearly be aimed at Trump.\n\nBiden has repeatedly called his rival a threat to democracy over Trump's refusal to accept the 2020 election results, his support for the January 6, 2021 Capitol rioters, and his repeated hints at unrest if he loses a second election.\n\n\"Something snapped in this guy\" after 2020, Biden told a fundraiser earlier this week, in which he also branded Trump a \"convicted felon\" after the Republican was found guilty in his criminal hush money trial.\n\naue-dk/bfm\n\nMore from this section\n\nScientology Volunteer Ministers Honored for Their Help in the Aftermath of Last Year's Devastating Floods\n\nClick n' Close to

President Biden is kicked off a day of remembrance, evoking the memory of allies united against tyranny.\n\nIt was 80 years ago on June 6, that Allied forces stormed the beaches of Normandy.\n\nThe invasion led to the defeat of the Nazis 11 months later. Thursday morning, veterans gathered for what could be one of their last trips back to France.\n\nRelated Story: Oklahoma Man Visits France To Commemorate 80th Anniversary Of D-Day Landings\n\nMr. Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were together to mark the most significant victory of the Western allies in the war, as well as the largest seaborne invasion in history. Mr. Biden is in France through the weekend for D-Day anniversary commemorations and plans to meet with leaders of key allies during his visit. France did not invite Russia, a World War II ally, because of its war against Ukraine.\n\n\"What the allies did here 80 years ago, far surpassed anything we could have done on our own,\" Mr. Biden said in remarks Thursday. \"Together, we won the war.\"\n\n\"The men who fought here became heroes -- given an audacious mission, knowing the probability of dying was real,\" he said. \"But they did it anyway, knowing without a doubt there are things worth fighting and dying for. Freedom, worth it. Democracy, worth it. America, worth it. Then, now, and always.\"\n\nMr. Biden and first lady Jill Biden met WWII veterans one by one ahead of a memorial ceremony at the Normandy American Cemetery on Thursday, presenting each one with coins made to commemorate the D-Day anniversary. He chatted and joked with some of the men, asking about their hometowns, thanking them for their service and calling them the greatest generation ever.\n\nThe president delivered remarks Thursday at a commemoration ceremony that was also attended by members of Congress from both parties, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and speaker emerita Nancy Pelosi.\n\n\"On behalf of the American people and its Commander in Chief, it's the highest honor to be able to salute you here in Normandy. All of you. God love you,\" Mr. Biden said, addressing the WWII veterans in the audience.\n\nThe U.S. president quoted Britain's WWII leader Winston Churchill, saying he \"called what happened here the greatest, most complicated operation ever,\" and adding that the entire world waited to see the outcome of the \"great crusade to free Europe from tyranny.\"\n\nSpeaking about the tens of thousands of American men who poured onto Normandy's beaches that day, charging into a hail of gun and mortar fire, Mr. Biden said \"it was estimated that 80% of them would be killed within hours. That was the estimate. But they were brave. They were resolute,\" and they got the job done.\n\n\"The men who fought here became heroes, not because they were the strongest our toughest or fiercest, although they were, but because they were given an audacious mission, knowing, every one of them knew, the probability of dying was real,\" Mr. Biden said. \"But they did it anyway. They knew, beyond any doubt, there are things that are worth fighting and dying for. Freedom is worth it. Democracy is worth it. America is worth it. The world is worth it. Then, now, and always.\"\n\nThe president then pivoted to Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine, warning that \"tyrants\" of today were watching closely for cracks in the transatlantic NATO defense alliance that grew out of the WWII Allied forces. He said democracy was \"more at risk now than at any point since World War II.\"\n\nDescribing Russia's invasion of Ukraine as the actions of a \"tyrant intent on domination,\" Mr. Biden vowed that the U.S. and its European partners \"will not bow down.\"\n\n\"We cannot surrender to the bullies, it is simply unthinkable. If we do, freedom will be subjugated, all Europe will be threatened,\" he said.\n\nThe president and first lady also laid a wreath at the cemetery to remember the fallen soldiers.\n\nThe June 6, 1944, D-Day operation, given the codename OVERLORD, sent five naval assault divisions to the beaches of Normandy, France. The invasion included 7,000 ships and landing craft operated by more than 195,000 naval personnel. More than 130,000 troops from the U.S., Great Britain, and their allies landed on the shores. Many more followed, and their efforts helped lead to the defeat of German Nazi forces.\n\nMr. Biden planned to give a speech on Friday at Normandy's Point du Hoc cliffs that would highlight the men who scaled those cliffs 80 years ago, democracy, and the \"dangers of isolationism,\" said national security adviser Jake Sullivan. In his speech, the president will draw a line from World War II to the formation of NATO to today, as war again haunts Europe, Sullivan said.\n\nOn Saturday, the festivities will continue as Mr. Biden participates in a parade procession to the Elysee Palace. And on Sunday, the president will lay a wreath at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, where World War I veterans are buried.\n\nAmong the allies Mr. Biden will meet with in France is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as Ukraine continues to suffer from Russia's onslaught.\n\nThe president is expected to have an \"extended discussion\" with Macron on a range of issues, including the Middle East, Ukraine, the Indo-Pacific, technology, and clean energy, Sullivan said. Macron and Mr. Biden are scheduled to make a joint press appearance on Saturday, and Macron is hosting a state dinner for the president and first lady on Saturday.\n\nIn 2018, then-President Donald Trump opted out of the trip to Normandy to commemorate the anniversary of D-Day while in Paris, citing bad weather, a move that drew intense criticism.", "source": {"uri": "newson6.com", "dataType":

commitment to U.S. allies in Europe and contrast his vision of democracy with his 2024 political opponent Donald Trump.\n\nBiden will spend five days in France and attend D-Day celebrations in Normandy, where U.S. and allied forces stormed French beaches in an attack that helped defeat Nazi Germany in World War II, as well as deliver a high-profile speech and hold a formal state visit with President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nWhile in Normandy Biden will sit down for talks with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy about the war effort to repel Russian invaders, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters aboard the presidential flight to Paris.\n\nBiden's remarks in Normandy, both on Thursday at the formal 80th anniversary ceremony and on Friday at the famed Pointe du Hoc cliffs, will center around the dangers of isolationism and the need to stand up to dictators, Sullivan said.\n\nRead more:

It\u2019s filled with losers\u201d.\n\nAn angry Biden has repeatedly brought up those comments in election campaign speeches \u2013 not least because his own son Beau had served in the military and he blamed his son\u2019s death of brain cancer at age 46 in 2015 on toxins from army burn pits in Iraq.\n\nBiden will also take part in the international ceremony marking the D-Day landings on June 6, 1944, on Omaha Beach in Normandy.\n\nLater in the week he will meet French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris for a visit featuring a welcome ceremony, military parade and working dinner, followed by a joint press conference.\n\nIt will finish with a grand state dinner, with Macron returning the compliment after Biden treated him to the same honour in Washington in December 2022.\n\nThe White House said the two leaders would make an announcement on cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, where China is increasingly assertive, as well as on the energy transition and nuclear energy.\n\nBut on Friday Biden has carved out time for a speech whose real audience is at home in the United States.\n\nBiden will speak about \u201cthe importance of defending freedom and democracy\u201d at Pointe du Hoc, a promontory overlooking Omaha Beach taken by US Rangers in one of the fiercest battles on D-Day.\n\nForty years ago President Ronald Reagan used the same location to proclaim that democracy was worth dying for \u201cbecause it\u2019s the most deeply honourable form of government ever devised by man\u201d.\n\nThe Republican also took aim at the then Soviet Union in that speech. In 2024 his words echo Biden\u2019s determination to support Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\nBut Biden\u2019s words will also clearly be aimed at Trump.\n\nBiden has repeatedly called his rival a threat to democracy over Trump\u2019s refusal to accept the 2020 election results, his support for the January 6, 2021 Capitol rioters, and his repeated hints at unrest if he loses a second election.\n\n\u201cSomething snapped in this guy\u201d after 2020, Biden told a fundraiser earlier this week, in which he also branded Trump a \u201cconvicted felon\u201d after the Republican was

Wootson Jr.,Toluse Olorunnipa and Annabelle Timsit Washington Post\n\nPARIS - President Biden arrived in France on Wednesday to join world leaders in commemorating the 80th anniversary of D-Day, a visit in which he plans to evoke the memory of allies united against tyranny to highlight the stakes of his election campaign and draw a pointed comparison with Donald Trump.\n\nBiden, wearing his trademark aviators and a blue suit, was welcomed at Orly airport by French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal. On Thursday, he will join more than two dozen heads of state and government descending on Normandy, along with dozens of World War II veterans, some more than a century old. They will honor troops from the United States, Canada and Britain who landed in France on June 6, 1944, in an offensive that laid the groundwork for the defeat of the Nazis.\n\nBiden is also scheduled to deliver a speech on democracy and freedom on Friday, according to the White House, giving him an opportunity to put the struggle against authoritarianism in a global frame. A day later, he will meet President Emmanuel Macron for his first state visit to France as U.S. president.\n\nThe theme of this week's ceremonies - a brotherhood of nations united in sacrifice to beat back authoritarianism - is one that is factoring into European Parliament elections this week, as well as Biden's message in his campaign against Trump. The Biden campaign argues that the former president, who groundlessly denies his 2020 loss, is a would-be authoritarian who would end American democracy if he prevails.\n\nThe contrast with Trump is likely to remain largely unspoken, but it will be hard to miss. Biden has regularly cited reports that the former president, during a visit to France when he occupied the White House, was reluctant to honor American service people buried at a French cemetery and reportedly called fallen soldiers \"suckers\" and \"losers.\"\n\nTrump has forcefully denied making the remarks. But Biden again touched on the reports at a fundraiser in Connecticut on Monday.\n\n\"'Losers and suckers!' Who in the hell does he think he is?\" he said, his voice growing louder. \"This guy does not deserve to be president, whether or not I'm running.\"\n\nBiden during his presidency has highlighted the task of rebuilding alliances damaged by Trump and working to restore America's role as a world leader, rejecting Trump's \"America First\" agenda and decrying him as a figure who was laughed at by his peers.\n\nBiden has also criticized Trump for saying he would encourage Russia to do \"whatever the hell they want\" to NATO members if those countries are not spending their share on defense. And he has warned that Trump would give a freer hand to authoritarian leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, who invaded Ukraine more than two years ago.\n\nBut as Biden arrived in France, he was at odds with other Western leaders over some of his own foreign policy positions, especially the U.S. role in conflagrations in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nBiden and Macron will discuss \"the need for unwavering, long-term support for Ukraine,\" according to the French government, but that comes as global support for a war inching toward the three-year mark has waned, including in the United States.\n\nBiden has also taken political hits at home and abroad for his staunch support of Israel's invasion of Gaza, as the death toll there has climbed above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Israel launched its military campaign in the Palestinian enclave after Hamas militants surged into Israel on Oct. 7 and killed about 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostage, according to Israeli officials.\n\nThrough it all, Biden's trip is likely to draw comparisons to Trump's travels to France during his presidential term.\n\nFive years ago, Trump visited Normandy for the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings, giving a speech that honored the troops who gave their lives at the historic site. Macron and other leaders used their remarks to praise international institutions like NATO and the European Union, but Trump spent little time hailing the alliances that emerged from World War II, sticking instead to \"America First\" themes.\n\nTrump also drew criticism for using a Fox News interview, taped while he was at the Normandy American Cemetery, to rail against his political enemies despite the solemn setting. With the white, cross-shaped headstones of fallen service members in the background, Trump called former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III a \"fool\" and attacked then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) as \"a disaster.\"\n\nBiden does not need to cite Trump by name to provide a vivid contrast with his predecessor's \"disastrous\" appearances on the world stage, said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian.\n\n\"By simply talking about how these men died trying to destroy authoritarianism, it will be inferred that Trump bungled his visit,\" Brinkley said. \"But [Biden] has to stay above the political fray. It would be deeply inappropriate to take a direct swipe at Trump while you're on the sacred grounds of the cemetery.\"\n\nTrump also visited Paris in 2018, a trip that became controversial after he opted not to make a planned stop at a cemetery where U.S. service members were buried. A report in the Atlantic said Trump privately disparaged the service members buried there, an account that was later confirmed by his then-chief of staff, although others on the trip said bad weather was responsible for Trump's decision.\n\nRegardless, one of Biden's final stops in France will be to lay a wreath at the World War I-era Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, the site that Trump skipped.\n\nBiden is likely to receive a warmer welcome in France than Trump did. The former president was unpopular with the French, while Biden, who invited Macron to Washington in 2022 for his administration's first state visit, is generally well-liked here. Most visiting American presidents are greeted enthusiastically around wartime anniversaries in France, a country where the memory of the United States' role in helping to end World War II is still very much alive.\n\nBiden's strong backing of Ukraine has also earned him support in France, said Renaud Girard, an international columnist at the French newspaper Le Figaro. \"Biden will be well received because the majority of the French population, without being anti-Russian, found Russia's aggression in 2022 unacceptable,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Biden could come up against a more divisive issue: the war in Gaza. Biden's strong support for Israel is at odds with the views of a section of French society, which believes Israel \"has gone too far in its reprisals after Oct. 7,\" Girard said.\n\nAntiwar protests occur regularly across France. The most recent, in Paris on Saturday, attracted 22,000 people, according to police. Some activist groups have planned protests this week, though they are not explicitly tied to Biden's visit.\n\nStill, said Girard, \"the French public has understood that Biden has done everything possible to obtain a cease-fire,\" including his recent announcement of a plan for a \"durable end to the war.\" In France, \"Biden is not equated with Netanyahu,\" Girard said.\n\nGiving a moving speech on the beach at Normandy has become something of a tradition for American presidents, who have used the setting to praise U.S. service members and the global order they helped create. The Normandy landings were the largest joint naval, air and land assault ever carried out, and despite high casualties, the successful operation helped establish the U.S. military as the world's premier fighting force.\n\nIn 1984, President Ronald Reagan delivered a soaring speech at Pointe du Hoc that has been regarded as one of his most memorable.\n\n\"These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc,\" Reagan said. \"These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war.\"\n\nBiden, who like Reagan at the time has struggled with low approval ratings on foreign policy and is seeking reelection, plans to deliver remarks at Pointe du Hoc as well. Reagan went on to win reelection in a landslide, something Biden is no doubt hoping to replicate, said Brinkley, whose book \"The Boys of Pointe du Hoc\" examined Reagan's speech and the U.S. troops who fought there.\n\n\"This is Biden' s opportunity to showcase a soulful understanding of the cost of war,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The brazen air and sea invasion would mark the beginning of the end of World War II, leading to the defeat of Adolf Hitler's Nazi German forces in Europe less than a year later.\n\nMr. Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were together to mark the most significant victory of the Western allies in the war, as well as the largest seaborne invasion in history. Mr. Biden is in France through the weekend for D-Day anniversary commemorations, planning to meet with key allies during his visit.\n\n\"73,000 brave Americans landed at Utah and Omaha beaches in Normandy on June 6, 1944 and the president will greet American veterans and their family members while in France to honor their sacrifice,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in announcing the president's trip.\n\nMr. Biden and first lady Jill Biden met WWII veterans one by one ahead of a memorial ceremony at the Normandy American Cemetery on Thursday, presenting each one with coins made to commemorate the D-Day anniversary. He chatted and joked with some of the men, asking about their hometowns, thanking them for their service and calling them the greatest generation ever.\n\nThe president was expected to deliver remarks later Thursday at a commemoration ceremony, which was also being attended by members of Congress from both parties, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and speaker emerita Nancy Pelosi.\n\nThe June 6, 1944 D-Day operation, given the codename OVERLORD, sent five naval assault divisions to the beaches of Normandy, France. The invasion included 7,000 ships and landing craft run by more than 195,000 naval personnel. More than 130,000 troops from the U.S., Great Britain and their allies landed on the shores. Many more soldiers followed, and their efforts helped lead to the defeat of German Nazi forces.\n\nThe president planned to give a speech on Friday at Normandy's Point du Hoc cliffs that will highlight the men who scaled those cliffs 80 years ago, democracy and the \"dangers of isolationism,\" said national security adviser Jake Sullivan. In his speech, the president will draw a line from World War II to the formation of NATO to today, as war again haunts Europe, Sullivan said.\n\nOn Saturday, the festivities will continue as Mr. Biden participates in a parade procession to the Elysee Palace. And on Sunday, Mr. Biden will lay a wreath at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, where World War I veterans are buried.\n\nAmong the allies Mr. Biden will meet with in France is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as Ukraine continues to suffer from Russia's onslaught.\n\nThe president is expected to have an \"extended discussion\" with Macron on a range of issues, including the Middle East, Ukraine, the Indo-Pacific, technology and clean energy, Sullivan said. Macron and Mr. Biden are scheduled to make a joint press appearance on Saturday, and Macron is hosting a state dinner for the president and first lady Jill Biden on Saturday.\n\nIn 2018,

Mr. Biden is in France through the weekend for D-Day anniversary commemorations, planning to meet with key allies along the way.\n\n\"73,000 brave Americans landed at Utah and Omaha beaches in Normandy on June 6, 1944 and the president will greet American veterans and their family members while in France to honor their sacrifice,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in announcing the president's trip.\n\nMembers of Congress from both parties, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and speaker emerita Nancy Pelosi, will also be at the D-Day commemorations Thursday.\n\nThe June 6, 1944 D-Day operation, given the codename OVERLORD, sent five naval assault divisions to the beaches of Normandy, France. The invasion included 7,000 ships and landing craft run by more than 195,000 naval personnel. More than 130,000 troops from the U.S., Great Britain and their allies landed on the shores. Many more soldiers followed, and their efforts helped lead to the defeat of German Nazi forces.\n\nThe president plans to give a speech Friday from Normandy's Point du Hoc cliffs that will highlight the men who scaled those cliffs, democracy and the \"dangers of isolationism,\" said national security adviser Jake Sullivan. In his speech, the president will draw a line from World War II to the formation of NATO to today, as war again haunts Europe, Sullivan said.\n\nOn Saturday, the festivities will continue as Mr. Biden participates in a parade procession to the Elysee Palace. And on Sunday, Mr. Biden will lay a wreath at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, where World War I veterans are buried.\n\nAmong the allies Mr. Biden will meet with in France is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as Ukraine continues to suffer from Russia's onslaught.\n\nThe president is expected to have an \"extended discussion\" with Macron on a range of issues, including the Middle East, Ukraine, the Indo-Pacific, technology and clean energy, Sullivan said. Macron and Mr. Biden are scheduled to make a joint press appearance on Saturday, and Macron is hosting a state dinner for the president and first lady Jill Biden on Saturday.\n\nIn 2018, then-President Donald Trump opted out of the trip to Normandy to commemorate the anniversary of D-Day while in Paris, citing bad weather, a move that drew intense criticism.", "source": {"uri":

(Trump did not attend a ceremony there while he was in France in 2018.)\n\nReporter's notebook: A Black WWII hero is finally honored, 80 years after lifesaving D-Day courage\n\n\"The message is simple: that the service and the sacrifice of American troops in wars overseas should never be forgotten,\" Kirby said of Biden visiting the cemetery. \"And our commitment to honor that sacrifice should never waver, and our obligations to those they leave behind, even though it may be generations ago, can never be lessened.\"\n\nHe said Americans have a \"somber and sober\" obligation to acknowledge fallen soldiers because \"they didn't sacrifice their futures for nothing.\"\n\nOn Friday, Biden will deliver remarks on defending freedom and democracy at Pointe du Hoc, a 100-foot cliff Army Rangers scaled under gunfire to seize German artillery that could have been fired upon American forces landing on Omaha Beach down below.\n\n\"He'll talk about the stakes of that moment. An existential fight between dictatorship and freedom,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters. \"He'll talk about the men who scaled those cliffs and how they put themselves behind -- they put the country ahead of themselves.\n\n\"And he'll talk about the dangers of isolationism and how if we back [down?] to dictators, fail to stand up to them, they keep going and, ultimately, America and the world pays a greater price,\" Sullivan added.\n\nWomen veterans return to Normandy for 80th D-Day anniversary\n\nWhile Biden is in France, Kirby said Russia's war in Ukraine and Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza will be major points of discussion.\n\n\"This visit will come at an important moment as Ukraine continues to face down Russian threats in its east and north, and as we are working to address the humanitarian crisis in the Middle East,\" Kirby said.\n\nHe said that discussion will be had both in France and at the G7 Summit in Italy next week, on how the U.S. and its allies can pursue the \"worthwhile endeavor\" of using frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine, particularly with reconstruction.\n\nSullivan said Biden will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in both Normandy and on the sidelines of the G7 and will discuss \"how we can continue and deepen our support for Ukraine.\"\n\nVideo: Biden gives permission to Ukraine to strike inside Russian territory with US weapons\n\nHe said the two meetings will give Zelenskyy and Biden -- who will miss Ukraine's peace summit in Switzerland this month in favor of a glitzy fundraiser with former President Barack Obama, George Clooney and Julia Roberts -- the opportunity \"to go deep on every aspect and every issue in the war.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and Sullivan will represent the U.S. at the peace summit.\n\nBiden is also scheduled to go to Paris, where French President Emmanuel Macron will welcome him for a state visit, which will include a dinner and a meeting, during which they will discuss world issues, the White House said.\n\nAs part of the state visit, the two men will announce new steps they are taking to deepen Indo-Pacific cooperation, boost clean energy investments, increase nuclear energy capacity, and how the U.S. and France are working together to ensure the 2024 Paris Olympics are safe, Kirby said. He would not get into specifics.\n\nBiden says only Hamas stands in way of cease-fire, but questions about Israel remain\n\nDespite the U.S. and its allies walking in lockstep on many issues, including Ukraine, one issue where there has become some separation is the Israel-Hamas war, including with some nations unilaterally recognizing a Palestinian state, Kirby said.\n\n\"Many nations have different views, of course, about what's going on in Gaza,\" Kirby admitted, adding that Biden \"respects that, he appreciates that. It's the very idea of sovereignty, and territorial integrity and the precepts of the U.N. Charter that apply, and he respects all that. It doesn't mean we have to agree on everything.\"\n\n\"He doesn't make national security decisions based on popularity and he doesn't do it based on contrary opinions outside the United States,\" Kirby added.\n\nBut, overall, Kirby said Biden's engagements in France will highlight the importance of American leadership on the global stage.\n\n\"When he talks about American leadership, it's not an arrogant leadership,\" Kirby said. \"It's a humble leadership.\"\n\n\"He recognizes that, for as powerful as we are, as much good as we can do, we need help,\" Kirby said. \"Our allies and partners bring things to the endeavor that we can't always bring.\"\n\nKirby added: \"We send a much stronger signal about lofty words like peace and freedom and stability and security when we're working in concert with one another.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type":

The issue could hurt Biden in key states, including Michigan, in the November election.\n\nThe D-Day commemorations are set against a backdrop of a modern conflict in Europe, Russia's more than 2-year war with Ukraine.\n\nAt a political fundraiser before his trip, Biden called the D-Day invasion \"one of the most important moments in the history of defense of freedom and democracy in the history of the world\" and said the sacrifices from that day must not be given up.\n\n\"Democracy is literally on the ballot this year. The future of democracy and freedom is at stake.

He started with the image of President Franklin Roosevelt in early 1941, months before the attack on Pearl Harbor that would draw the United States into World War II.\n\n\"President Roosevelt's purpose was to wake up Congress and alert the American people that this was no ordinary time,\" said Biden, delivering his remarks in the same House chamber where Roosevelt had spoken. \"Freedom and democracy were under assault in the world.\"\n\nThe United States was still on the sidelines in the war at that point. But Hitler was on the march in Europe, and American allies were under attack. Like then, Biden argued, this is no ordinary time.\n\n\"What makes our moment rare is that freedom and democracy are under attack both at home and overseas at the very same time,\" said Biden.\n\nExpect Biden to expand on those themes in an address to the American people he's set to deliver from Pointe du Hoc, overlooking the beaches where the Americans landed on June 6, 1944. More than 70,000 American troops joined allied forces for the dangerous and daring D-Day operation. Casualties were heavy, with 2,500 Americans killed on D-Day itself and some 29,000 more in the Battle of Normandy that followed.\n\nWhile Biden's address isn't a campaign speech, the undercurrent will be unavoidable. Biden has framed his reelection campaign against former President Donald Trump in stark terms, as he did at a fundraiser in New York earlier this week.\n\n\"What those soldiers died for should never be given up,\" said Biden. \"Democracy is literally on the ballot this year.\"\n\nBiden, who describes Trump as an existential threat to America's place as a global leader, takes pride in marshalling U.S. allies to support Ukraine after Russia's invasion, and expanding NATO to include two new members.\n\nBut Republicans in the Trump wing of the Republican party question the utility of ongoing U.S. support for Ukraine. And Trump himself has repeatedly toyed with the idea of the U.S. not keeping its commitment to the NATO alliance.\n\nDuring a campaign rally in February, Trump said America would not defend allies that did not spend enough money on defense against a Russian attack. \"In fact. I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want,\" Trump said.\n\nThe NATO alliance and its commitment to mutual defense grew out of the experience of World War II. And polling from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs finds the majority of Americans still support that alliance.\n\n\"We have understood for so long now since D-Day really, that our security, our prosperity and our freedom depends on the security, prosperity and freedom of our allies around the world,\" said Ivo Daalder, who heads the Chicago Council and was the U.S. ambassador to NATO during the Obama administration.\n\nBut Daalder says isolationist views are growing. \"NATO is becoming politicized in a way it never was until this point.\" said Daalder.\n\nThere's a massive gulf between Trump's message today and the one then-President Ronald Reagan delivered 40 years ago at a D-Day ceremony in Normandy.\n\n\"We in America have learned bitter lessons from two World Wars. It is better to be here ready to protect the peace than to take blind shelter across the sea, rushing to respond only after freedom is lost,\" Reagan said then. \"We've learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments with expansionist intent.\"\n\nA lot has changed since 1984. The Berlin Wall fell. The Cold War ended. The Soviet Union dissolved, only for Russian President Vladimir Putin to decades later attempt to rebuild it.\n\nThere are echoes of that Reagan speech in the way Biden describes Putin and his war in Ukraine. But many people aren't buying that argument.\n\n\"You could feel the loss of understanding at the end of the Cold War of what our allies were for,\" said Heather Conley, director of the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\nConley is in the midst of a tour of the country, trying to make the case for continued U.S. military aid to Ukraine. And she's getting an earful.\n\n\"The American people have some important questions to ask about what's important about our security, our level of debt,\" said Conley. \"These are the right questions to ask. But you have to engage them in a conversation.\"\n\nConley, who was a senior official in former President George W. Bush's State Department, said she's glad Biden is giving the speech this week. But she said she wishes he had made this case more forcefully and more often.\n\n\"If it's important to the country, we have to have an important conversation with our citizens,\" said Conley.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

President Biden's remarks ill come forty years and one day later.\n\n'These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc,' Reagan said in one of the most memorable speeches of his presidency.\n\n'These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war.'\n\nBiden also will try to replicate what happened next: Reagan returned to the United States to fight a bitter re-election campaign and win in a landslide.\n\n'Biden will probably try to hit those same notes that unify everybody,' James Melville, a former U.S. ambassador to Estonia who spent 34 years working for the State Department, told NBC News. 'I'm sure the political folks are looking at that [Reagan's speech] and thinking how do they steal some of that magic.'\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan gives his famous 'Boys of Pointe du Hoc' speech in Normandy on June 6th, 1984 - the 40th anniversary of D-Day\n\nA group of U.S. Army Rangers demonstrate how they climbed a rope ladder up the cliff face at Pointe du Hoc to surprise a Nazi gun position\n\nAfter the assault at the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc by the 2nd Ranger Battalion (D, E and F Company) Colonel James E. Rudder establishes a Post Commando in June 1944\n\nPresident Biden left Tuesday night for Paris with first lady Jill Biden, heading overseas as their son Hunter sits in Wilmington, Del., courtroom, fighting federal gun charges.\n\nTheir visit comes as Biden is pushing a major ceasefire proposal in the Middle East, which the French are supporting as the Israelis are casting doubt they will support.\n\nAnd it comes among shift geopolitical politics: the Ukraine still fighting off Russia, China increasing its economic and military and Brexit champion Nigel Farage throwing a wrench in UK politics with his decision to run for prime minister.\n\nBiden faces his own political battle with his 2020 rival as he and Trump vie for a second term in the White House.\n\nThe president's trip is essentially two parts: his visit to Normandy on Thursday and Firday along with a state visit to Paris on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nBiden, 81, was one-year old on D-Day.\n\nThe president will honor the 'service and the sacrifice of American troops in wars overseas,' White House spokesman John Kirby said in a briefing on Tuesday. 'Our commitment to honor that sacrifice should never waver.'\n\nAs part of their trip, the Bidens will meet with World War II veterans on Thursday in Normandy when they mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day, when allied forces launched the largest-ever land, sea and air armada that would result in Adolf Hitler's downfall 11 months later.\n\n'He looks forward to paying respects to all of them,' Kirby said.\n\nVeterans have already begun arriving in France. About 60 from America will attend.\n\nBiden will be joined by 25 heads of state and government, including French President Emmanuel Macron, King Charles and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe White House would not say if Biden and Zelensky would meet but Kirby hinted at one, noting that 'it's not uncommon hen President Zelensky and President Biden are in the same city or town for whatever the purpose, then it's not uncommon for them to find time to meet.'\n\n102-year-old World War II veteran Gene Kleindl, from Rockford, Illinois, greets visitors at the Normandy American Cemetery; Kleindl, a medic in the U.S. Army, arrived on the beaches of Normandy on D-Day +2\n\nSergeant Ben Beale, with veterans Jack Mortimer, John Life, Corporal Aaron Stone, veteran Donald Jones, Corporal Paul Squires, and veteran Peter Newton, as the veterans return to Sword Beach in Normandy, France, after landing there on D-Day\n\nSix U.S. A-20 bombers fly about the beaches at Normandy in May 1944\n\nThe president will return to Normandy on Friday to speak about the importance of democracy, a topic he has emphasized repeatedly during his campaign for a second term in the White House.\n\n'He will take full advantage of the opportunity to talk about the moment we're living in the importance of democracies working together on behalf of peoples, but also the importance of American leadership,' Kirby said.\n\nBiden repeatedly has called his Trump, his Republican rival, a 'threat to democracy.'\n\nThe president spoke about his France trip when he appealed to donors at a closed-door fundraiser in Greenwich, Conn., on Monday night.\n\n'Democracy is literally on the ballot this year,' he said.\n\nAnd he repeated his previous criticism of Trump for calling soldiers 'losers and suckers.'\n\n'Losers and suckers! Who in the hell does he think he is?' he said in a raised voice.\n\nAnd he noted of Trump: 'This guy does not deserve to be president whether or not I'm running.'\n\nBiden was referring to the Trump's visit to France in November 2018 and how he skipped a visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, blaming the rainy, foggy weather.\n\nBut the Atlantic, citing multiple sources, revealed Trump said: 'Why should I go to that cemetery? It's filled with losers' and referred to the more than 1,800 marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood as 'suckers' for getting killed.\n\nThe former president has contested the account, saying the Secret Service refused to let him make the stop due to the bad weather. There was fog and heavy rain over the cemetery, and the White House, at the time, said there was not time to organize French security to cover a long motorcade route. Trump had been scheduled to fly there on Marine One.\n\nLater, Trump's then-chief of staff, John Kelly, has gone on the record to say those were Trump's words. Kelly is a retired U.S. Marine Corps general who lost his son in Afghanistan.\n\nBiden has railed against Trump repeatedly about the incident and contrasts it to the service of his late-son Beau Biden. Beau served in the Iraq as part of the Delaware National Guard. He died in 2015 of brain cancer, which the president attributes to Beau being stationed near burn pits.\n\nThe cemetery holds the remains of American forces, who, in World War I, helped other allied troops stop the German advance toward Paris in the spring of 1918.\n\nThe American flag flies at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery dedicated to the U.S. soldiers killed in the Belleau Wood battle during World War One\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron welcomes then-President Donald Trump to France on November 10, 2018\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, walk through a World War II cemetery near Omaha Beach on the 40th anniversary of the D-Day in June 1984\n\nBut, in his remarks, Biden will be looking to court the same voters who helped propel Reagan to the White House, blue-collar working class whites.\n\nThey make up part of what his re-election campaign calls the 'blue wall' - the older, whiter states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nBiden and Trump are running competitively in the three Midwest states - both campaigns need to win them in order to win the White House.\n\nAfter his speech to Americans on Friday, June 7th, Biden will return to Paris for the state visit.\n\nOn Saturday, he'll have a traditional state visit with French President Emmanuel Macron, who Biden hosted for his first state dinner in December 2022.\n\nThe official visit will begin with an arrival ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe, which will include a wreath laying, troop review and a parade procession of thousands of troops (some on horseback) down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9e.\n\nHe and Macron will meet at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace and later in the evening the first couple will attend a formal, black-tie state dinner.\n\nIn their talks, two Presidents will discuss their ongoing support for Ukraine, as well as ways to strengthen bi-lateral cooperation on economic, space and nuclear issues, the French said.\n\nMacron and his wife Brigitte went on a state visit to the U.S. in Dec. 2022.\n\nBiden will return to the United States on Sunday. Next week, he'll turn around and return to Europe on Thursday, where he will attend a G7 meeting in Italy.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

(Trump did not attend a ceremony there while he was in France in 2018.)\n\n\"The message is simple: that the service and the sacrifice of American troops in wars overseas should never be forgotten,\" Kirby said of Biden visiting the cemetery. \"And our commitment to honor that sacrifice should never waver, and our obligations to those they leave behind, even though it may be generations ago, can never be lessened.\"\n\nHe said Americans have a \"somber and sober\" obligation to acknowledge fallen soldiers because \"they didn't sacrifice their futures for nothing.\"\n\nOn Friday, Biden will deliver remarks on defending freedom and democracy at Pointe du Hoc, a 100-foot cliff Army Rangers scaled under gunfire to seize German artillery that could have been fired upon American forces landing on Omaha Beach down below.\n\n\"He'll talk about the stakes of that moment. An existential fight between dictatorship and freedom,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters. \"He'll talk about the men who scaled those cliffs and how they put themselves behind -- they put the country ahead of themselves.\n\n\"And he'll talk about the dangers of isolationism and how if we back [down?] to dictators, fail to stand up to them, they keep going and, ultimately, America and the world pays a greater price,\" Sullivan added.\n\nWhile Biden is in France, Kirby said Russia's war in Ukraine and Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza will be major points of discussion.\n\n\"This visit will come at an important moment as Ukraine continues to face down Russian threats in its east and north, and as we are working to address the humanitarian crisis in the Middle East,\" Kirby said.\n\nHe said that discussion will be had both in France and at the G7 Summit in Italy next week, on how the U.S. and its allies can pursue the \"worthwhile endeavor\" of using frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine, particularly with reconstruction.\n\nSullivan said Biden will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in both Normandy and on the sidelines of the G7 and will discuss \"how we can continue and deepen our support for Ukraine.\"\n\nHe said the two meetings will give Zelenskyy and Biden -- who will miss Ukraine's peace summit in Switzerland this month in favor of a glitzy fundraiser with former President Barack Obama, George Clooney and Julia Roberts -- the opportunity \"to go deep on every aspect and every issue in the war.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and Sullivan will represent the U.S. at the peace summit.\n\nBiden is also scheduled to go to Paris, where French President Emmanuel Macron will welcome him for a state visit, which will include a dinner and a meeting, during which they will discuss world issues, the White House said.\n\nAs part of the state visit, the two men will announce new steps they are taking to deepen Indo-Pacific cooperation, boost clean energy investments, increase nuclear energy capacity, and how the U.S. and France are working together to ensure the 2024 Paris Olympics are safe, Kirby said. He would not get into specifics.\n\nDespite the U.S. and its allies walking in lockstep on many issues, including Ukraine, one issue where there has become some separation is the Israel-Hamas war, including with some nations unilaterally recognizing a Palestinian state, Kirby said.\n\n\"Many nations have different views, of course, about what's going on in Gaza,\" Kirby admitted, adding that Biden \"respects that, he appreciates that. It's the very idea of sovereignty, and territorial integrity and the precepts of the U.N. Charter that apply, and he respects all that. It doesn't mean we have to agree on everything.\"\n\n\"He doesn't make national security decisions based on popularity and he doesn't do it based on contrary opinions outside the United States,\" Kirby added.\n\nBut, overall, Kirby said Biden's engagements in France will highlight the importance of American leadership on the global stage.\n\n\"When he talks about American leadership, it's not an arrogant leadership,\" Kirby said. \"It's a humble leadership.\"\n\n\"He recognizes that, for as powerful as we are, as much good as we can do, we need help,\" Kirby said. \"Our allies and partners bring things to the endeavor that we can't always bring.\"\n\nKirby added: \"We send a much stronger signal about lofty words like peace and freedom and stability and security when we're working in concert with one another.\"", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings",

It is unclear why he did that.\n\nBiden arrived in France early Wednesday morning time in America. Perhaps he needed a nap.\n\nThis isn't just a trip commemorating brave young service members who fought for freedom during WWII. That is all it should be. It is enough. But, no. Joe Biden will turn this trip into a campaign event. He is both desperate and shameless. That is a dangerous combination for a politician clinging to power, hoping to win re-election.\n\nJoe Biden promised to have the most transparent administration ever. That turned out to be a bogus promise. His is a very secretive administration and very unfriendly to the press. We can recognize that Trump was highly critical of the press but he spoke with them daily, if his schedule allowed. He stood and answered questions at every opportunity. That is not how Joe Biden governs in the White House. He avoids the press.\n\nWe've seen how Biden is approaching his re-election campaign. He holds very small events in battleground states. The press is kept as far back as possible. He usually does not take questions. Most of his events are held in Pennsylvania because it is near Delaware and an easy trip from Washington, D.C. Biden has to win Pennsylvania in November to win re-election.\n\nBiden frequently talks about former President Trump's trip to France to commemorate D-Day in 2018. He repeats the trope that Trump canceled a visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery where hundreds of U.S. Marines who died in the Battle of Belleau Wood during WWI are buried because he thought that the dead were losers.\n\nA story in the Atlantic later said that Trump canceled the visit, not because of rain and traffic congestion as was originally reported, but because he didn't want to get his hair messed up in the weather. There was also an alleged quote from an unnamed senior staffer who quoted Trump as saying, \"Why should I go to that cemetery? It's filled with losers.\" Trump and others have denied that story.\n\nNonetheless, Biden brings that story up at every opportunity. He likes to sound outraged by Trump's alleged statement because he personalizes the alleged story. Biden's son, Beau, died of brain cancer several years after serving as an officer in the Army Judge Advocate General's Corps in Iraq. Biden blames toxins from burn pits in Iraq as a contributing factor in Beau's cancer. Joe Biden often confuses Beau's story. Beau died in a hospital in America, not as he served in Iraq.\n\nIt is not clear if Joe Biden re-writes Beau's story because he has dementia and doesn't remember clearly when Beau died, or if it is just standard Biden lying. He is a serial liar and this may be just another whopper.\n\nBiden and his campaign hope to contrast Biden with Trump during this visit. The campaign will show Biden in the best possible light while he is in France. He will go to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery on Sunday. We'll see if he makes remarks during this visit.\n\nThere are other events planned, too.\n\nBiden will also take part in the international ceremony marking the D-Day landings on June 6, 1944, on Omaha Beach in Normandy.\n\nLater in the week, he will meet French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris for a visit featuring a welcome ceremony, military parade and working dinner, followed by a joint press conference.\n\nIt will finish with a grand state dinner, with Macron returning the compliment after Biden treated him to the same honor in Washington in December 2022.\n\nThe White House said the two leaders would make an announcement on cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, where China is increasingly assertive, as well as on the energy transition and nuclear energy.\n\nThe grand finale, though, is a speech scheduled on Friday about \"the importance of defending freedom and democracy\" at Pointe du Hoc, a promontory that overlooks Omaha Beach, the site taken by U.S. Rangers on D-Day. Biden's intended audience is American voters back home.\n\nBiden will likely note that President Reagan used the same location to declare that democracy was worth dying for \"because it's the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised by man.\" Reagan blasted the Soviet Union in that speech. Look for Biden to declare his support for Ukraine.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that Biden will use his speech on Friday to talk about the threat to democracy another term for Trump will present. This is a key Democrat talking point in the election. They have little else to run on so they have to scare voters.\n\nThe irony is that Team Biden is doing what they accuse Trump of wanting to do - destroy democracy, aka, America as we know it. Biden has introduced lawfare into the presidential campaign to keep Trump out of the White House. That can never be forgiven. Biden and his fellow travelers are the true threat to our way of life.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "karen_townsend@hotair.com",

But even if he doesn't mention his predecessor by name, the timing of his visit and the possibility of a change in administration after the US election make the contrasts undeniable.\n\nThat contrast will be underscored by the official theme of the D-Day commemoration, one of nations unifying against the renewed, rising threat of authoritarianism. It's a theme that dovetails closely with the main thrust of Biden's 2024 White House bid, which has portrayed Trump as an authoritarian threat and the US election as just one front in a larger war between democracy and autocracy.\n\nBiden's campaign has also argued that Trump, a convicted felon who has threatened to jail his political opponents in retaliation for his prosecution on nearly 100 charges across four jurisdictions, is a singular threat who could end America's nearly 250-year existence as a democracy if given another four years in the White House.\n\nThe president's trip to Normandy will highlight stark contrasts with a similar visit made by Trump in 2020, during which he refused to visit a cemetery where American marines were buried after falling in battle during the First World War. At the time, he described the honored dead as \"suckers and losers\" in remarks which have been widely reported and confirmed by his second White House chief of staff, retired US Marine general John Kelly.\n\nBiden, the father of a combat veteran who will visit the cemetery where Trump refused to tread on Friday, has repeatedly referenced his predecessor's disdain for America's fallen, including during remarks at a fundraiser earlier this week when he angrily said Trump \"does not deserve to be president, whether or not I'm running\".\n\nHe's also drawn contrasts with Trump on the subject of Nato, the transatlantic defense pact baptized in blood on the Normandy shores eight decades ago. While Biden has led efforts to bring two new members -- Finland and Sweden -- into Nato as a result of Russia's ongoing invasion against Ukraine, Trump has repeatedly threatened to pull America out of the alliance, which he routinely describes incorrectly as a protection racket or a country club with allied nations paying \"dues\" in exchange for US security guarantees.\n\nJohn Kirby, the retired US Navy admiral who serves as Biden's national security communications advisor, told reporters this week that the president \"has made revitalizing our relationships a key priority, recognizing that we are stronger when we act together and that today's challenges require global perspectives, global approaches, global responses, and multilateral effort and cooperation.\"\n\nHe also noted that Biden's visit to France comes amid tensions between the US and Europe over the response to Russia's war on Ukraine and Israel's continued war against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nWhile Biden and French president Emmanuel Macron are expected to discuss the importance of long-term support for Ukraine by the West, the specter of Trump -- and the consequences of the Republican's possible victory in November -- will loom over the talk. Trump has indicated that he would end all support for Kyiv in a second term.\n\nThe Gaza conflict will also be a possible point of contention between Biden and Macron, as he and other European leaders have criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's conduct of the war, which according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry has killed more than 36,000 people since it began, following the

But the trip serves as a crucial opportunity for the US president, as he stands to gain the support of allies in Europe ahead of the upcoming presidential election - and give them a chance to contrast his leadership with that of former president Donald Trump, who could soon be re-elected.\n\nPerhaps in a preview of what's to come, in a fundraiser on Monday, the president reminded donors of Trump's comments that he made in France in 2018, when he canceled a trip to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and infamously referred to soldiers buried there as \"losers\" and \"suckers\".\n\n\"'Losers and suckers!' Who in the hell does he think he is?\" Biden said. \"This guy does not deserve to be president, whether or not I'm running.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, when asked whether Biden would visit the cemetery, John Kirby, the White House national security communications adviser, confirmed he would be visiting the cemetery. Kirby added: \"Our commitment to honor that sacrifice should never waver. And our obligations to those they leave behind, even though it may be generations ago, can never be lessened.\"\n\nTo further this contrast to his predecessor, according to the White House, Biden is expected to deliver a speech later this week focusing on democracy and freedom, both of which, he said during his State of the Union address in March, were \"under attack\" both at home and overseas.\n\nAs president, Trump withdrew from the Paris Climate Accord, threatened to \"quit\" Nato, and touted an \"America First\" agenda, leaving a wake of frayed relationships the world over.\n\nThe president will likely try to emphasize a contrast in his leadership during his trip, which comes just months before the presidential election. Biden \"has made revitalizing our relationships a key priority, recognizing of course that we are stronger when we act together and that today's challenges require global solutions and global responses\", Kirby said.\n\nTo underscore his priorities, during his trip to France for the 75th anniversary of D-Day, then-president Trump focused on blasting then-House speaker Nancy Pelosi and special counsel Robert Mueller. His criticisms of those at home came in stark contrast with the backdrop of the French cemetery.\n\nHowever, Biden will also need to address the elephant in the room: his approach to the ongoing war in Gaza that clashes with the approach of many EU nations.\n\nThe brutal crisis has continued since 7 October when Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel that killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 people hostage. Israel since has waged attacks on Gaza, killing an estimated 36,000 people, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health.\n\nWhile France is mulling recognizing a Palestinian state - as three European nations have already done - the US, under Biden, has offered some to Gaza while also supplying weapons to Israel. Biden also recently rejected the International Criminal Court's request to issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders over its war crimes against Hamas.\n\nAddressing the world leaders being at odds, Kirby said on Tuesday: \"Disagreements with allies and partners is not something new to President Biden any more than unity and cooperation and collaboration, which he also fosters across a range of issues.\"\n\nPresident Biden last week announced a \"roadmap to an enduring ceasefire and the release of all hostages\".\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has expressed support for Biden's plan.\n\n\"This deal should reopen a credible perspective for the implementation of a two-state solution, the only one able to provide Israel with the necessary security guarantees and to respond to the legitimate aspirations of Palestinians,\" said Mr Macron, according to Le Monde.\n\nHe also emphasized that Gaza be \"an integral part of a future Palestinian state, and a reformed and reinforced Palestinian Authority, with the help of the international community, should ensure its governance\".", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors":

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nWhen President Joe Biden appears in Normandy to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day, he will invoke the memory of that fight against the forces of fascism and draw contrasts with his own predecessor who rejected the alliances of Europe, and world order that emerged from the wreckage of the Second World War.\n\nBiden is set to join more than 24 world leaders, and some of the last surviving veterans of the 1944 battle, to mark the day that British, American, and Canadian soldiers landed in France to begin the ten-month process of liberating Europe that would end with the death of Hitler and defeat of Nazi Germany.\n\nAccording to the White House, Biden is set to deliver remarks at the D-Day commemoration ceremony on Thursday, as well as give a separate speech on the topic of democracy and freedom the next day in Paris.\n\nBoth speeches are billed as official events which have no ties to his ongoing re-election fight against former president Donald Trump. But even if he doesn't mention his predecessor by name, the timing of his visit and the possibility of a change in administration after the US election make the contrasts undeniable.\n\nThat contrast will be underscored by the official theme of the D-Day commemoration, one of nations unifying against the renewed, rising threat of authoritarianism. It's a theme that dovetails closely with the main thrust of Biden's 2024 White House bid, which has portrayed Trump as an authoritarian threat and the US election as just one front in a larger war between democracy and autocracy.\n\nBiden's campaign has also argued that Trump, a convicted felon who has threatened to jail his political opponents in retaliation for his prosecution on nearly 100 charges across four jurisdictions, is a singular threat who could end America's nearly 250-year existence as a democracy if given another four years in the White House.\n\nThe president's trip to Normandy will highlight stark contrasts with a similar visit made by Trump in 2020, during which he refused to visit a cemetery where American marines were buried after falling in battle during the First World War. At the time, he described the honored dead as \"suckers and losers\" in remarks which have been widely reported and confirmed by his second White House chief of staff, retired US Marine general John Kelly.\n\nBiden, the father of a combat veteran who will visit the cemetery where Trump refused to tread on Friday, has repeatedly referenced his predecessor's disdain for America's fallen, including during remarks at a fundraiser earlier this week when he angrily said Trump \"does not deserve to be president, whether or not I'm running\".\n\nHe's also drawn contrasts with Trump on the subject of Nato, the transatlantic defense pact baptized in blood on the Normandy shores eight decades ago. While Biden has led efforts to bring two new members -- Finland and Sweden -- into Nato as a result of Russia's ongoing invasion against Ukraine, Trump has repeatedly threatened to pull America out of the alliance, which he routinely describes incorrectly as a protection racket or a country club with allied nations paying \"dues\" in exchange for US security guarantees.\n\nJohn Kirby, the retired US Navy admiral who serves as Biden's national security communications advisor, told reporters this week that the president \"has made revitalizing our relationships a key priority, recognizing that we are stronger when we act together and that today's challenges require global perspectives, global approaches, global responses, and multilateral effort and cooperation.\"\n\nHe also noted that Biden's visit to France comes amid tensions between the US and Europe over the response to Russia's war on Ukraine and Israel's continued war against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nWhile Biden and French president Emmanuel Macron are expected to discuss the importance of long-term support for Ukraine by the West, the specter of Trump -- and the consequences of the Republican's possible victory in November -- will loom over the talk. Trump has indicated that he would end all support for Kyiv in a second term.\n\nThe Gaza conflict will also be a possible point of contention between Biden and Macron, as he and other European leaders have criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's conduct of the war, which according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry has killed more than 36,000 people since it began, following the October 7 terror attacks.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It was the opening of this critical second front on the European continent that proved to be the death knell for Nazi Germany (via CBS News):\n\nPresident Biden and key U.S. allies were in Normandy Thursday to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the U.S.-led allied forces' D-Day invasion of Nazi-occupied France. The brazen air and sea invasion would mark the beginning of the end of World War II, leading to the defeat of Adolf Hitler's Nazi German forces in Europe less than a year later.\n\nMr. Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were together to mark the most significant victory of the Western allies in the war, as well as the largest seaborne invasion in history. Mr. Biden is in France through the weekend for D-Day anniversary commemorations and plans to meet with leaders of key allies during his visit.\n\n\"What the allies did here 80 years ago, far surpassed anything we could have done on our own,\" Mr. Biden said in remarks Thursday. \"Together, we won the war.\"\n\nThe president of the United States should attend these ceremonies, though issues about Biden's age and mental health reared its ugly head during the event.\n\nWhen Biden arrived yesterday, he was totally gassed -- a lid was called virtually when Air Force One touched down in Europe. Second, on stage today, Biden appeared to have a brain malfunction. Whatever this was, it was awkward:\n\nAlso, did Joe fall asleep?\n\nSome might consider Biden's invoking of the Russia-Ukraine war in his D-Day address to be unseemly. As you know, Russia was an ally that suffered the highest death toll of the war, with at least 20 million people dead. Sixteen days after D-Day, Soviet forces launched their own summer offensive -- Operation Bagration -- which destroyed Germany's Army Group Centre and also accelerated the end of World War II. This defeat was especially damaging for the Third Reich, not least because of the 500,000 casualties they suffered, but the core of the Wehrmacht's officer corps was also either killed or captured.\n\nThe Biden White House has been working non-stop trying to pivot and neutralize any story about the president's mental health. The Wall Street Journal published a lengthy and rather damning piece about how Biden is slipping behind closed doors.\n\nYet, Biden's allies, to no one's surprise, have continued to describe the man as acute and sharp as a tack.\n\nNo one believes that. In May, Biden had a similar awkward moment, where many suggested he had an accident in front of the White House Press Corps.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

democracy, and address US foreign policy on Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\nMr Biden, who is running for re-election in November, will continue a long tradition of US presidents commemorating the anniversary of the beach landing of about 160,000 Allied soldiers in Normandy on June 6, 1944 - an event that set the stage for the liberation of Europe and the defeat of Nazi Germany.\n\n\"American and Allied forces exhibited remarkable bravery on D-Day and throughout the war, and their bold defence upheld freedom and democracy everywhere,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said in a preview of the visit.\n\n\"That war showed the world the value of strong alliances and partnerships, which is a lesson that continues to resonate strongly today, both in Europe and, quite frankly, well beyond Europe.\"\n\nThe four-day trip will be Mr Biden's first state visit to France since taking office in 2021.\n\nOn Friday, he will deliver a speech on \"democracy and freedom\" at Pointe du Hoc, the White House said, where US Army Rangers scaled high cliffs and seized German weapons.\n\nAnd on Saturday, he will meet French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris.\n\nBefore heading back to the US on Sunday, Mr Biden and his wife Jill Biden will visit the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, a First World War memorial in northern France where about 2,300 soldiers are buried.\n\nThe visit to Nato ally France comes as he faces a tightly contested rematch in November against Donald Trump, the former president who has spoken scathingly of Nato partners and called into question the importance and continued US membership of the alliance.\n\nSince taking office, Mr Biden has made strengthening Nato a core focus of his foreign policy agenda, supporting and arming Ukraine as it fends off Russia's invasion.\n\nUnder his watch, Nato has grown to 32 members after Finland and Sweden joined following Russia's attack on its neighbour.\n\n\"This visit will come at an important moment as Ukraine continues to face down Russian threats in its east and north, and as we are working to address the humanitarian crisis in the Middle East,\" Mr Kirby said.\n\nMr Macron has shown support to the Israel-Gaza peace plan Mr Biden unveiled last week.\n\nMore than two dozen heads of state are scheduled to attend the D-Day commemoration ceremonies, among them Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nMr Kirby said no official meeting between Mr Zelenskyy and Mr Biden had been scheduled so far.\n\nMr Biden has recently given Ukraine approval to use US-made weapons inside a limited area of Russia, as Kyiv tries to counter Moscow's advances in the Kharkiv region.\n\nMr Biden has sought to focus his re-election campaign on protecting the US from the return of Trump, who was last week convicted of 34 felonies.\n\nIn comments that shocked global leaders, Trump in March said he would encourage Russia to do \"whatever the hell they wanted\" to Nato countries that did not spend enough on defence.\n\nThe presumptive Republican nominee has championed the idea of an \"America First\" approach to US foreign policy.\n\nMr Biden, a Democrat, has opposed that approach and presented his vision for continued US engagement with the world.\n\n\"We're at an inflection point in history,\" Mr Kirby said. \"And it's not tied to elections, whether they're here in the UK or anywhere else for that matter.\n\n\"[Mr Biden] believes it's tied to the way geopolitics are changing, the way challenges are being presented to us all around the world in different ways.\"\n\nDays after returning from France, Mr Biden is due to travel to southern Italy to attend the G7 Leaders' Summit.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nPresident Joe Biden arrived in France to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion, where he will likely try to remind European allies of his role as a world leader, while distancing himself from his \"America First\" predecessor, ahead of the November election.\n\nBiden touched down on Wednesday in Paris to pay respect to Second World War veterans. But the trip serves as a crucial opportunity for the US president, as he stands to gain the support of allies in Europe ahead of the upcoming presidential election - and give them a chance to contrast his leadership with that of former president Donald Trump, who could soon be re-elected.\n\nPerhaps in a preview of what's to come, in a fundraiser on Monday, the president reminded donors of Trump's comments that he made in France in 2018, when he canceled a trip to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and infamously referred to soldiers buried there as \"losers\" and \"suckers\".\n\n\"'Losers and suckers!' Who in the hell does he think he is?\" Biden said. \"This guy does not deserve to be president, whether or not I'm running.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, when asked whether Biden would visit the cemetery, John Kirby, the White House national security communications adviser, confirmed he would be visiting the cemetery. Kirby added: \"Our commitment to honor that sacrifice should never waver. And our obligations to those they leave behind, even though it may be generations ago, can never be lessened.\"\n\nTo further this contrast to his predecessor, according to the White House, Biden is expected to deliver a speech later this week focusing on democracy and freedom, both of which, he said during his State of the Union address in March, were \"under attack\" both at home and overseas.\n\nAs president, Trump withdrew from the Paris Climate Accord, threatened to \"quit\" Nato, and touted an \"America First\" agenda, leaving a wake of frayed relationships the world over.\n\nThe president will likely try to emphasize a contrast in his leadership during his trip, which comes just months before the presidential election. Biden \"has made revitalizing our relationships a key priority, recognizing of course that we are stronger when we act together and that today's challenges require global solutions and global responses\", Kirby said.\n\nTo underscore his priorities, during his trip to France for the 75th anniversary of D-Day, then-president Trump focused on blasting then-House speaker Nancy Pelosi and special counsel Robert Mueller. His criticisms of those at home came in stark contrast with the backdrop of the French cemetery.\n\nHowever, Biden will also need to address the elephant in the room: his approach to the ongoing war in Gaza that clashes with the approach of many EU nations.\n\nThe brutal crisis has continued since 7 October when Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel that killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 people hostage. Israel since has waged attacks on Gaza, killing an estimated 36,000 people, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health.\n\nWhile France is mulling recognizing a Palestinian state - as three European nations have already done - the US, under Biden, has offered some to Gaza while also supplying weapons to Israel. Biden also recently rejected the International Criminal Court's request to issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders over its war crimes against Hamas.\n\nAddressing the world leaders being at odds, Kirby said on Tuesday: \"Disagreements with allies and partners is not something new to President Biden any more than unity and cooperation and collaboration, which he also fosters across a range of issues.\"\n\nPresident Biden last week announced a \"roadmap to an enduring ceasefire and the release of all hostages\".\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has expressed support for Biden's plan.\n\n\"This deal should reopen a credible perspective for the implementation of a two-state solution, the only one able to provide Israel with the necessary security guarantees and to respond to the legitimate aspirations of Palestinians,\" said Mr Macron, according to Le Monde.\n\nHe also emphasized that Gaza be \"an integral part of a future Palestinian state, and a reformed and reinforced Palestinian Authority, with the help of the international community, should ensure its governance\".", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"},

And the contrast with Trump, you don't have to put into a partisan context,\" said Daniel Fried, a former US diplomat now at the Atlantic Council.\n\nThen Mr Biden will visit the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, the subject of a bombshell report about Mr Trump during the last presidential election.\n\nThe Atlantic reported that Mr Trump in 2018 cancelled a visit to the graveyard - which serves as a final resting place for US troops killed in World War I - because he was concerned about the impact of heavy rain on his hair, and that he belittled Americans who died in the nation's wars as \"suckers\" and \"losers\".\n\nMr Biden has frequently seized on the reporting to criticise Mr Trump, who blamed logistical problems caused by the weather for the scheduling change and has denied disparaging US troops.\n\nMr Biden offered a preview of his remarks on Monday (Tuesday AEST), tying the struggle against fascism during World War II to the US election.\n\n\"Democracy is literally on the ballot this year,\" Mr Biden told donors at a fundraiser in Connecticut. \"The future of democracy and freedom is at stake. We have brave soldiers who gave their lives on the beaches of Normandy who did their part.\"\n\nBut even as Mr Biden has declared his intention to revitalise alliances, his actions outside of Ukraine have strained some of those relationships. Steadfast support for Israel's war against Hamas has isolated him from European leaders more willing to condemn the military campaign that killed thousands of Palestinian civilians.\n\nThe White House's attempts to counter China and boost domestic manufacturing also come at the expense of European auto, technology, and green energy industries, causing friction with Mr Biden's host, French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThat's left US partners struggling to navigate the politics and economics of a post-pandemic world. And with ascendant developing nations more sceptical of the West, the liberal order established after World War II appears at its most vulnerable point in decades.\n\n\"Disagreements with allies and partners is not something new to President Biden, any more than unity and cooperation and collaboration, which he also fosters,\" White House spokesman John Kirby said.\n\nThe White House is eager to use the president's trip through France, the longest visit to a single country of his presidency, to evoke the past in hopes of rallying the world -- and American voters.\n\nFresh US aid for Ukraine was held up by Republicans in the US Congress for months, which many Europeans took as a warning sign about what might happen if Mr Trump wins. Mr Biden is expected to discuss the issue this week during a state visit with Mr Macron.\n\n\"He'll talk about the dangers of isolationism and how, if we bow to dictators, fail to stand up to them, they keep going and ultimately America and the world pays a greater price,\" White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said.\n\nThe expression \"politics stops at the water's edge\" was once a guidepost for US presidents travelling overseas, but not in this deeply polarised moment. With polls showing Mr Biden struggling to gain traction -- and European capitals rattled by the prospect of a second Trump term -- the president is making the case that he is a bulwark of democracy.\n\n\"The world will be watching. More importantly, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, will be watching,\" pollster Frank Luntz said this week on Bloomberg Television.", "source": {"uri": "afr.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Sections of three motorways, including the A13, were also shut down to allow President Biden and his multiple-car entourage to reach the D-Day commemorations.\n\n\"This caused 250 miles of traffic jams,\" said a traffic control official in Paris. \"There were plenty of angry motorists about.\"\n\nREAD MORE: WW2 veteran, 102, dies on his way to Normandy commemoration\n\nAfter the traffic mayhem, Biden met with American D-Day veterans to mark the invasion's 80th anniversary. Veterans who could stand were assisted out of their wheelchairs to take photos with the president and first lady Jill Biden. One veteran embraced Biden, while another saluted him.\n\nWhen Biden discovered it was one of the veterans' birthday, he led the crowd in singing Happy Birthday. The First Lady held onto the arm of another veteran, Robert Gibson, to help him stand next to Biden for a handshake.\n\n\"Don't get old,\" the centenarian quipped to the 81-year-old president, who was just a toddler when D-Day occurred.\n\nBiden is poised to give a speech as leaders gather to mark the anniversary of 150,000 allied troops storming the beaches. In his address, Biden will draw parallels between Europe's struggle to defeat the Nazis in WWII and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, as Russian President Vladimir Putin intensifies his assaults.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US .\n\n\"Today, in 2024, 80 years later, we see dictators once again attempting to challenge the order, attempting to march in Europe,\" said National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. He added that \"freedom-loving nations need to rally to stand against that as we have.\"\n\nSullivan further stated that the President will \"be drawing a throughline from World War II through the Cold War and the stand up of the greatest military alliance the world has ever known, the NATO alliance, to today, where we face once again war in Europe, where NATO has rallied to defend freedom and sovereignty in Europe.\"\n\nBiden is set to deliver his remarks at the American Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer, home to 9,388 American graves, most of which are marked by white Latin crosses. The Walls of the Missing also lists 1,557 service members declared missing in action.\n\nHis speech will follow his morning meet-and-greet with WWII veterans who participated in the landings, including some who are over 100 years old.\n\nThe D-Day Anniversary Commemoration Ceremony will be graced by world leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron. Notably, Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, who collaborated on the D-Day invasion film Saving Private Ryan, will also be in attendance.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

Reagan's remarks came in the face of the Soviet Union during the closing years of the Cold War, saying, \"We've learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments with an expansionist intent.\"\n\nBiden mirrored Reagan's anti-isolationist remarks: \"The United States and NATO, a coalition of more than 50 countries standing strong with Ukraine. We will not walk away because if we do, Ukraine will be subjugated, and it will not end there. All of Europe will be threatened.\"\n\nThe president also matched Reagan in his remarks about NATO.\n\n\"America is invested in our alliances and forged new ones, not simply out of altruism, but out of our own self-interest as well,\" Biden said.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nBiden's praise of the alliance forged to rebut Russia echoed Reagan's sentiments 40 years earlier: \"The strength of America's allies is vital to the United States, and the American security guarantee is essential to the continued freedom of Europe's democracies.\"\n\nBiden is hoping to reap much of the same effects as Reagan's speech. The former president's 1984 address helped him to a second term in the White House as voters grew more confident in his approach to foreign policy.\n\nBiden will also deliver remarks from Pointe Du Hoc, a clifftop that special operations forces mounted in a significant raid on D-Day, on Friday. Reagan did the same.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThursday's commemoration will likely be the last for many U.S. WWII veterans as even a 17 year old, the minimum age to enlist with parental consent then, who took part in the assault would be around 97 today.\n\nBiden has some other similarities to Reagan. Much like Reagan, Biden's age and cognitive ability have been a hot topic in the lead-up to his reelection bid. Biden took the oldest president title from former President Donald Trump, who took it from Reagan, when he took office in 2021.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Reagan's remarks came in the face of the Soviet Union during the closing years of the Cold War, saying, \"We've learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments with an expansionist intent.\"\n\nBiden mirrored Reagan's anti-isolationist remarks: \"The United States and NATO, a coalition of more than 50 countries standing strong with Ukraine. We will not walk away because if we do, Ukraine will be subjugated, and it will not end there. All of Europe will be threatened.\"\n\nThe president also matched Reagan in his remarks about NATO.\n\n\"America is invested in our alliances and forged new ones, not simply out of altruism, but out of our own self-interest as well,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden's praise of the alliance forged to rebut Russia echoed Reagan's sentiments 40 years earlier: \"The strength of America's allies is vital to the United States, and the American security guarantee is essential to the continued freedom of Europe's democracies.\"\n\nBiden is hoping to reap much of the same effects as Reagan's speech. The former president's 1984 address helped him to a second term in the White House as voters grew more confident in his approach to foreign policy.\n\nBiden will also deliver remarks from Pointe Du Hoc, a clifftop that special operations forces mounted in a significant raid on D-Day, on Friday. Reagan did the same.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThursday's commemoration will likely be the last for many U.S. WWII veterans as even a 17 year old, the minimum age to enlist with parental consent then, who took part in the assault would be around 97 today.\n\nBiden has some other similarities to Reagan. Much like Reagan, Biden's age and cognitive ability have been a hot topic in the lead-up to his reelection bid.

The spokesperson on Friday evening hit back at baseless accusations made by a U.S. State Department spokesperson and British Foreign Secretary David Cameron on the verdict of the High Court of the HKSAR on the \"conspiracy to commit subversion\" case. It is inexplicable that some countries are upset about legitimate measures taken by the HKSAR to safeguard national security, the spokesperson said. The Chinese government has been fully, accurately and faithfully implementing the principles of \"one country, two systems,\" Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong and a high degree of autonomy. After the implementation of the national security law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance, Hong Kong's political ecology has improved, public order has been restored, the spirit of the rule of law has been protected, the business environment has become better, and people in Hong Kong enjoy a better living and working environment, the spokesperson said, adding \"This is a fact that anyone who does not wear 'tinted glasses' can not deny.\" Legitimate actions by the judiciary of the HKSAR brook no interference, the spokesperson said. \"The Chinese people will never back down before pressure. History and facts have proven that noise, intimidation and sanctions will only enable clear-eyed people to see the sinister intention of external forces to disrupt Hong Kong and use Hong Kong to contain China. It will only make all Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots, more united,\" the spokesperson said.", "summary": "<p>HONG KONG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The so-called \"primary election\" seriously challenged the constitutional order of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and those who violated the law must be held to justice, a spokesperson for the Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the HKSAR has said.</p><p> The spokesperson on Friday evening hit back at baseless accusations made by a U.S. State Depart", "url": "https://www.beijingbulletin.com/news/274392372/law-violators-must-be-held-to-justice-commissioner-office-of-chinese-foreign-ministry-in-hksar", "image": "https://static.midwestradionetwork.com/story_logos/premier/beijing-bulletin.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:06:01", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "au", "sentiment": 0.187}

The BJP had been a junior alliance partner of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in Punjab. Who gets which ministry in Modi 3.0? Form your 'Dream Cabinet' and win prizes.link__elec{padding:0 0 12px} .link__elec div{margin-bottom:7px;}.link__elec a{color: var(--linkcolor); text-decoration: underline;font-size:18px; line-height:24px; font-weight:600;} The BJP has tried to forge a path alone in Punjab since the SAD parted ways with it in September 2020 amid the farmers' agitation against the now-withdrawn farm laws.Bittu was defeated by Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh Raja Warring in Ludhiana in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.Despite the loss, the BJP believes, Bittu is among the popular leaders who are likely to make an impact on the party as it goes it alone in Punjab.On Sunday, a video of Ravneet Singh Bittu ditching his car and running on the street to attend PM Modi's meeting went viral.The video shows Bittu running and crossing a roundabout with his guards before entering the premises of Narendra Modi's 7, Lok Kalyan Marg home. Another reason why Bittu's inclusion in the Union ministry is significant is because he is the grandson of Beant Singh, one of the key faces of the anti-militancy campaign in Punjab. Beant Singh, a Congress leader, was assassinated while he was still the Chief Minister of Punjab.Two Khalistani sympathisers, Amritpal Singh and Sarabjit Singh Khalsa, won the 2024 Lok Sabha election from Punjab.Amritpal Singh, 'Waris Punjab De' chief, who is in Dibrugarh jail under terror charges from Khadoor Sahib by a margin of 1,97,120 votes, the highest in Punjab.Sarabjit Singh, son of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's assassin, won the Faridkot Lok Sabha seat by a margin of 70,053 votes.The inclusion of Ravneet Singh Bittu in the Prime Minister's Narendra Modi-led Union ministry is therefore significant for the BJP as it tries to grow in Punjab. It is also symbolic amid the victory of the Khalistani sympathisers.Published By: Sushim MukulPublished On: Jun 9, 2024Must Watch", "summary": "<a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bjp-ravneet-singh-bittus-inclusion-in-team-narendra-modi-30-signify-2551064-2024-06-09\"> <img align=\"left\" hspace=\"2\" height=\"180\" width=\"305\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/bittu-minister-punjab-ludhiana-090852823-16x9_0.png?VersionId=BNj2KV3.XKxdPlo2XFrKostgYXnX7LFX\"> </a> Why Ravneet Singh Bittu, who lost from Ludhiana, is in Modi 3.0", "url": "https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bjp-ravneet-singh-bittus-inclusion-in-team-narendra-modi-30-signify-2551064-2024-06-09", "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/bittu-minister-punjab-ludhiana-090852823-16x9_0.png?VersionId=BNj2KV3.XKxdPlo2XFrKostgYXnX7LFX?size=1280:720", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:18:27", "author": null, "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.002}

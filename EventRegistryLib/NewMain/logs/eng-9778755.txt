Not like him, because he has a lot of quality, but we have a lot of resources.\"\n\nAncelotti on the tactical impact of Kroos' departure\n\n\"Vertical play is what we also wanted with Kroos. If you get into the opposition half quickly you have more chances to create problems for the opposition. Where will Bellingham play? The closer he is to the box the better. We have Modric, Tchoaumeni, Valverde. We have the idea to defend well and repeat what we did well last year.\"\n\nAncelotti on Endrick\n\n\"He is very young, very powerful, very fast. I'm not going to ask too much of him because we have to bear in mind that it's an exciting time for him. He will play 45 minutes tomorrow. We are delighted to have him with us.\"\n\nAncelotti on R\u00fcdiger's training tackles on Endrick\n\n\"Nothing happened. If he said anything to him, I don't know. Antonio is a fantastic player and a great teammate.\"\n\nAncelotti on his message to youth players\n\n\"They are very focused. They want to learn, to listen, to improve. Coaching them, for me, is very nice. I like them all. They all have quality. I don't know if they will play for Real Madrid, but they have a future.\"\n\nAncelotti on how Real Madrid stays at the top\n\n\"There are many things. This club has built a project, thanks to the history and the people who govern. The president and the general manager have built a spectacular squad. It is the key for Madrid to be the best club in the world.\"\n\nAncelotti on Javier Aguirre becoming Mexico coach and his chance to join Brazil\n\n\"I have a very good relationship with Javier and I wish him all the best. He has a great opportunity to prepare well for the World Cup, at home. I will be a fan of Mexico, as I was at the World Cup in Russia. The Brazil thing is something from last year.\"\n\nAncelotti on a possible change in system\n\n\"The system we are going to use can be a 4-3-3 or a 4-4-2. Like we did last year. Sometimes it was 4-2-3-1.... We have the resources to use those systems.\"\n\nAncelotti on playing as many as 72 games\n\n\"The season can be long, hopefully it will be. That's what we want when a season starts, to be competitive. We don't have a specific physical plan, because it's very complicated to think about a physical plan when you play every three days. We have always been very good at the end of the year and this season I think it will be the same. We have to think about individual breaks, so as not to exhaust the players.\"\n\nAncelotti on Milan\n\n\"Milan is doing a good job. I wish them all the best. I have very good memories. The Milanisti miss Paolo Maldini, but this is football. They have signed a fantastic striker like Morata, Camarda is very good. It will be a game for the youngsters.\"\n\nAncelotti on the Super Cup\n\n\"The Super Cup is a bit far away and we are concentrating on the players we have now.

Little by little we are seeing the players. At the moment we have worked well and evaluated the youngsters from the youth academy.\n\n\"Everyone who arrives is in good shape.

As I said, we don't have much time to prepare for the first few games, but the players will come back in good shape.\n\n\"They have a programme that starts 15 days before they arrive.

Not like him, because he has a lot of quality, but we have plenty.\"\n\nOn whether Jude Bellingham has the capability to replace the German, the manager said: \"Vertical play is what we wanted also with Kroos. If you get into the opposition half quickly you have more chances to create problems for the opposition.\n\n\"Where will Bellingham play? The closer he is to the box the better. We have Modric, Tchoaumeni, Valverde. We have the idea to defend well and repeat what we did well last year.\"\n\nDiscussing the arrival of Endrick, who has impressed in training, Ancelotti said: \"He is very young, powerful, very fast. I'm not going to ask too much of him because we have to keep in mind that it's an exciting time for him.\n\n\"He will play 45 minutes tomorrow. We are delighted to have him with us.\"\n\nOn the training ground incident that saw Antonio Rudiger go hard in on Endrick in training, Ancelotti said:\n\n\"Nothing happened. If he said something to him, I don't know (laughs). Antonio is a fantastic player and a great team-mate.\"\n\nAncelotti has brought along a number of young players from the Real Madrid academy on the pre-season tour.

They all have quality. I don't know if they will play for Madrid, but they have a future.\"\n\nOn the formation that he plans to use with the team this season, the manager said: \"The system we are going to use can be a 4-3-3 or a 4-4-2.

However, the side was unable to get Lille's Leny Yoro, who joined Manchester United instead of Los Blancos.\n\nThough there were rumours that the La Liga club were still looking for a centre-back with the departure of Nacho and Rafa Marin, the Real Madrid manager has said that his squad is \"closed\". With Jesus Vallejo back in the mix, David Alaba in recovery and academy players Joan Martinez, Jacobo Ramon and Raul Asencio training with the side, Ancelotti believes his side has the spot covered. Luka Modric has just signed a one-year extension to his contract; Ferland Mendy, too is near his contract extension and Lucas Vasquez has renewed his deal with Madrid. So, the club might only make new signings in the next window in a scenario of injuries in the squad. They have been closely linked with Bayern Munich's Alphonso Davies, whose contract ends in 2025.\n\nReal Madrid saw the back of quite a few players. Nacho recently signed with Saudi Pro League side Al Qadsiah after playing with the Spanish giants for 13 years. Rafa Marin played the previous season on loan at Deportivo Alaves and has now joined Napoli on a permanent transfer. Joselu, too, left Madrid and moved to the Qatari team Al Gharafa.\n\nAncelotti maintained that he was sure that none of his other players would be leaving. He further added that the side would miss the former German midfielder, Toni Kroos. Kroos had a successful stay in Madrid during his nine years at the club. Despite this, Madrid are well-equipped to fill every gap in their squad for the coming season.\n\nThe biggest anticipation for Madrid is the arrival of Kylian Mbappe, whose record precedes him. While at PSG, Mbappe was one of the most sought-after players with a record of the most Golden boots in the tournament. To his name, the French captain has six Ligue 1 trophies, three Coupe de France, one UEFA Nations League and a World Cup that he won as a teenager for France.\n\nFellow new signing Endrick signed a six-year contract after moving from Palmeiras. The 18-year-old admitted about his lifelong ambition to play in Madrid, having looked up to former Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo. Though the starting XI may not have a place for him immediately, he will gain experience from the star-studded Madrid squad.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "roheen_ghosh@news9live.com", "name": "Roheen Ghosh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacho_(footballer,_born_1990)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nacho (footballer, born 1990)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marko_Marin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marko Marin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Alaba", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Alaba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lille", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lille"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lille"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonso_Davies", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphonso Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferland_Mendy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ferland Mendy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Professional_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Professional League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Modri\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Modri\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joselu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joselu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S.C._Napoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.S.C.

Increasingly, it looks like they will not move for another defender, despite missing out on Leny Yoro, who was to be their fourth centre-back this season.\n\nAs was the case with Jude Bellingham becoming Real Madrid's leading source of goals for much of last season, it seems Ancelotti has done too well, managing himself out of ability to demand players. He requested Harry Kane last summer, and this year too, he has asked for another centre-back after Yoro signed for Manchester United. He feels that they are not just short of a central defender, but with David Alaba out, all of their options are right-footed too.\n\nLos Blancos feel with Castilla centre-back Raul Asencio, Jesus Vallejo as an extra body and Aurelien Tchouameni perfectly capable in defence, there is no need to move for a defender they do not feel is right. The Athletic say they will not close the door on a move in case the right player comes along in the final weeks of the market, but Ancelotti has been told by the club that they have full faith in his ability to find solutions this season.\n\nThe Italian coach also asked for a signing in January of last year, when Alaba went down injured and was told to mend and make do. Ancelotti has certainly shown the ability to coach around shortages in the squad, but it is certainly risky. By rule of chance alone, it seems unlikely Ancelotti will contine to problem solve at such a prolific rate.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Alaba", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David Alaba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ittihad_Club_(Jeddah)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al-Ittihad Club (Jeddah)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karim_Benzema", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karim Benzema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_Castilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid Castilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jes\u00fas_Vallejo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jes\u00fas Vallejo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/HaG_v6QdXN4R014DXjgmAQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NjU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/football_espana_articles_993/6aeb8c4ac08a5b2deb45c81330aa2d4e", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778755", "eventUri": "eng-9778755", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

The departures of Nacho Fernandez and Rafa Marin have left only three fit senior options - Antonio Rudiger, Eder Militao and Jesus Vallejo. David Alaba is another, but he may not have finished his recovery from an ACL injury until later this year/2025.\n\nLos Blancos missed out on leading target Leny Yoro to Manchester United, and on the back of that, it's been widely reported that no one else will be pursued. Carlo Ancelotti has now confirmed this during his first press conference of the summer (via Diario AS), on the club's pre-season tour of the United States.\n\n\"The squad is closed. Vallejo is back, Alaba is recovering. We have the young people: Joan, Jacobo and Raul (Asencio). No one will be leaving because everyone wants to stay.\"\n\nAncelotti was also asked about how his side would be affected by the absence of Toni Kroos, following the German maestro's retirement from professional football earlier this month.\n\n\"Vertical play is what we wanted with Kroos as well. If you get to the opponent's half quickly, you have more chances of creating problems for the opponent. Where will Bellingham play? The closer he is to the penalty area, the better. We have Modric, Tchouameni, Valverde... We have the idea of defending well and repeating what we did well last year.\"\n\nIt's risky from Real Madrid to not sign a new central defender. They may have managed with only two fit players for a large part of last season, but that's not to say that they will be able to do so this time around.

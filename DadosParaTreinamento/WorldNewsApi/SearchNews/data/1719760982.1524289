(FAYEZ NURELDINE/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images The Biden administration is scrambling to secure a landmark deal with Saudi Arabia, which includes a defense pact. Even if it is implemented in the near future, and that\u2019s still a big if, it\u2019s unclear what advanced weaponry Riyadh might seek that it hasn\u2019t already been able to buy. The finalization of agreements related to the U.S.-Saudi deal, which includes a defense pact and unprecedented cooperation on nuclear energy, \u201ccould be weeks away,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a House of Representatives hearing on May 22. His remarks came three days after National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman to discuss the terms of the deal. Furthermore, the administration intends to lift its 3-year ban on selling offensive weapons to Riyadh within weeks, the Financial Times reported on May 26. These developments suggest the U.S.-Saudi deal is on the horizon. However, without Saudi-Israeli normalization, Congress won\u2019t approve any defense pact between Washington and Riyadh. Furthermore, normalization is contingent on Israel committing to the negotiated establishment of a Palestinian state, which it is highly reluctant to do under the incumbent right-wing government and in the general post-Oct. 7 environment. So, while Washington and Riyadh may indeed be on the verge of finalizing bilateral agreements on this landmark deal, it may not come to fruition anytime soon. But even if Saudi Arabia did secure a major defense pact, it probably would not change much regarding the American military hardware it could buy. In the 2010s, Riyadh bought 84 F-15SA, Saudi Advanced fighters, the most advanced F-15 until recent years\u2014the U.S. has since developed the similar Qatar Advanced variant for Riyadh\u2019s neighbor and then the F-15EX Eagle II, which Riyadh also has the option of buying.

On the ground, the kingdom has hundreds of M1 Abrams main battle tanks. And while there have been occasional proposals to restrict American arms sales to the kingdom, they haven\u2019t materialized or, in the case of the administration\u2019s offensive weapons ban, proved temporary. \u201cSaudi Arabia and Israel are already de facto security partners through the coordination done by the U.S. Central Command,\u201d Nicholas Heras, senior director of strategy and innovation at the New Lines Institute, told me. \u201cIsrael was added to the Central Command area of operations in late 2021, which was a move that reflected the growing ties between the Israelis and close U.S. partners in the Gulf.\u201d \u201cSaudi Arabia already enjoys a close partnership with the United States, and although there is stress in that partnership at times, the reality is that neither Washington nor Riyadh is willing to give up on hugging each other close,\u201d he said. When the United Arab Emirates normalized relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords in 2020, it received authorization for a landmark deal for 50 fifth-generation F-35 Lightning II stealth jets. It was the first time Washington agreed to sell the F-35 to an Arab ally. The deal has since stalled due to disagreements between the U.S. and UAE over the extent and nature of the latter\u2019s technological cooperation with China. As part of any defense pact with Riyadh, Washington will expect the kingdom to reduce arms purchases and similar technological cooperation with Beijing. A potential Saudi F-35 sale is something the administration is currently discussing as part of the deal. Saudi-Israel normalization could also permit Riyadh to buy advanced Israeli weaponry. The UAE has bought Israeli Barak and SPYDER air defense systems since 2020. Riyadh may seek Israel\u2019s combat-proven David\u2019s Sling to reinforce the middle tier of its air defenses alongside the KM-SAM system it recently ordered from South Korea. It\u2019s unclear if Israel would sell Saudi Arabia its exoatmospheric anti-ballistic missile Arrow 3 system. A Saudi Arrow 3 would undoubtedly go a long way in reinforcing the top tier of Saudi Arabia\u2019s air defense alongside the THAAD. Riyadh also seeks to become \u201can equal partner\u201d in a sixth-generation fighter program. It sought partnership in the UK-Japan-Italy Global Combat Air Programme to build the Tempest fighter, but Tokyo has proven reluctant. On the other hand, Germany recently lifted a 5-year ban on the sale of additional Eurofighter Typhoon jets to Saudi Arabia after it shot down missiles fired from Yemen by the Houthis at Israel last year. Normalization with Israel could see Berlin urging its fellow partners, France and Spain, in the sixth-generation Future Combat Air System to give Riyadh the full partnership it seeks in that program. Heras argued that Saudi Arabia\u2019s main aim in seeking this pact isn\u2019t to receive authorization to buy \u201cany specific weapon system\u201d from the U.S. \u201cEven the more advanced systems like the F-35 are years away, if ever, from reaching Saudi Arabia based on all the trouble that the UAE has acquiring the aircraft even in the wake of almost complete normalization with Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cFor Riyadh, the deal that is in question, and which depends on Israeli behavior, is the complete American underwriting of Saudi Arabia as a nuclear power protected by a U.S. defense agreement on par with NATO,\u201d he added. \u201cThat is the type of prize that would entice Saudi Arabia to officially normalize with Israel, giving the Biden administration a massive diplomatic win in an election year.\u201d Heras believes the fact the administration is pushing so hard for a deal now\u2014with the Gaza war ongoing and an uncertain post-war order\u2014illustrates how it \u201cdeeply believes that a pre-election Saudi-Israel deal\u201d will help Biden win reelection. It hopes to do so by shoring up the support of pro-Israel voters seeking \u201ca more assertive U.S. role in the world\u201d and signaling to Democratic voters that the Gaza crisis and broader Palestinian question is not \u201cthe epochal issue they think it is.\u201d \u201cThere is a definite air of gamesmanship in the Biden administration approach to this issue, as if it wants to prove without a shadow of a doubt that it can will geopolitics to its preferences and forge a deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia.\u201d Follow me on Twitter.

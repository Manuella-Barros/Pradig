{"id": 239779844, "title": "Goals, goals, goals ... Euro 2024 has treated us well", "text": "Long-distance goals There is no finer sight in football than a goal lashed in from distance and Euro 2024 has produced a plethora of memorable strikes to punctuate an almost endless succession of pulsating group games. Nicolae Stanciu\u2019s rocket in Romania\u2019s 3-0 win against Ukraine is the pick of the bunch: a swerving, dipping first-time strike whipped spectacularly into the top corner from 20 yards. Ukraine\u2019s goalkeeper, Andriy Lunin, dived for the shot but probably shouldn\u2019t have bothered. Stanciu\u2019s screamer was nearly matched by Xherdan Shaqiri\u2019s slick finish for Switzerland in the 1-1 draw against Scotland. The former Stoke forward\u2019s effort also originated from a defensive error and featured a comparable helping of whip and curl, almost a left-footed mirror image of Stanciu\u2019s. A wonderful curling hit by Lukas Provod, for the Czech Republic against Portugal, was of comparable quality. Those spectacular efforts were rivalled by Morten Hjulmand\u2019s crisp, powerful drive for Denmark that pegged England back to a 1-1 draw in Frankfurt. On the BBC Gary Lineker exaggerated when calling Hjulmand\u2019s shot \u201cone in a million\u201d, but any strike that cannons in off a post earns extra points for aesthetics. Florian Wirtz had set the tone with a goal from outside the area (but inside the \u201cD\u201d) by putting Germany ahead against Scotland on the opening night \u2014 although Angus Gunn should have done better \u2014 before Emre Can sealed the rout with a sweet stoppage-time curler from similar distance. Niclas F\u00fcllkrug\u2019s goal, the hosts\u2019 third in a 5-1 win, deserves a mention for the power and purity of the strike. Mert Muldur\u2019s astonishing volley for Turkey against Georgia was on the edge of the area \u2014 just inside, in fact \u2014 but Arda Guler\u2019s smooth, sweeping finish saw the Real Madrid midfielder announce his talent on the biggest stage and punish Georgia\u2019s defensive carelessness. Michel Aebischer (Switzerland), Nicol\u00f2 Barella (Italy), Cody Gakpo (Netherlands) and Erik Janza (Slovenia) have also found the back of the net from outside the area. Gakpo\u2019s and Janza\u2019s efforts were deflected, and the Slovenian\u2019s thunderous hit was spectacular despite taking a nick off a defender. With such a proliferation of long-distance goals and clean strikes, the players evidently feel confident of controlling adidas\u2019s \u201cFussballliebe\u201d (Love of football), which we can be sure is a significant upgrade on the dreaded Jabulani of 2010. Own goals Spain\u2019s attacking patterns and mesmeric passing saw Italy, the reigning champions, clinging on in Group B on Thursday. Driven on by the quicksilver Nico Williams and the 16-year-old Lamine Yamal, Spain dominated and might have scored five or six with more clinical finishing. But they needed a second-half own goal via Riccardo Calafiori\u2019s knee to earn three points. The unfortunate Italian defender was the fifth player inside a week to put through his own net: Antonio R\u00fcdiger, somewhat comically, glanced a header into Germany\u2019s goal to hand Scotland an opening-night consolation. Maximilian W\u00f6ber\u2019s own goal gifted France victory on Monday while Robin Hranac unintentionally kicked off Portugal\u2019s comeback in the 69th minute in Leipzig the next day. The most freakish incident was surely Klaus Gjasula\u2019s for Albania, though: Berat Djimsiti threw his body in the way of Luka Sucic\u2019s shot, only for the ball to cannon into Gjasula and ricochet back into the net. Happily for the 34-year-old, who has 10 different German clubs on his CV and has been released by Darmstadt this summer, he popped up with a 95th-minute equaliser to snatch a point. Late goals The tournament has also been notable for stoppage-time goals: there have been six scored beyond 90 minutes, including several decisive to the final result. Gjasula\u2019s aforementioned effort salvaged a 2-2 draw against Croatia in Group B, sparking passionate celebrations by his manager, the former Arsenal full-back Sylvinho. Can\u2019s late goal against Scotland did not change the result \u2014 neither did Breel Embolo\u2019s neat finish for Switzerland against Hungary. Kerem Akturkoglu\u2019s breakaway strike for Turkey came in the 97th minute and sealed a 3-1 win, and was most notable for being satisfyingly stroked into an empty net after the Georgian goalkeeper, Giorgi Mamardashvili, went up for a corner. Portugal\u2019s encounter with the Czech Republic burst into life late, Francisco Concei\u00e7\u00e3o slotting a dramatic winner for the 2016 champions in the second minute of stoppage time, while Luka Jovic struck with a header in the 95th minute for Serbia against Slovenia, allowing them to keep dreaming of progress from Group C. Late drama, own goals and a multitude of long-rangers are characterising Euro 2024. Is a Tony Yeboah-style volley, crashing in off the crossbar, too much to ask for?", "summary": "<p>This year\u2019s tournament in Germany has produced some great goals \u2013 here is a breakdown of the best strikes and why we are seeing them.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/international-soccer/goals-goals-goals-euro-2024-has-treated-us-well/a975096423.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/rUTTOaG1YJASTBgw5eDLzmsDbVk=/269x258:3041x2105/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/d45f1c12-e4fe-49d2-a386-6488fd744525/6c3beb46-a346-4d3c-a334-42a0eeb35753/d45f1c12-e4fe-49d2-a386-6488fd744525.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:30:00", "author": "Luke McLaughlin", "authors": ["Luke McLaughlin"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.006}

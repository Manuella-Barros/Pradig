The mega event will now be held on June 12 instead of June 10, 2024. On the other hand, the crucial meeting of the BJP legislative party which was also scheduled to be held on June 10, is likely to be held on June 11. PM Narendra Modi is scheduled to attend several crucial meetings on Monday. Hence, the oath-taking ceremony of the new Odisha Chief Minister will be held after two days, informed BJP spokesperson Jatin Mohanty. According to Mohanty, the oath-taking ceremony has been changed as PM Narendra Modi will be attending similar events in two other states. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to attend the oath-taking ceremony of the new Odisha CM which will be held at Janata Maidan in Bhubaneswar. Sources said PM Modi, who led the party\u2019s poll campaign in Odisha, will hold a mega roadshow in Bhubaneswar on Wednesday as a mark of gratitude to the people of the state. The BJP won 20 of the 21 Lok Sabha seats, and 78 of the 147 assembly seats in the state. The BJP\u2019s astounding success in the Odisha Assembly polls marked the end of 24 years of rule of Naveen Patnaik of the Biju Janata Dal. Sources said BJP's parliamentary party is likely to select the chief minister of Odisha after Narendra Modi takes oath as the country's prime minister for the third term today. The parliamentary party of the BJP would select the chief minister at its meeting. Meanwhile, suspense still prevails as to who will be the new chief minister of the state. Though several names are doing the rounds in political circles, the names of a few leaders like Jual Oram, Suresh Pujari and Mohan Majhi are being discussed as front-runners in the race for the coveted post.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/odisha-new-cm-will-take-oath-on-june-12-pm-modi-to-hold-roadshow-in-bhubaneswar-898132", "image": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/06/09/1095983-modiatangul.webp", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:21:29", "author": "Akshaya Kumar Sahoo", "authors": ["Akshaya Kumar Sahoo"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.075}

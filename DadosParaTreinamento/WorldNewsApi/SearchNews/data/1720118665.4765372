He left his residence around 2:45 pm and also paid homage at Raj Ghat, accompanied by his wife. Earlier, Kejriwal thanked the Supreme Court via social media for allowing him to campaign for ongoing state elections, despite an arrest warrant issued against him relating to an excise policy case. Kejriwal had been granted interim bail until today to campaign for the Aam Aadmi Party. With campaigning now concluded, he reported as required to begin serving his sentence, pending a bail application decision. Party members have stated their readiness to operate the state government from prison, if his incarceration is extended. Kejriwal himself indicated plans to legally enable such an arrangement. The Chief Minister's regular bail plea was heard by a local court on Saturday, with a decision now reserved until June 5th following the conclusion of Lok Sabha elections. During proceedings, enforcement agencies argued the top court prohibited any bail extension, allowing only regular bail consideration. Kejriwal surrendered as mandated by the court, awaiting next week's ruling", "summary": "<p>Delhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal surrendered to Tihar Jail today, after visiting the historic Hanuman Temple located in Connaught Place, New Delhi earlier in the day.

{"id": 223749930, "title": "Sabrina Carpenter plays main stage at Big Weekend's final day in Luton", "text": "Sabrina Carpenter has made an early claim for song of the summer with her breezy pop anthem Espresso. Spun from sugar, fiendishly catchy and full of meme-able lyrics, it\u2019s been number one for the last four weeks \u2013 and the moment she plays the opening bars, Luton is going to kick off. Newcomers will be delighted to hear there\u2019s more to Sabrina than just that breakout hit. A former Disney star, she\u2019d been plugging away at a musical career for 10 years when her fifth (fifth!) album Emails I Can\u2019t Send finally connected. That was largely due to the viral success of the song Nonsense, and it\u2019s ad-libbed outro: \u201cThis song catchier than chickenpox is / I bet your house is where my other sock is\u201d. In concert, she regularly rewrites those lyrics to make them specific to the city she\u2019s in. So let\u2019s she what she comes up with as a rhyme for Luton. Crouton? Gluten? Susan? Oh, I give up.", "summary": "Coldplay, Olly Alexander and Vampire Weekend among today's acts at the BBC Radio 1 festival.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/entertainment-arts-69063954", "image": "https://m.files.bbci.co.uk/modules/bbc-morph-news-waf-page-meta/5.3.0/bbc_news_logo.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:58:41", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.57}

{"id": 239776040, "title": "Burnett Community Divided Over Renewables Push: Mayor", "text": "The South Burnett region sits on Queensland\u2019s Great Dividing Range, three hours from the capital of Brisbane. It is known for its agricultural industries including peanut farms and wineries, its quiet lifestyle, and postcard-perfect views. But the region has also become a hub for renewables in recent years and the local government says it feels powerless to do anything to stop the surge. Tarong, which sits within the South Burnett region, is one of the sites earmarked for a possible nuclear reactor if Peter Dutton is elected prime minister in the next federal election. Mayor Kathy Duff has welcomed the discussion on nuclear, saying she feels like there is a double standard when it comes to the environment and renewables. The region is already supporting wind and solar farms, with a battery farm on the way. \u201cIt is a big concern, because we\u2019re told that trees and koala habitat matter and now it seems you can push everything down and put up a solar farm wherever you want,\u201d Ms. Duff told The Epoch Times. The regional mayor says if someone owns a farm and their neighbour sells up, they could be living next door to a renewables hub with little say over it. It\u2019s something she says is tearing the community apart. Ms. Duff considers solar, wind, and battery farms as heavy industry, but has no control over where they go despite the council having a detailed zoning plan to ensure the community\u2019s comfort. When the council attempted a motion for a moratorium on a solar farm outside the town of Kingaroy, it lost in the Queensland\u2019s Planning and Environment Court. \u201cI believe our community deserves to have a look at other options,\u201d she said. Ms. Duff said the council was pleased to have been chosen as a nuclear site, because it was worth looking into. If the locals don\u2019t want it, the council won\u2019t support it, she says, but if it\u2019s something they want, there\u2019s merit in the discussion. Ms. Duff says it\u2019s worth investigating the job opportunities in the region with nuclear, which she thinks will offer more positions than renewables. \u201cI believe the time [between the idea and possible planning stages] gives us the opportunity to have a good look at it to see if it\u2019s safe and good for our community,\u201d she said. Nanango LNP MP Deb Frecklington and Queensland Opposition Leader David Crisafulli have both stated nuclear energy was not within their plan for the state. Ms. Frecklington, whose electorate is in the South Burnett region, says the issue is one for the federal Coalition, but from a state LNP perspective, it is not part of the plan. A sea of black panels covers about 118 hectares, with the devices said to last from 30 to 50 years. The solar farm is just one kilometre east of the main town of Kingaroy at the junction of the D'Aguilar and Bunya highways. An additional 673-hectare solar site has been earmarked by Tumuruu Solar for Blackbutt, which says the land had once been used for cattle grazing and was later found to have insufficient soil for crops. The 453-megawatt Coopers Gap Wind Farm is located 50 kilometres from Kingaroy, and until December 2010, was the largest wind farm in Australia. The wind farm holds 123 turbines and is powering around 232,000 homes. Victorian renewable energy company Akaysha has plans in the pipeline for a battery energy storage system at Ellesmere in the South Burnett region. The farm will store energy from wind and solar farms, feeding power into Ergon\u2019s Halys Substation. It sits on \u201cB-grade\u201d farmland, according to the group behind its construction. According to Akaysha, the battery farm will use Lithium iron Phosphate cell technology which is less expensive and safer than lithium-ion technology. Another battery farm is being built by Stanwell at Targon to catch energy from the Tarong West Wind Farm.", "summary": "A push for renewables in Queensland's South Burnett region, where a nuclear reactor has been proposed, is dividing the community, says Mayor Kathy Duff.", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/burnett-community-divided-over-renewables-push-mayor-5672693", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2023/09/22/id5496569-solarGettyImages-1242600846-300x180.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:32:52", "author": "Crystal-Rose Jones", "authors": ["Crystal-Rose Jones"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.0}

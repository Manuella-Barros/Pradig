Netanyahu warned that Israel is prepared for pre-emptive actions against Iran and Hezbollah -- both of whom have vowed to attack Israel.\n\nLast week, Israel assassinated Lebanon-based Hezbollah's military chief Faud Shukr in an airstrike in Beirut. Hours later, Iran and Hamas said that former Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh had been assassinated in Tehran. They blamed Israel for the assassination. Following the two assassinations, Iran and Hezbollah vowed to extract revenge. For the past week, the United States and Israel have assessed that the attack on Israel is imminent.\n\nThere are fears that the widely-expected Iranian-Hezbollah's attack and subsequent Israeli response may plunge the Middle East into an escalatory cycle that may lead to an all-out war that may envelop the entire region. Even as Western and Arab leaders have been pressing Iran and Israel to not escalate the conflict such that it leads to a full-scale war, Iran no longer appears to care. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Iran has conveyed to Arab leaders that it no longer cares if its attack on Israel leads to a full-scale war in the Middle East.\n\n'We are prepared for defence & offense'\n\nAs Israel braces for an attack from Iran and Hezbollah, Netanyahu has said that the Jewish state is ready for defensive as well offensive operations.\n\n\"We are prepared both defensively and offensively,\" said Netanyahu, as per The Jerusalem Post.\n\nNetanyahu further said that even as Israel prepares to defend against the Iranian attack, it's attacking its enemies.\n\n\"I know that the citizens of Israel are concerned, and I ask one thing of you: Be patient and level-headed. We are striking our enemies and are determined to defend ourselves,\" said Netanyahu.\n\nHezbollah may attack Israel before Iran: Report\n\nAs Israel and its partners, primarily the United States, brace for an attack from Iran, a report has said that Iran and Hezbollah may launch separate attacks.\n\nThe New York Times has cited Israeli and Western officials as saying that the assessment is that Hezbollah and Iran may attack Iran separately and Hezbollah may be the first to launch the attack.\n\nPreviously, it has been reported that Iran may involve its supported groups like Hezbollah and Houthis in the attack. Iran is widely believe to attack Israel like it did in April when it launched hundreds of missiles, drones, and rockets at Israel in response to the assassination of top Iranian commanders in an airstrike on the Iranian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital Damascus. The only difference is that the attack is expected to much bigger in scope this time and it would be much harder to deescalate.\n\nIsraeli outlet Ynet has reported that Israel has assessed that the attack may take place such that it opens war on as many as five fronts.\n\nThe United States is looking forward to reviving the Western and Arab coalition that help Israel defend itself in April. The US and Israeli militaries were joined by British, French, Jordanian, and Saudi militaries in taking down Iranian drones, missiles, and rockets in April. However, the revival of the coalition is proving to be much more difficult this time as anti-Israel sentiment has soared in the region following Haniyeh's assassination.", "source": {"uri":

The attack had a limited impact however, with only one casualty and little damage to Israeli infrastructure.\n\nCould Hezbollah act independently?\n\nOn Wednesday, CNN cited two US military officials as saying that the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah may strike Israel without coordinating with Iran.\n\nOne of the sources claimed that Hezbollah was planning to strike Israel in the coming days.\n\nThe doubts over an Iranian response come as talks on a ceasefire in Gaza continue. While the talks have long been stalled and Israel's assassination of Haniyeh, who played a key role in the negotiations, cast further doubt on them, US officials say progress is possible.\n\nAccording to Politico, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long refused to end Israel's brutal war on Gaza, is now more receptive to moving forward with negotiations after pressure from the Israeli security establishment.\n\nProgress on a ceasefire deal is likely to further lower the chances of Iran attacking Israel.\n\nThe war on Gaza has been going on for over 10 months, with nearly 40,000 Palestinians killed and at least 90,000 injured. The territory has been utterly devastated by the indiscriminate Israeli assault.", "source": {"uri": "newarab.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Arab"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ali Khamenei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Leader of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damascus"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Damascus"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.newarab.com/sites/default/files/styles/600x338/public/2147846368.jpeg?h=a5f2f23a&itok=SRTlHU2H", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799808", "eventUri": "eng-9799808", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Israel has not claimed responsibility for Haniyeh's death.\n\nThe Israeli official, who spoke with ABC News on condition of anonymity, suggested one red line for Israel, which could ratchet up tensions, would be an attack that harms or targets Israeli civilians.\n\n\"We don't have an interest in a war or escalation,\" the Israeli defense official said. \"But we won't tolerate attacks on our citizens.\"\n\nThe defensive preparations being made by Israel in conjunction with the United States were \"very critical,\" the official said.\n\n\"What we are seeing is the U.S. taking a very clear position in their actions and their messaging, and it matters,\" the Israeli defense official told ABC News.\n\nIn the wake of the assassinations, the Pentagon has announced it is moving two additional naval destroyers and a squadron of F-22 Raptor fighter jets into the Eastern Mediterranean as part of efforts to bolster defenses in and around Israel.\n\nIn an unusual step, U.S. officials also said a squadron of F-18 fighter jets from the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt were being redeployed to an undisclosed airbase in the Middle East.\n\nThe Israeli defense official said these redeployments of American military assets, which were aimed at defending Israel, appeared to be \"unprecedented\" in scale and scope.\n\n'Steeper hurdle' with regional allies\n\nThe Biden administration has also been talking to regional allies about efforts to defend Israel from a potential Iranian attack.\n\nHowever, U.S. diplomats told ABC News earlier this week they were \"facing a steeper hurdle\" convincing partners in the region to rejoin the defensive coalition, which rallied to protect Israel from attacks by more than 300 Iranian drones and missiles back in April.\n\nMany international partners see \"some of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's actions - particularly the killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran - as unnecessarily provocative,\" two U.S. officials familiar with the matter told ABC News earlier this week.\n\nAlthough Israel has not claimed responsibility for Haniyeh's death, neither has it denied that it carried out the assassination in the Iranian capital. Israel did claim responsibility for the strike on Beirut that killed Fuad Shukr.\n\nIran's Revolutionary Guard said in a statement released on Saturday that Israel would face \"severe punishment\" for the assassination, which they said would come at an appropriate time and place.\n\n'A fine balance'\n\nTwo former Israeli generals told ABC News they believed that if Iran attacks, that attack would likely be of a different type than the missile and drone barrage in April, which proved largely ineffective. Iran gave Israel and its allies hours of warning that the April attack was imminent. Analysts agree that there is not likely to be the same degree of warning ahead of any future attack.\n\n\"This time they must do something different ... something that will cause a much more painful price,\" former Israeli Gen. Yossi Kupperwasser, who was in charge of the Research Division at the Israel Defense Forces' (IDF) Intelligence Corps, told ABC News.\n\nKupperwasser said the delayed response from Iran was partly because the Iranians wanted \"to be sure that they are going to be successful.\" However, he noted, Iran also had to consider Israel's potential response to any attack.\n\n\"[The Iranian government] knows they are vulnerable. If Israel decides to retaliate then it can cause very painful damage. The Iranians have to take this into account,\" the former general told ABC News.\n\nAccording to Meir Javedanfar, a lecturer and senior research fellow at Israel's Lauder School of Government, Diplomacy and Strategy, the Iranian leadership faces a very delicate balancing act. Though Tehran has vowed it will act and will want to be seen to do something to deter Israel from future hostile acts, Iran cannot afford to hit Israel too hard and provoke a more potent response, he said.\n\n\"They know they need to get this right,\" Javedanfar told ABC news. \"It is a fine balance.\"\n\nRetired Israeli Major Gen. Amos Yadlin, who is now president and founder of the nonprofit national security consultancy MIND Israel, echoed that sentiment, telling ABC News that in a sense, Israel, Iran, and Iran's proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah, all face the same dilemma: calibrating their attacks so that they are effective, while trying to ensure they are not too effective, in a way that could lead to a broader conflict.\n\n\"They all want to achieve the goal of retaliation and deterrence [with their attacks]. However, none of them want to reach a full-scale war,\" Yadlin said.\n\nHezbollah under 'more pressure' than Iran to act\n\nOn Tuesday, the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, said his group would respond to the Israeli airstrike in Beirut on July 30, which killed Fuad Shukr.\n\nThe same Israeli defense official who told ABC News of the joint U.S.-Israeli preparations for a potential Iranian or Hezbollah attack further said that Israel's July 30 attack in southern Beirut was \"a direct response\" to a rocket attack on July 27 in Majdal Shams, in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, which killed 12 children and teenagers -- an attack for which Israel blames Hezbollah.\n\n\"Hezbollah crossed a red line,\" the defense official said.\n\nYadlin, who for five years was in charge of Israeli military intelligence, said Hezbollah \"is under more pressure than Iran to act.\"\n\nHezbollah \"lost the top military leader and they are trying to bring a clear red line that an attack on Beirut is unacceptable,\" he added.\n\nYadlin predicted Iran might wait longer to respond to the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in an explosion the early hours of July 31 in Tehran. Three Middle Eastern sources have previously told ABC News that Haniyeh was killed by a bomb, planted in his room in the Revolutionary Guard guesthouse, where he was staying for the inauguration of Iran's new president.\n\nYadlin told ABC News that the fact that it was a Palestinian leader killed in Tehran, and that he was not killed by a missile fired from outside of the country, gave Tehran some wriggle-room in its response.", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war", "type": "wiki",

Iran, meanwhile, appears to be still working out how to respond, the outlet added.\n\nIsrael said in late July that it had killed Hezbollah's top military commander Fu'ad Shukr in a strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut. The Jewish state is also widely believed to have been behind last week's assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Israel has not claimed responsibility for Haniyeh's death but had previously threatened to eliminate the leadership of the Palestinian militant group.\n\nHezbollah could strike with little or no notice due to being Israel's direct neighbor to the north, one of CNN's sources claimed.\n\nWest Jerusalem has warned that if the Lebanese-based group harms Israeli civilians as part of its retaliation, the Israel Defense Force's response would be disproportionate, Axios reported on Wednesday, citing Israeli officials.\n\nAccording to a report in Politico, Iran may be reconsidering launching a large-scale attack on Israel. The Biden administration has worked through diplomatic channels to discourage Tehran from a multi-pronged attack, highlighting a risk of a direct war between Iran and Israel, the outlet wrote on Thursday, citing senior US officials. It had been reported previously that Iran was expected to strike Israel on Monday.\n\nRussia has strongly condemned the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, warning that his death would negatively impact ceasefire talks between Hamas and Israel, and potentially spark a sharp escalation in the region.\n\nIn April, Iran fired hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel in response to the Israeli bombing of its consulate in Syria. The barrage was mostly countered by Israel's Iron Dome air-defense systems, but a number of missiles reached their targets, causing what Israel said was minimal damage to military installations.\n\nTensions between Iran and Israel peaked after Hamas launched a surprise attack on the Jewish state on October 7. In response, West Jerusalem started an offensive in Gaza, causing unprecedented destruction in the Palestinian enclave. Hostilities between Israel and Hamas have so far claimed the lives of more than 40,000 Palestinians and 1,400 Israelis.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jewish state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_enclaves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian enclaves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iron Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Syria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.08/article/66b486bf20302746eb355471.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799808", "eventUri": "eng-9799808", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-10-07", "textStart": 2341, "textEnd": 2350}], "sentiment": -0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Iranians still hold painful memories of the country's last extended conflict, an eight-year war with Iraq that decimated a generation, and for decades Tehran has preferred to harry its rivals in the region through a network of foreign militias.\n\nHezbollah, the Tehran-backed Lebanese group, also has more to lose from escalating its 10-month cross-border battle with Israel into a full-scale war. While Hezbollah has a missile arsenal that could punish Israel severely, its leaders have watched Israel demolish much of Gaza since the Oct. 7 attacks and pick off its leadership -- something Israel has vowed to replicate in Lebanon if provoked.\n\nBoth suffered major embarrassments recently that analysts say they will feel they must respond to. An Israeli airstrike last week killed one of Hezbollah's most senior commanders, in a suburb of Beirut. A day later, Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in his room while visiting Tehran for the inauguration of Iran's new president -- an attack that Iran and Hamas blame on Israel, which hasn't publicly commented on the killing.\n\nIran and Hezbollah will try to thread the needle between hitting targets of value without doing so much damage that they set off a war. At the same time, both Iran and Hezbollah are penetrated by Israeli intelligence.\n\n\"Neither Hezbollah nor Iran wants a comprehensive war now,\" said Ali Fadlallah, a Beirut-based independent political scientist familiar with Hezbollah's thinking. \"But at the same time they do not want the Israelis to conclude that their unwillingness to go to war allows them to cross red lines.\"\n\nWestern officials think Iran and Hezbollah will launch attacks against Israel in the coming days, but hope that a week of frenzied international diplomacy and new military deployments to the region have helped delay and possibly mitigate it.\n\nThe U.S. has warned Iran that its recently elected government and its economy could suffer a devastating blow if Tehran were to mount a major attack against Israel, a U.S. official said. Arab diplomats have passed along similar warnings to Iran and have sought to persuade it to climb down.\n\nIsrael has signaled its readiness to reply quickly to any strike and even pre-empt one if necessary. The Pentagon ordered additional missile defense-capable cruisers and destroyers, as well as more land-based missile-defense units and another fighter squadron to the Middle East, beefing up assets that already included a carrier strike group and additional warships.\n\nHezbollah and Arab officials say that Iran and its allies are still assessing whether Israel might use any Iranian-orchestrated attack as an excuse to strike back even harder -- and how far the U.S. is willing to go in its support of its ally.\n\nThe threat of war has sent a wave of concern through Middle East capitals. In Beirut, residents say they are more worried than they have been in years that current hostilities may spread beyond the country's south, which has been engulfed in cross-border fighting for 10 months.\n\nIn a speech this week, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said his group was certain to retaliate, but in its own time.\n\n\"Their government, their army, their society, their settlements and their occupiers are all waiting,\" Nasrallah said about Israel. The wait, he said, is \"part of the punishment.\"\n\n\"Two attacks broke the rules of engagement and crossed red lines. No country in the world would accept this attack,\" said Fadlallah, the Beirut-based political scientist.\n\nAt the same time, Hezbollah, which is also a powerful political party, has to appease its own domestic constituency, which is wary of war.\n\nThe last time Hezbollah fought a war with Israel, in 2006, many Lebanese rallied around the group. Arabs across the Middle East hailed it as the first nonstate movement to successfully square off with Israel. That won't happen now, said Sami Nader, director of the Institute of Political Science at Saint Joseph University in Beirut.\n\n\"The situation is totally different from the one in 2006. Lebanon has gone through economic collapse, people lost their savings in the banks, the currency lost 98% of its value, unemployment is high,\" Nader said. \"Hezbollah's constituency in the south lost their houses once. They don't want to do it a second time. The timing is not right for a war with Israel.\"\n\nWhile Iran has previously accused Israel of killing nuclear scientists on its soil, the killing of Haniyeh in Tehran was particularly embarrassing, exposing its inability to keep high-value friends secure.\n\n\"The location is more important than the target itself. You can't let your capital be so open to operations,\" said Joseph Bahout, director of the Issam Fares Institute for Public Policy and International Affairs at the American University of Beirut. \"They will have to reply.\"\n\nYet Iranian leaders face a crisis of legitimacy at home, where pressure builds from citizens fed up with arduous moral strictures and a continuing economic slump.\n\nNewly elected Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has promised to address both, calling for improving ties with the West and appointing officials with a record of reducing tensions. A war might put engagement with the West at risk.\n\nAs president, Pezeshkian presides over Iran's Supreme National Security Council, though key military decisions are dominated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and taken by the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nIran already faced off directly with Israel once this year. In April, a suspected Israeli airstrike struck an Iranian consulate building in Damascus, Syria, killing 16 people, including eight Revolutionary Guard officers. Iran responded two weeks later by launching more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel, an unprecedented show of force and the first time Tehran targeted Israel directly.\n\nBut Iran also telegraphed the attack through diplomatic channels, allowing Israel and a U.S.-led coalition to prepare for the strike and intercept almost all of the incoming missiles and drones. The result headed off significant escalation but was a failure for Iran.\n\nThis time, Iran is responding to a different sort of attack in the killing of the Hamas leader on its soil. Iran isn't expected to respond in kind, as it likely doesn't have the intelligence or the means to conduct targeted assassinations in Israel akin to the ones that took place in Beirut and Tehran.\n\nOne option available to Iran is to go at it alone, as it did in April, but that risks direct Israeli retaliation on Iranian soil. Another option is to orchestrate an attack on Israel through allied militias in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria -- possibly on several fronts simultaneously, though that increases the complexity.\n\nYemen's Houthi militia last month claimed responsibility for a drone strike in Tel Aviv that killed one person and wounded several others, a first for the group and evidence of the growing complications Israel faces.\n\n\"Since Oct. 7, Yemen has become a central front against Israel, and the drone in Tel Aviv shortened the distance to Israel,\" said Ali al-Mohatwary, a Beirut-based writer affiliated with the Houthi movement. \"We will only escalate in support of the Palestinian people.\"\n\nWar could carry a regional diplomatic cost as well for Tehran, which in recent years has improved relations with its Arab neighbors. Arab officials have also emphasized that the key to achieving peace in the region is for Israel to halt its offensive in Gaza.\n\nSome in Israel, including in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, have called for an operation in Lebanon to push Hezbollah away from the border and allow displaced families to return to their homes. Polls show that a majority of Israelis support such an operation. A serious attack by Hezbollah could give Israel the pretext to launch the operation.\n\nAt the same time, however, there is widespread concern among Israel's security establishment that opening another front would take an untenable toll on the military, which is stretched thin from fighting in Gaza and relies heavily on fatigued reservists. The Israeli military is also short on munitions, according to a recent court document.\n\nThe U.S. is on alert but doesn't believe Iran could conduct a much larger military campaign on Israel than it did in April, two U.S. officials said.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Beirut, like other Western diplomatic missions, hasn't evacuated its staff.\n\nSummer Said, Adam Chamseddine, Laurence Norman, Anat Peled, Dov Lieber, Benoit Faucon and Nancy A.

Israel has not claimed responsibility for Haniyeh's death but had previously threatened to eliminate the leadership of the Palestinian group.\n\nHezbollah could strike with little or no notice due to being Israel's direct neighbor to the north, one of CNN's sources claimed.\n\nTel Aviv has warned that if the Lebanese-based group harms Israeli civilians as part of its retaliation, the Israel Defense Force's response would be disproportionate, Axios reported on Wednesday, citing Israeli officials.\n\nAccording to a report in Politico, Iran may be reconsidering launching a large-scale attack on Israel. The Joe Biden administration has worked through diplomatic channels to discourage Tehran from a multi-pronged attack, highlighting a risk of a direct war between Iran and Israel, the outlet wrote on Thursday, citing senior US officials. It had been reported previously that Iran was expected to strike Israel on Monday.\n\nIn April, Iran fired hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel in response to the Israeli bombing of its consulate in Syria.\n\nTensions between Iran and Israel peaked after Hamas launched a surprise attack on the occupied territories on October 7. In response, the Zionist regime started an offensive in the Gaza Strip, causing unprecedented destruction in the Palestinian enclave. The war so far claimed the lives of nearly 40,000 Palestinians in the blockaded territory.", "source": {"uri": "ifpnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Iran Front Page"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_enclaves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian enclaves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blockade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Syria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://ifpnews.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=rank_math_overlay_thumb&id=322991&type=iran-front-page&hash=0963082498e2618d2a5949642f83db74", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799808", "eventUri": "eng-9799808", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-10-07", "textStart": 1775, "textEnd": 1784}], "sentiment": -0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Israel warned yesterday that it would eliminate the new leader of Hamas, Yahya Shinwar, after Israeli authorities accused him of being among the masterminds of the unprecedented raid on southern Israel in October that sparked this war.\n\nIsrael: We will find the new Hamas leader and destroy him\n\nAs all mediation efforts have failed so far, the war threatens to spread throughout the Middle East. Iran And its allies, and on the other hand Israel and its allies, especially the United States of America.\n\nAs the threat of war escalates, the international community is looking for ways to appease and resume indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas in order to reach a ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip, which will be accompanied by the release of Israeli hostages in the Gaza Strip in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons.\n\nDiplomatic contacts have increased, especially between the mediating countries in the indirect negotiations (Qatar, Egypt, the United States). The spokesman for the US National Security Council, John Kirby, said yesterday: \"We believe that we have never been this close\" to concluding a ceasefire agreement.", "source": {"uri": "thevalleypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Valley Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.naftemporiki.gr/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/hezbollah.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799808", "eventUri": "eng-9799808", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

One US military source said that Iran has made preparations, but not all of them, that the US expects to see ahead of a large attack on Israel. Considering Lebanon's proximity to Israel as its direct neighbor to the north, Hezbollah may act without prior notice, said a second source familiar with intelligence - which the assessment says is not true for Iran.\n\nMeanwhile, the Biden administration has actively employed diplomatic channels through its allies in the Middle East to press Tehran to reconsider advancing a military attack on Israel. They warned Iran that a massive attack would only increase tension and risk a direct confrontation between the two countries, said two senior US officials.\n\nThis comes as Iran has vowed to respond to the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, with reports indicating that his death was the result of a remotely controlled bomb placed in his guest house in Tehran as part of a covert operation, not part of a larger airstrike as was previously claimed. Now, Tehran is increasingly aligning with Washington's assessment, although it initially denied this, official sources said.\n\nUS officials forwarded messages to Tehran through various intermediaries that if the explosion that eliminated Haniyeh was the result of a covert Israeli operation and did not kill any Iranian citizens, then Iran needs to reassess its plan to launch a military attack on Israel.

He said the Israeli prime minister was seeking to set a trap.\n\nOn Wednesday, Netanyahu told soldiers during a visit to the Tel Hashomer army recruitment base that Israel was \"prepared for defence, as well as offence ... We are determined to defend ourselves.\"\n\nThe country is bracing itself for a response from Iran and from Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, whose military chief, Fuad Shukr, was killed in Beirut by Israel last week.\n\nHospitals in northern Israel and in Lebanon have been preparing for a potential influx of wounded people. Israel's home front command this week sent search-and-rescue battalions to major cities and large outdoor gatherings in northern Israel have been banned.\n\nSpeculation continued on Thursday about the degree to which Iran was seeking to coordinate its actions with Hezbollah, the powerful militia based in Lebanon. Israeli officials assess that Hezbollah is determined to carry out a retaliatory attack, which will come first, while Iran has still not decided how best to respond, several Israeli news outlets reported.\n\n\"The waiting is part of our response ... the battle is also psychological,\" Hezbollah's secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah, claimed in a speech earlier this week.\n\nIn an effort to revive a broader and credible diplomatic offensive against Israel, Malaysia while at the Jeddah meeting proposed that a revised emergency session of the UN general assembly be held and that attempts should be made to give effect to the advisory opinion by the international court of justice about Israel's settlement policy.\n\nAt a side meeting between the Jordanian foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, and the acting Iranian foreign minister, Ali Bagheri, in Jeddah, the second one in a matter of days, Jordan insisted it will shoot down Iranian missiles or drones if they enter Jordanian airspace en route to Israel.\n\nHe told CNN: \"Our message has been clear to the Iranians, to the Israelis that we will not be a battleground for anybody. We will not allow anybody to the extent that we can to violate our airspace. Our first responsibility is towards our people, protecting the sovereignty of our country and the safety of our people. So our position is that nobody should use our airspace, nobody should subject our people to the threat of any projectile falling over any of our territory and harming our people and that is a position that we've communicated to both the Iranians and the Israelis in very unequivocal terms.\"\n\nBagheri in an interview with AFP accused Israel - which has not commented on the death of Haniyeh - of wanting to \"expand the war\" in the region, while judging that it has \"neither the capacity nor the strength\" to fight Iran.\n\nReformist Iranian press covered claims that an Iranian decision to refrain from a revenge attack would increase Iran's prestige in the region, intensify Israel's isolation and even mean Iran is credited for bringing peace.\n\nRelated: US and UK expected to be drawn in as Iran prepares retaliation against Israel\n\nThe US said it was sending messages to Iran that an attack would be counterproductive and claimed it has reassembled the military alliance to defend Israel that operated in April during the last conflict between Iran and Israel.\n\nThe US is also telling Iran that Israel and Hamas may be close to a ceasefire agreement but the explicit evidence for this remains slim, and has been dangled in front of regional states before only for an agreement to prove elusive.\n\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, has for a second time called the new Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, to urge him and the Israeli prime minister not to become involved in a cycle of violence.\n\nHowever, Pezeshkian insisted Iran \"will never remain silent in the face of aggression against its interests and security\".\n\nRelated: Hamas's leader is dead, Iran vows revenge: can anything stop all-out war in the Middle East?\n\nHe told Macron that western countries should do more to pressure Israel. \"If the United States and the western countries are truly seeking to prevent war in the region, they must force this regime [Israel] to stop the genocide and attacks on Gaza and accept a ceasefire,\" Pezeshkian said.\n\nA similar de-escalatory message has been sent to Bagheri by the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy.\n\nIran is angered that the UK, France and the US have not been willing to condemn the assassination, and Iranian diplomats do not see any evidence that Israel will make any new concessions on a ceasefire agreement. Iran also argues that the inability of the UN security council collectively to condemn the assassination means Iran has been left with no alternative but to take unilateral military steps.\n\nBut as the time between the assassination and an Iranian response nears a fortnight, officials are increasingly briefing Iran has no intention of provoking a regional war or causing mass civilian casualties inside Israel.\n\nIran is also distracted by the completion of the final stages of forming a new cabinet that will be put to parliament for affirmation probably on Sunday. Pezeshkian is stressing he is seeking to form a government of national unity and not just a reformist faction-led administration, It is expected that Abbas Araghchi, a former deputy foreign minister, will replace Bagheri.\n\nThe new government is grappling with public anger over the release of a video showing two teenage girls being arrested and struck by members of the morality police. The incident happened in Tehran before the election of the new government, but Pezeshkian has called for the episode to be investigated. There has also been a spate of executions.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Seven U.S. personnel were injured in the attack.\n\nThis heightened military posture comes amid rising tensions as Iran threatens retaliation against Israel for the recent assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.

When will Iran attack Israel? These questions have been in speculation ever since Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran on July 31. Now, all eyes are on the August 15 ceasefire talks read more\n\nThe assassination of Hamas's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran has significantly heightened tensions in West Asia, with fears of a regional war looming large. Iran, which has vowed revenge for Haniyeh's killing, is now at a crossroads -- whether to launch a retaliatory attack on Israel or to opt for a Gaza ceasefire as a diplomatic alternative.\n\nDiplomatic manoeuvres amid regional war concerns\n\nAt the recent emergency summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, regional leaders expressed hopes that Iran might lean towards diplomacy rather than military action.\n\nIran's Acting Foreign Minister, Ali Bagheri, alongside other Muslim-majority country representatives, discussed possible steps to prevent further escalation. Jordan's Foreign Minister, Ayman Safadi, emphasised that ending the ongoing Israeli aggression in Gaza is the first step towards de-escalation, urging all parties to consider the broader consequences of continued violence.\n\nThere is a ceasefire proposal\n\nUnited States Secretary of State Antony Blinken indicated that ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas had reached a crucial stage, with both sides warned against further escalation. France's President Emmanuel Macron also weighed in, urging Iran to abandon any plans for retaliation against Israel, suggesting that a Gaza ceasefire could serve as a diplomatic win for Tehran.\n\nSuch a move would allow Iran to project itself as a protector of Palestinian lives while avoiding the potential pitfalls of a direct military confrontation with Israel.\n\nOn its part, Israel has agreed to join the ceasefire talks with Hamas on August 15. This raises hope that West Asia may finally see easing out of tensions after 10 months of Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. It has also witnessed exchange of fire and casualties along Israel-Lebanon border, with Iran-backed Hezbollah targeting Israel, which responds prompting with greater force each time it faces a missile or rocket attack.\n\nThe Hezbollah factor\n\nThe assassination of Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah's military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut has further complicated the situation. There are concerns that Hezbollah, Iran's Lebanese proxy, may act independently to avenge Shukr's death, potentially dragging Iran into a broader conflict. Israeli officials are reportedly bracing for such an attack, though it remains uncertain how closely coordinated Hezbollah's actions might be with Tehran.\n\nIran has its own strategic dilemma\n\nIran faces a complex strategic decision. On one hand, a retaliatory strike against Israel could satisfy the calls for vengeance from within the country and among its allies.\n\nOn the other hand, diplomatic pressure, particularly from the United States and its allies, suggests that restraint could yield greater long-term benefits for Iran.\n\nTehran's leaders are reportedly contemplating a more targeted response, possibly against Mossad or Israeli military assets, rather than a broader assault that could result in mass civilian casualties.\n\nExternal actors and internal factors\n\nJordan has made its stance clear, with Safadi warning that Jordan would not tolerate any violation of its airspace by Iranian missiles or drones. Meanwhile, the US and its allies have continued to pressure Iran to refrain from military action, with messages indicating that an attack would be counterproductive.\n\nThe involvement of international players like France and the UK in de-escalatory efforts further complicates Iran's decision-making process. Within Iran, the debate over how to respond is influenced by both internal and external pressures.\n\nSome factions argue that refraining from a revenge attack could enhance Iran's prestige and increase Israel's isolation in the region. However, others point to the failure of the UN Security Council to condemn Haniyeh's assassination as justification for unilateral military action.\n\nIran's new President Masoud Pezeshkian has also been under pressure, adding another layer of complexity to Tehran's potential response. The government's focus on domestic issues, such as public outcry over recent incidents involving the \"morality police,\" may also impact its decision-making.\n\nSo, what future holds: Diplomacy or retaliation?", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person",

At the same time, however, the rising number of firefights and casualties, and the mutual buildup of forces, threatened to do the opposite: create a major war which, as in 2002, caused huge losses for all sides.\n\nNow, two weeks later, the stakes for all sides are much higher. A Hezbollah rocket attack killed 12 children in a village in the Golan Heights, and Israel's response -- an air assault on Beirut that killed Fuad Shukr, a senior Hezbollah commander -- raised the stakes. At virtually the same time, Israel also carried out the assassination in Tehran of Ismail Haniyeh, a key figure in the Hamas leadership.\n\nOnce again, the threat of a wider war looms, and the leaders in Israel, Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran must reconsider whether these escalations should continue. In short, for each of them the strategic question is: Should we continue with tit-for-tat actions, accept our losses and continue negotiating a cease-fire, or escalate to repay blood debts?\n\nEmbedded in these choices are certain military and political realities, described in detail by Dexter Filkins in the July 29 issue of The New Yorker. If Israel attacks Hezbollah's huge missile and rocket force, estimated at around 150,000, it would probably not be able to destroy it completely.\n\nThat would probably require Israel to follow up with a ground invasion. Hezbollah, meantime, could fire thousands of missiles a day into Israel, causing huge losses of life and property. But Israeli strikes would also cause enormous losses for Hezbollah, and an invasion might well destroy much of Lebanon itself. Iran would have to weigh how to support Hezbollah, at the great risk of a showdown with the US, which just now is bolstering its Middle East air and naval presence just to head off that possibility.\n\nVengeance: A Common Motive\n\nAll the parties thus have reason to fear a wider war, and have said as much. Yet the desire for vengeance runs deep. Israel's government conveyed a wish to avoid a larger war, but also said the assassinations were necessary to repay for the killing of children.\n\nHezbollah and Iran also lean toward retribution. Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's leader, declared at the funeral of Fuad Shukr: \"The enemy, and those who are behind the enemy, must await our inevitable response ... You do not know what red lines you crossed.\"\n\nIran's supreme leader, Ali Khameini, is said to have ordered an attack on Israel, which most likely would come from Hezbollah but could be directly from Tehran. Observers recall that the last time Iran responded to an Israeli attack, in April, which killed several senior Revolutionary Guards at the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria, Iran made its first-ever direct attack on Israel.\n\nThe trouble with all these options for using greater force is that, when you step back and analyze them, their necessity and motives are questionable. Did Israel carry out the assassinations at that particular moment in order to squelch progress in the cease-fire talks and sustain the far right's social and political agenda?\n\nSteven Erlanger raised that issue in the New York Times of August 2. So did an Israeli writer for Ha'aretz, who wondered if Netanyahu was \"deliberately provoking escalation in the hope that a conflagration with Iran will drag the United States into the conflict, further distancing [him] from the debacle of October 7 . . .\"\n\nThe same question can also be asked of Hezbollah and Iran: Is a major retaliation against Israel necessary at this time, with the high risk of sparking a war that might bring in the US? Is the Hezbollah strategy, dictated by Iran and supported by Hamas, to keep the pot boiling in order to provoke further US and international distancing from Israel?\n\nEscalation and Miscalculation\n\nWhat kind of retaliation any of these parties will make against Israel, and how Israel might respond, may not be known for a while. But one thing all the parties should consider but may ignore: They cannot fully control an escalation.\n\nIt's a phenomenon familiar to students of war: actions taken defensively by one side, with the aim of deterring the other side from further attacks, are interpreted by the other side to be more threatening, leading to further escalation in response. A former US ambassador to Israel, Thomas R. Nides, put it well:\n\n\"Neither side really wants a bigger war because they understand the huge damage that it would cause their countries. The problem is that wars are caused by miscalculations. And by trying to deter each other from escalating, they risk making a miscalculation that does the opposite of what they intended.\"\n\nAt bottom, none of the contending parties seems to want either war or peace.

Mr Shine is a former officer in Mossad, the Israeli security agency, and the head of the Iran program at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv.\n\nHezbollah is \"more committed\" to attack, Mr Shine said, as \"Nasrallah personally feels obliged to his friend and colleague for so many years\".\n\nThe news that Hezbollah might attack Israel independently and ahead of Iran was first reported on Thursday by CNN, which said its sources were familiar with the intelligence.\n\nOne US military official told the channel that Iran had made some of the preparations needed to launch an assault - but not all of them.\n\nA second source said Hezbollah could act with little or no notice, given the short distance between its missile launchers and Israel.\n\nBoth Hezbollah and Iran have said they will retaliate for the killings - but not how.\n\nHaniyeh, the leader of the Hamas terror group, was assassinated in Tehran as he visited for the inauguration of Iran's new president. Hezbollah, of which Shukr was a founding member, is an Iranian proxy group.\n\nWhile any further response Hezbollah makes to the death of Shukr is likely to be co-ordinated with Tehran, the terror group is still capable of acting independently at times, analysts noted.\n\nNasrallah said in a speech on Tuesday that the ambiguity around its response was part of \"the punishment\" for Israel, which has seen hundreds of international flights cancelled and a marked downturn in social and economic activity.\n\n\"The little anxieties pool together like beads of water on a tabletop,\" said Linda Dayan, a journalist with the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, of the mood in the country on Thursday.\n\nIran has said it will retaliate \"at the right time\" but officials have also stressed it is not seeking to escalate matters to a full-scale war.\n\nIn April, it launched more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel a full two weeks after an Israeli strike on its embassy in Damascus.\n\n\"How Iran and the resistance front will respond is currently being reviewed... This will certainly happen and the Zionist regime [Israel] will undoubtedly regret it,\" General Mohammad Baqeri, Iran's armed forces chief of staff, told state TV on Thursday.\n\nThe country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is a hard-line Islamist but has long embraced a policy of political expediency or \"heroic flexibility\" when it comes to international relations.\n\nOn Thursday, US officials indicated Iran was once again telegraphing its intentions ahead of time, giving the US time to to manoeuvre defensive military assets including aircraft carriers into position.\n\n\"Iran understands clearly that the US is unwavering in its defence of our interests, our partners and our people. We have moved a significant amount of military assets to the region to underscore that principle,\" a senior Biden administration official told the Washington Post.\n\nIn recent years, Iran has developed important diplomatic and trading relationships with China, Russia and Saudi Arabia in a bid to counter US and Israeli influence in the region and has much to lose if it calibrates its response poorly.\n\nSome analysts believe that despite tactical military wins, including the recent assassinations, Israel is losing the strategic battle in the region and that Iran does not want to disrupt that trajectory.\n\nThis view is rejected by many in the Israeli defence establishment and the country's political Right.\n\n\"They want our blood and their honour back,\" said Assaf Orion, a retired Israeli brigadier general and a fellow of the The Washington Institute, of the likely response to the killings.\n\n\"By desert rules, if you can't protect your guests, you're good game\".",

He said the Israeli prime minister was seeking to set a trap.\n\nOn Wednesday, Netanyahu told soldiers during a visit to the Tel Hashomer army recruitment base that Israel was \"prepared for defence, as well as offence ... We are determined to defend ourselves.\"\n\nThe country is bracing itself for a response from Iran and from Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, whose military chief, Fuad Shukr, was killed in Beirut by Israel last week.\n\nHospitals in northern Israel and in Lebanon have been preparing for a potential influx of wounded people. Israel's home front command this week sent search-and-rescue battalions to major cities and large outdoor gatherings in northern Israel have been banned.\n\nSpeculation continued on Thursday about the degree to which Iran was seeking to coordinate its actions with Hezbollah, the powerful militia based in Lebanon. Israeli officials assess that Hezbollah is determined to carry out a retaliatory attack, which will come first, while Iran has still not decided how best to respond, several Israeli news outlets reported.\n\n\"The waiting is part of our response ... the battle is also psychological,\" Hezbollah's secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah, claimed in a speech earlier this week.\n\nIn an effort to revive a broader and credible diplomatic offensive against Israel, Malaysia while at the Jeddah meeting proposed that a revised emergency session of the UN general assembly be held and that attempts should be made to give effect to the advisory opinion by the international court of justice about Israel's settlement policy.\n\nAt a side meeting between the Jordanian foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, and the acting Iranian foreign minister, Ali Bagheri, in Jeddah, the second one in a matter of days, Jordan insisted it will shoot down Iranian missiles or drones if they enter Jordanian airspace en route to Israel.\n\nHe told CNN: \"Our message has been clear to the Iranians, to the Israelis that we will not be a battleground for anybody. We will not allow anybody to the extent that we can to violate our airspace. Our first responsibility is towards our people, protecting the sovereignty of our country and the safety of our people. So our position is that nobody should use our airspace, nobody should subject our people to the threat of any projectile falling over any of our territory and harming our people and that is a position that we've communicated to both the Iranians and the Israelis in very unequivocal terms.\"\n\nBagheri in an interview with AFP accused Israel - which has not commented on the death of Haniyeh - of wanting to \"expand the war\" in the region, while judging that it has \"neither the capacity nor the strength\" to fight Iran.\n\nReformist Iranian press covered claims that an Iranian decision to refrain from a revenge attack would increase Iran's prestige in the region, intensify Israel's isolation and even mean Iran is credited for bringing peace.\n\nThe US said it was sending messages to Iran that an attack would be counterproductive and claimed it has reassembled the military alliance to defend Israel that operated in April during the last conflict between Iran and Israel.\n\nThe US is also telling Iran that Israel and Hamas may be close to a ceasefire agreement but the explicit evidence for this remains slim, and has been dangled in front of regional states before only for an agreement to prove elusive.\n\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, has for a second time called the new Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, to urge him and the Israeli prime minister not to become involved in a cycle of violence.\n\nHowever, Pezeshkian insisted Iran \"will never remain silent in the face of aggression against its interests and security\".\n\nHe told Macron that western countries should do more to pressure Israel. \"If the United States and the western countries are truly seeking to prevent war in the region, they must force this regime [Israel] to stop the genocide and attacks on Gaza and accept a ceasefire,\" Pezeshkian said.\n\nA similar de-escalatory message has been sent to Bagheri by the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy.\n\nIran is angered that the UK, France and the US have not been willing to condemn the assassination, and Iranian diplomats do not see any evidence that Israel will make any new concessions on a ceasefire agreement. Iran also argues that the inability of the UN security council collectively to condemn the assassination means Iran has been left with no alternative but to take unilateral military steps.\n\nBut as the time between the assassination and an Iranian response nears a fortnight, officials are increasingly briefing Iran has no intention of provoking a regional war or causing mass civilian casualties inside Israel.\n\nIran is also distracted by the completion of the final stages of forming a new cabinet that will be put to parliament for affirmation probably on Sunday. Pezeshkian is stressing he is seeking to form a government of national unity and not just a reformist faction-led administration, It is expected that Abbas Araghchi, a former deputy foreign minister, will replace Bagheri.\n\nThe new government is grappling with public anger over the release of a video showing two teenage girls being arrested and struck by members of the morality police. The incident happened in Tehran before the election of the new government, but Pezeshkian has called for the episode to be investigated. There has also been a spate of executions.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "patrick_wintour@theguardian.com", "name": "Patrick

Soon after, Ayatollah Ali Khameini vowed \"harsh punishment\" against Israel, declaring it his \"duty\" to \"avenge\" the martyr's blood.\n\nYet at least so far, nothing has happened. There's a simmering tension between conflicting pressures -- at once political, diplomatic, pragmatic, and ideological -- to escalate the conflict or to cool it down.\n\nIt is a widely held view that Iran has to take some action in response. The killing took place on Iranian territory. Haniyeh had just attended the inauguration of Iran's new president, as had leaders from Iran's other allies -- members of the \"axis of resistance\" -- who must have wondered, in the wake of the attack, how capable Tehran would be at protecting them.\n\nU.S. diplomats have called all their intermediaries with Tehran, urging that the ayatollah -- the country's real decisionmaker (he isn't called the Supreme Leader for nothing) -- keep any armed response restricted to military targets, not many, and to avoid killing Israeli citizens.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned that if Iran did kill any civilians, he would strike back \"disproportionately.\" Some have hinted that Israel would respond by destroying Iran's nuclear facility -- a mission Israeli missiles and fighter jets have the range and firepower to accomplish and that, in fact, its crews have rehearsed.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's national security spokesman, John Kirby, has said that the United States would help defend Israel from any Iranian attack. In April, U.S., British, French, and Jordanian air-defense crews helped Israel repel a massive, multipronged Iranian attack -- consisting of more than 300 missiles and drones, including 110 ballistic missiles -- shooting down almost all of the projectiles that didn't crash along the way.\n\nHowever, there are a few new wrinkles in this buildup to a possible attack. On the one hand, Jordan's leaders, who were heavily criticized by their Palestinian citizens for helping out Israel four months ago, say that if Iran mounts an attack this time, they won't allow Israel or its defenders to use Jordanian air space -- meaning Iran's missiles and drones would have to be intercepted over Israeli territory, making it much harder to shoot down all of them.\n\nOn the other hand, Iran International, a U.K.-based news agency, reported that the new Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, asked Khameini to refrain from attacking Israel, warning that an Israeli counterstrike could have dire economic consequences for Iran.\n\nThis news agency is of uneven reliability, so who knows if the story is true. However, the new president, who is a surgeon and former reformist politician, is relatively moderate. He ran for office, and won, on a platform of reengaging with the West. He has appointed Mohammad Javad Zarif, who was foreign minister when Iran signed the nuclear deal with the U.S. and five other Western nations, as his vice president for strategic affairs. He has also named Ali Bagheri Kani, Iran's chief negotiator on the nuclear deal, as his foreign minister.\n\nIn other words, whether or not the Iran International story is true, it is plausible that the new president would be lobbying for a light response to Israel's killing. It is now clear, though, how much influence he has over the Supreme Leader.\n\nAnother report (again of unknown reliability) suggests that Iran might respond with moderation, if at all, because it is now clear -- this part is absolutely certain -- that Haniyeh was killed by a remote-control bomb that was placed under the bed in the guesthouse where he usually stays at least two months ago by an officer with the Revolutionary Guard Corps -- Iran's elite service -- who had been recruited by Israel's Mossad. In other words, Iran's own lax security was partly responsible for the assassination.\n\nFinally, there is another angle to consider: Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia that controls southern Lebanon, might go rogue. The group and Israeli forces have lobbed rockets back and forth for many years. The lobbing intensified, in frequency and explosive power, after Hamas' murderous invasion of Israel on Oct. 7 and the ensuing war in Gaza. (Many have speculated that Hamas' leaders expected Hezbollah to join in, attacking Israel from the north as they assaulted from the south. They were overly optimistic.) Last month, a Hezbollah rocket hit a soccer field in the Israel-controlled Golan Heights, killing 12 children. Israel retaliated with an airstrike in Beirut, killing Fouad Shukur, Hezbollah's top military commander. (This occurred just hours before the assassination of the Hamas chief in Tehran. Few voiced outrage over the former; many, including Israeli officers, feared the latter might have crossed some line of provocation.)\n\nWith all this in mind, some -- in the U.S., Israel, elsewhere in the Middle East, possibly even in Iran -- worry that Hezbollah might step up its rocket attacks on its own, without authorization from the mullahs in Tehran.\n\nMeanwhile, the fact that Iran hasn't struck back eight days after Haniyeh's killing is not necessarily a sign of restraint. Iran's massive missile and drone strike against Israel earlier this year took place on April 13. That was 12 days after an Israeli airstrike on Iran's consulate in Syria that killed seven senior officers of the Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nIt could be the Iranians are still plotting their next move. And so, we all wait.", "source": {"uri": "slate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slate Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fred_kaplan@slate.com", "name": "Fred Kaplan", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Diplomats across the Middle East and elsewhere have tried to tamp down the tensions amid fears that the Israel-Hamas war raging in the Gaza Strip could broaden into a much bigger conflict across the region.\n\nIntelligence has been sparse and changes frequently. But two Israeli officials and a senior Western intelligence official said that based on the latest information, Hezbollah, the Lebanese armed group closely allied with Iran, will likely strike first in a separate attack before Iran conducts its own retaliation. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly, and did not provide further details about the potential attacks.\n\nThe latest crisis follows the assassinations last week of Fouad Shukur, a top Hezbollah military commander, and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' political leader. Israel has said it killed Mr Shukur in retaliation for a rocket attack from Lebanon that killed 12 children and teenagers, while refusing to comment on the blast that killed Mr Haniyeh in Iran, which has been widely attributed to Israel.\n\nIran has vowed revenge for the killing of Mr Haniyeh on its soil, calling it an egregious violation of Iranian sovereignty. Mr Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's leader, said in an address this week that the group's response to the killing of Mr Shukur would be severe.\n\n\"Let the enemy, and those who stand behind them, await our inevitable response,\" said Mr Nasrallah. \"We are looking for a true response, not a superficial one,\" he added.\n\nFor the past 10 months, a low-grade war has been underway along the Israel-Lebanon border that began when Hezbollah - like Hamas an ally of Iran's - opened fire on Israel a day after the Hamas-led attack that set off the war in Gaza on Oct 7.

It fired roughly 300 ballistic missiles and drones at Israel, which intercepted most of the munitions with help from the United States and its allies.\n\nIsraeli officials say they are ready for any potential attack by Iran and its proxies. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told soldiers that Israel was \"prepared for defense, as well as offense.\"\n\n\"We are striking our enemies and determined to defend ourselves,\" he said.\n\nMilitary analysts say, however, that Israel is better prepared for some scenarios than for others.\n\nSince the 1990s, Israel has built a vaunted defense apparatus to protect its citizens from aerial attack. Aided by billions in American aid, the country invested in advanced antimissile systems, while requiring that reinforced bomb shelters be built in houses and apartment buildings.\n\nBut Iran and Hezbollah could fire enough munitions at once to overwhelm Israel's defenses. In addition, they can launch swarms of drones, which fly at low altitudes on unpredictable trajectories and leave little radar signature, making them more difficult than rockets and missiles to track and destroy.\n\nIn April, the United States and Israel assembled a coalition that worked with Britain, France and Jordan, among others, to intercept Iranian missiles and drones before they reached Israeli territory. It was unclear whether there would be as much international cooperation this time around.\n\nLast week, the United States said it had ordered more combat aircraft and warships capable of shooting down missiles and drones to the Middle East in response to the threats from Iran and its allies.\n\nThe assassinations of Mr. Shukr and Mr. Haniyeh have disrupted cease-fire talks for the war in Gaza that appeared to be gathering momentum in July.\n\nMr. Haniyeh was one of the leading Hamas figures in the cease-fire negotiations. His replacement as the group's political chief, Yahya Sinwar, Hamas's leader in Gaza and an architect of the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks, is a hard-liner who has long wielded a decisive veto on any cease-fire proposal due to his control on the ground in the enclave, according to U.S. and Israeli officials. He is believed to be hiding in tunnels in Gaza.\n\nTwo Hamas officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that Hamas's point man in the indirect cease-fire talks with Israel, Khalil al-Hayya, would continue in his role meeting with Qatari and Egyptian mediators, and transmitting the group's positions.\n\nMr. al-Hayya, a longtime resident of Gaza, left the territory before Oct. 7 and has spent much of his time in Doha, Qatar, and in Istanbul. While Mr. Hayya has served as the head of Hamas's negotiating team, other officials in the group have taken part in the talks and Hamas could include others besides Mr. Hayya in future negotiations.\n\nIsraeli bombardment of Gaza continued on Thursday, with Israel's military saying it had attacked two school compounds -- no longer in use as schools -- striking what it said were \"command and control centers\" for Hamas in eastern Gaza City. Palestinian Civil Defense, an arm of the Hamas-run government of Gaza, said the strikes killed 16 people and others were still missing beneath the rubble. Overall, the Gazan authorities say almost 40,000 have been confirmed killed in the war.\n\nOn Thursday, the military ordered the evacuation of a large area in and around Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, a day after telling people living in parts of northern Gaza to flee southward. Such orders are usually preludes to Israeli attacks. The actions continue the pattern of recent months in which the military strikes areas that were already cleared and decimated earlier in the war, saying that Hamas had regrouped there and fired on Israel or its troops.\n\nThe evacuations also continue a cycle of displacement for civilians who have fled the fighting multiple times, many of them living in overcrowded tent camps and shelters.\n\nSuzan Abu Daqqa, 59, fled her house in Abasan al-Kabira, a suburb of Khan Younis, for at least the third time, joining the tide of people seeking to escape the feared Israeli advance. The last time Israel ordered an evacuation, she stayed in her home with her elderly relatives, hoping the Israeli offensive would not reach them. This time, a shell exploded near her house, so they left.\n\n\"There were displaced people everywhere, walking on their feet, from Abasan all the way to Khan Younis,\" she said.\n\nThe United Nations says the humanitarian situation remains desperate in Gaza, and Britain and the European Union this week condemned Bezalel Smotrich, the far-right Israeli finance minister, for saying that it \"might be justified\" to starve two million civilians in Gaza until the hostages held there are returned. Mr. Smotrich has a strong influence over policy as the leader of a party that helps keep Mr. Netanyahu's coalition government in power.\n\n\"Deliberate starvation of civilians is a war crime: Minister Smotrich advocating for it is beyond ignominious,\" the E.U.'s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell Fontelles, said in a post on social media on Wednesdays. The British foreign secretary, David Lammy, called on the Israeli government to \"retract and condemn\" the remarks.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors":

Some claim it is already set to be unleashed on the Jewish day of mourning, Tisha b'Av, that falls this year beginning on the night of August 12 and lasts until the next day, August 13. Or it could come as soon as Monday. These proxies include what remains of Hamas as a fighting force in Gaza, the Houthis in Yemen, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas terrorists in the West Bank, and by far the most threatening of Iran's proxies, Hezbollah in Lebanon, which is estimated to now possess 200,000 rockets and missiles.\n\nMore on this latest report from the Institute for the Study of War can be found here: \"Iran attack scenarios (ISW),\" Elder of Ziyon, August 2, 2024:\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War has the best dispassionate analysis of the current war, which from the start they always identified as Iran (not Hamas) against Israel.\n\nAs it appears that Iran is readying a major attack on Israel, it is worth reading their analysis, and subscribing to their daily reports.\n\nHere is their report from yesterday on the threat:\n\nIran and the Axis of Resistance are messaging that they will conduct a coordinated, large-scale attack on Israel in retaliation for Israel killing several Axis of Resistance leaders, including Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Haniyeh, in recent days. Senior Iranian security officials, including Armed Forces General Staff Chief Major General Mohammad Bagheri and Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Akbar Ahmadian, suggested that both Iran and the Axis of Resistance will retaliate against Israel.[1] Iranian leaders met with senior Axis of Resistance officials, many of whom were already in Tehran for the inauguration of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, to coordinate their combined attack.[2] Iranian state media has furthermore suggested that the upcoming Iranian-led attack on Israel would be similar to but greater than the drone and missile attack that Iran launched on Israel in April 2024.[3]\n\nIran and the Axis of Resistance are almost certainly considering how to cause greater damage to Israel than the April 2024 attack did since that attack failed to impose a serious cost on Israel and thus failed to deter. Iran and its allies fired around 170 one-way attack drones, 30 cruise missiles, and 120 ballistic missiles at Israel in the April 2024 attack.[4] Iran designed this strike package of over 300 projectiles to inflict serious damage on Israel. Iran specifically targeted two remote Israeli targets -- an airbase in the southern Israeli desert and an intelligence center in the Golan Heights.[5] Lebanese Hezbollah fired dozens of rockets, while the Houthis launched a few drones and missiles in the April 2024 attack.[6] Iran modeled its attack on Russian strike packages used in Ukraine.[7] Iran has observed how Russian forces have combined drones and missiles in attacks on Ukrainian targets and likely concluded that it could similarly use such a strike package to overwhelm Israeli air defenses and get some projectiles to strike their targets as CTP-ISW has previously assessed.[8]\n\nBut the United States, Israel, and their allies intercepted the vast majority of the projectiles, so that the Iranian attack did significantly less damage than Tehran intended.[9] The United States and Israel benefitted from the fact that the Iranian attack drones took hours to fly from Iran to Israel across nearly a thousand kilometers. That hours-long period gave the United States, Israel, and their allies time to prepare their defenses and intercept all the drones as well as many of the subsequent ballistic and cruise missiles. Iranian leaders likely calculate that they failed to deter Israel with their April 2024 attack because they did not inflict serious damage.\n\nIran is likely now planning for its next attack in order to establish deterrence with Israel while still avoiding a large-scale war. One of the most dangerous but increasingly likely scenarios is that Iran and the Axis of Resistance launch a combined, large-scale drone and missile attack that incorporates lessons from the April 2024 attack. Iranian leaders, in this scenario, could increase the volume of projectiles fired at Israel by launching more from Iran, from the surrounding countries, or both. Hezbollah, the Houthis, and Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria could launch simultaneous attacks to further strain Israeli air defenses as well. Drones and missiles launched from Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria would be much harder to intercept than the ones from Iran given the shorter distances and flight times to Israel. US and Israeli forces would have significantly less time to intercept those projectiles. It would take Hezbollah drones around 15 minutes to reach Haifa and around 40 minutes flying on direct paths to reach Tel Aviv, for instance (although many drones will likely fly indirect and longer routes).[10] Iran could alternatively exploit the short flight times to concentrate a smaller volume of fire against a single target in Israel rather than against two. Shorter flight times for the drones could make it easier to coordinate them with ballistic missiles fired from Iran, whose flight times are generally less than 10 minutes. If Iran and its partners and proxies can concentrate drones and missiles on Israeli targets simultaneously, they may have reason to expect that the distractions caused by the one can facilitate penetration by the other.\n\nIran and the Axis of Resistance will also benefit from the fact that they have probed Israeli air defenses extensively since April 2024 and thus learned how to attack them more effectively. Hezbollah and the Houthis have both conducted attacks that have successfully bypassed Israeli air defenses since April 2024. The most notable example was the Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv on July 19 that killed an Israeli and injured four others.[11] Israeli air defenses have similarly struggled to intercept Hezbollah drones in recent months because of the short flight time and mountainous terrain.[12] The success that Israel and its allies and partners had in defeating the April 2024 strike should not be cause for complacency in the face of a new attack. But Israel and its supporters have multiple systems to engage various kinds of targets and are aware of the capabilities Hezbollah's drones have shown, so neither is there cause for pessimism.\n\nIran could inadvertently trigger an expanded conflict with Israel and even the United States if Iran launches an attack along the lines described here. Launching hundreds of projectiles is inherently risky, particularly given the failure rate that Iranian missiles have shown.[13] Technical errors could cause severe collateral damage, as demonstrated by the recent Hezbollah attack that killed 12 Israeli children in the Golan Heights.[14] This risk is higher given reports that Iran is planning to target locations near Haifa and Tel Aviv.[15] Both cities are far more populated than the two remote locations that Iran targeted in April 2024. The risk of civilian casualties is thus very high even if Iran does not mean to strike civilian targets around Haifa and Tel Aviv. Iran could trigger an expanded war if it kills Israeli civilians or inflicts severe damage -- regardless of whether Iran intends to avoid an overt war. It may not be immediately obvious to Israeli leaders that a large strike aimed at one or two targets is not, in fact, aimed at a much wider target set, moreover. Drones have long ranges and often fly far beyond their targets before turning to hit them from the rear. The risk of miscalculation in a strike such as the one described is very high.\n\nSome Iranian officials and state media have called for targeting Israeli political and military leaders in response to Haniyeh's death. Martyrs and Veterans Affairs Foundation President Amir Hossein Ghazi Zadeh Hashemi called on August 1 for killing one of Israel's \"main\" leaders.[16] IRGC-affiliated media similarly argued on August 1 that \"every [Israeli] political and military official will be a potential target.\"[17]...\n\nThat is where things now stand. The Bidenites claim that Israel's assassinations represent an \"escalation\" in the violence and make the hostage deal more unlikely. Others, including Professor John Spencer of West Point and Arsen Ostrovsky, believe that those killings, carried out in such spectacular fashion, with Shukr killed in the Hezbollah heartland of south Beirut, from an airstrike, and Haniyeh killed in a Tehran guesthouse, from a bomb that had been planted in the room he was going to stay in, some two months before, have done much to restore the deterrent power of the Jewish state. Others believe these assassinations have so enraged the Iranians that they will try, with the help of their proxies in the region, to launch a multi-pronged attack on Israel. The date often mentioned for that attack is August 12, when the Jewish day of mourning on Tisha b'Av takes place. We'll soon see if Israeli deterrence holds, and Hezbollah contents itself with lobbying a few dozen missiles into northern Israel, or whether a massive, coordinated assault on Israel by Iran, Hezbollah, and others proves that Israeli deterrence has failed. I'm betting that the Supreme Leader will in the end decide that he would, after all, not want to take his chances. and quite sensibly prefers to stay alive.", "source": {"uri": "frontpagemag.com",

Is it ready for the next one?", "body": "Sorry, a summary is not available for this article at this time. Please try again later.\n\nTEL AVIV -- As Israel braces for an attack from Iran -- fueling fighter jets, positioning air defense batteries and coordinating with Washington on the placement of U.S. military assets -- there is growing apprehension about one of its most critical lines of defense: an American-led Arab coalition that helped thwart the last Iranian assault.\n\nThe once covert alliance, involving Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, burst into public view on the night of April 13, when it aided Israel in intercepting 99 percent of more than 300 drones and missiles launched from Iran -- the first direct of strike its kind by Tehran after decades of shadow war with the Jewish state.\n\nIsrael's military chief lauded the collaboration at the time as paving the way for \"new opportunities for cooperation in the Middle East.\" White House national security adviser John Kirby said it sent \"a strong message about where Israel is in the region versus where Iran is in the region.\"\n\nFour months later, with Iran vowing to respond forcefully to the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in its own backyard, Israel is more regionally isolated, which military analysts say could make the country more vulnerable. There are also fears that, even with American support, Israel's aerial defense systems may not be able to fully counter a massive, coordinated attack.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refused to agree to a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza, despite pressure from Washington and appeals from his own military chiefs. The killing of Haniyeh -- the lead Hamas negotiator -- angered U.S. officials and Arab leaders, who had believed talks were at a critical stage. While Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its role in the assassination, it told U.S. officials immediately afterward that it was responsible.\n\nEven in April, Arab countries downplayed their roles in staving off the Iranian attack, wary of retaliation from Tehran and not wanting to be seen as supportive of Israel at a time of widespread public fury over the human toll of the Gaza war. Those concerns are even more pronounced now, and Arab states have sought to publicly distance themselves from any involvement in the next round of violence.\n\nJordan and Saudi Arabia have declared they do not want their airspace transformed into a battle zone. Egypt has said it would not \"take part in a military axis that would participate in repelling\" an Iranian attack.\n\nSuch public statements are \"very disturbing,\" according to a senior Israeli politician who helped build the regional coalition, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive security matters. While the Arab states in missile range want Iran contained, he said, the ties that bind them to Israel are delicate, and have only been tested once before on a large scale.\n\nFacing down the prospect of all-out war, \"Israel is operating quite alone,\" he acknowledged.\n\n\"We're working really, really hard, with intense diplomacy, to try to avoid an escalation,\" Kirby told reporters on Wednesday, while adding that President Joe Biden \"ordered additional military resources to the region to make sure that, should Israel be attacked, that the United States can ably come to her defense.\"\n\nIran's attack in April, launched after an Israeli strike near a diplomatic facility in Damascus, was well choreographed, giving Israel and its allies valuable time to prepare. Officials believe the assault this time could be more sudden, larger in scale and longer -- possibly lasting several days instead of several hours. It could also be a coordinated barrage from multiple directions, involving Iranian proxies in Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Lebanon.\n\nOver the past ten months, Hezbollah militants in Lebanon have used low-flying, high-speed explosive drones to hit military sites and private homes in Israel -- eluding the country's vaunted aerial defense systems, which are designed to identify and intercept more traditional rockets that fly at higher altitudes and along linear flight paths. Such drones could pose a significant danger if unleashed in large numbers, weapons experts say.\n\n\"Our response is coming and it will be strong, impactful and effective,\" Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah said in a speech on Wednesday.\n\nThe group could also make use of longer-range munitions that it claims to possess, but has never publicly displayed. Repelling such a barrage would likely come at a high price for Israel: Iron Dome interceptions cost around $30,000 per interception; The Arrow 3, designed to down ballistic missiles, run an estimated $3 million per interception.\n\nIsrael assesses that Hezbollah will start the attack, potentially firing toward Tel Aviv and using guided missiles, according to Yoel Guzansky, a former official on Israel's National Security Council who is now a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv.\n\nA worst-case scenario, he said, would be multi-front attack from other Iranian proxies designed to \"challenge the limits of Israel's systems, which can be overwhelmed ... and which, as seen in April, rely on the regional coalition for strategic depth.\"\n\nGuzansky said Israel has communicated to Hezbollah and Iran that hitting civilian population centers would be a red line, and would elicit a forceful response.\n\n\"If Hezbollah continues its aggression, Israel will fight it, with all its might,\" Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned in a message in Arabic posted on X Thursday. \"He who plays with fire may expect destruction.\"\n\nIsrael might also consider a preemptive attack against Iran if it concluded an attack was imminent, Israeli media reported Monday after Netanyahu met with his defense chiefs. \"That's something that we haven't gotten to yet, but the future is yet to come,\" the senior Israeli politician said.\n\nGen. Michael E. Kurilla, head of U.S. Central Command, was in Israel for a second time this week to discuss military coordination. Newly deployed U.S. assets include a squadron of F-22 Raptors, naval cruisers and destroyers, and the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and its accompanying ships, which are heading toward the Middle East to replace another carrier strike group that will be departing the region.\n\n\"The U.S. is much busier than it was in April, but it also realizes that a regional war will affect the economy, and it is in their interest to stop the escalation,\" said Israel Ziv, a retired major general who served as the head of the Israel Defense Forces Operations Division.\n\nBut he urged Israeli leaders not to take American support for granted: \"Here, I think Israel could make a mistake, in going to a regional war with the assumption that its assets will always be there.\"\n\nHe also predicted Israel would encounter difficulties in keepings its regional coalition together, \"since they're not all ready to work with Netanyahu.\"\n\nAbdullah Al-Junaid, a political analyst in Bahrain, said Gulf states were still invested in partnering with Israel to contain Iran, but that any long-term alliance would require progress toward a resolution between Israel and the Palestinians -- which Netanyahu and his far-right allies have refused to consider. Their intransigence has stalled U.S.-backed efforts to expand normalization agreements between Israel and its Arab neighbors, including Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe current regional conflict \"is empowering the extremist models that Iran represents,\" Junaid said, which \"is in no one's interest.\"\n\n\"Now we need to dig deeper, and find out a Middle East 2.0,\" he said. \"The alternative is not sustainable.\"\n\nLior Soroka in Tel Aviv and Missy Ryan in Jerusalem contributed to this report.

LOOMING REGIONAL ESCALATION\n\nOn July 30, Hezbollah senior military commander Fouad Shokor was killed in an attack on Beirut's southern suburbs.\n\nA day later, Hamas Politburo chief Ismail Haniyeh, who was in the Iranian capital of Tehran to attend the inauguration of Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian, was killed alongside his bodyguard when their residence was struck.\n\nIsrael has claimed responsibility for the killing of Shokor, but has not commented on the assassination of Haniyeh, which Hamas and Iran have attributed to Israel.\n\nRight after the killing of Haniyeh, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei vowed a \"harsh punishment\" for Israel. Earlier this week, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani vowed to take serious and deterrent action against Israel with \"strength and decisiveness,\" and rejected calls for negotiation. President Pezeshkian also said Israel would definitely receive the response to its \"crime and insolent\" move.\n\nAs for the death of Shokor, Hezbollah Leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah on Tuesday vowed an \"impactful and strong\" retaliation. \"We may choose to retaliate in cooperation with other resistance powers in Iran and Yemen or separately.\"\n\n\"The war has entered a new phase,\" Nasrallah said earlier, adding that the upcoming campaign will involve Iran, Yemen and Iraq, in addition to Gaza and Lebanon.\n\nOn Aug. 1, Yemen's Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi warned that the Houthi group will \"inevitably\" mount a military response to Israel's recent escalation.\n\nFor the expected retaliatory attack from Iran and its allies, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the Israeli forces were preparing for \"a swift transition to offense.\" The Israel Defense Forces stated that Chief of the General Staff Herzi Halevi has approved \"operational plans for various scenarios.\"\n\nMore American forces were moving to the region to bolster defenses in and around Israel. The United States was deploying additional warships, including a guided missile cruiser and missile destroyer, as well as another squadron of fighter jets, Israel's state-owned Kan TV news reported, adding that Britain is also expected to help protect Israel in case of an attack.\n\nTit-for-tat attacks between Israel and Hamas-backed armed groups remained intense and heavy following the death of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders. The Palestinian Health Ministry said at least eight Palestinians were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a vehicle carrying aid in central Gaza on Monday, and two more were killed and three others injured by the Israeli forces' bullets near the northern West Bank city of Jenin on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli sources said a drone attack launched on Tuesday from Lebanon by Hezbollah forces injured six people in northern Israel, including one in critical condition.\n\nNegativity has already seeped into various facets of people's lives in the Middle East due to the prolonged regional conflict. The war-torn Gaza and southern Lebanon have been in the throes of a deepening water and electricity crisis.\n\nWith the Palestinian death toll from ongoing Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip nearing 40,000, the crossfire between relevant parties spreading from Gaza into the West Bank, and Iran and its allies' retaliation for Israel being touch and go, fears and anxiety among citizens of regional countries have mounted even more.\n\nSonic booms on Tuesday caused by Israeli warplanes breaking the sound barrier over Lebanon's capital of Beirut have prompted local residents to start packing and seek shelter in mountainous areas.\n\nConcerning the deteriorating regional security situation, T\u00fcrkiye, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Croatia, Slovenia, Norway and Sweden have all advised their citizens to leave Lebanon. Several French and Polish airlines have suspended flights to Lebanon.\n\nMeanwhile, a growing number of airlines, including Ryanair, Wizz Air, Lufthansa, Easyjet and Air India, have suspended flights to Israel due to concerns over instability. REGIONAL WAR BENEFITS NOBODY\n\nRegarding the heightening tension in the Middle East, Eyal Zisser, vice rector of Tel Aviv University and an expert on Middle Eastern Affairs, said the Iranian attacks would be \"limited\" and are not intended to start a regional war.\n\n\"Nobody is interested in a regional war. Nobody is going to gain anything from a regional war,\" he said.\n\n\"But once you start with retaliation, and you retaliate to the retaliation, and so on and so forth, the result can be that you lose control, and we eventually can find ourselves in a regional war. But that's not what all parties want right now,\" he noted. \"When you set up a fire, it's sometimes very difficult to keep the fire on a low level.\"\n\n\"Iran wants to respond to Israel's strikes, systematic assassinations, and the resumption of the assassination policy by Israel, but I think Iran does not want to expand the scope (of the conflict),\" said Hamid Faris, a professor of international relations at Egypt's Misr University for Science and Technology.\n\nNimrod Goren, a senior fellow for Israeli affairs at the Washington-based Middle East Institute, said, \"The fact that a regional war may be averted does not ensure that an Israel-Hezbollah flare-up will be prevented, and such an escalation will cause much damage in Israel and Lebanon, even without a regional war.\"\n\n\"Diplomatic efforts should be stepped up to find an off-ramp soon to the situation along the Israel-Lebanon border,\" he said.\n\nAbdullah Mahmoud, a Cairo-based researcher in Iranian affairs of the Middle East Forum for Strategic Studies and National Security, said, \"The attack this time will be a collaboration of attacks by different resistance movements.\"\n\n\"Hezbollah and Houthis will join the attack. I think there will be a high level of coordination among the resistance movements,\" he said.\n\nTen months after the outbreak of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on Oct. 7, 2023, escalating tension shows no end in sight. The spiral of violence has deeply undermined confidence in achieving peace.\n\nHowever, Goren believes \"achieving peace is possible, but is a longer-term goal.\"\n\n\"In the short term, a ceasefire and hostage release deal should be brokered between Israel and Hamas, then leveraged for defusing tensions along the Israel-Lebanon border, advancing the two-state solution, and promoting Israel-Saudi Arabia normalization,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "unitedkingdomnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "United Kingdom News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Hezbollah was founded by Iran in 1982 by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC).\n\nIran has many proxies in Iraq; however, the three major terror organizations they control are Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis in Yemen. Hezbollah means \"Party of Allah,\" and it is Iran's strongest proxy.\n\nHezbollah has been firing rockets into Israel almost nonstop since October 8th -- a day after the Hamas militants stormed into southern Israel and committed its atrocious massacre. Cross-border fighting has gone on almost daily for nearly ten months, as both sides are firing back and forth.\n\nIsrael has taken out several key Iranian and Hezbollah leaders during this exchange of fire, and many thousands of Israelis have been displaced in the country's north. I was reading this week that northern Israel is littered today with what we could call \"ghost towns.\"\n\nIsrael has been fighting against Hamas in Gaza, down to the south, but the ongoing question is: when will this northern front with Hezbollah break out?\n\nFor ten months now, there's been a great deal of back and forth, but all-out war has been avoided. Israel and Hezbollah have been pursuing a long campaign of almost \"low-level hostilities\" along the border. However, last Saturday, it appears that Hezbollah may have gone too far.\n\nWe all saw news of the missile strike in the Golan Heights that killed 12 children between the ages of 10 and 20 who were practicing out on a soccer field. The Hezbollah rocket, fired from Lebanon, hit this soccer field in a Druze-Arab village.\n\nThe Druze are a people who live in northern Israel, as well as in Syria and Lebanon. There are about a million Duze people today. They are an Arab sect, considered separate from Islam, that believes in a conglomeration of several religions and philosophies. Really, they are an offshoot of Islam.\n\nDespite Iran denying any connection whatsoever, the deadly rocket that hit the Druze soccer field was unequivocally proven to have been made in Iran. Tehran's fingerprints are all over this brutal attack.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the missile was fired at a community in the Golan Heights. You may wonder, what is the Golan Heights? The Golan Heights is about a 500 square mile-area in northern Israel that borders Syria.\n\nIt was captured by Israel in the 1967 war. While it is claimed to be a disputed territory, when Donald Trump was President, it was recognized as part of Israel. Because of its location in proximity to the borders of Lebanon and Syria, it is more accessible to rocket fire.\n\nIn light of this missile attack, Israel's security cabinet approved a military response, giving Prime Minister Netanyahu full leeway to respond to this attack.\n\nCNN has a headline that says, \"The Israel-Hezbollah War That No One Wants Could Finally Blow Up.\" Hezbollah's attack could be the final trigger for this war. Prime Minister Netanyahu said on Monday, \"Our response is coming, and it will be severe.\"\n\nOver the course of a few hours, Israel this week carried out the targeted elimination of Fuad Shukr, Hezbollah's military chief, who ordered the deadly rocket attack, and Ismail Haniyeh, chairman of Hamas' Political Bureau, who was in Tehran for the inauguration of Iran's new President.\n\nThe world right now is holding its collective breath. Will Hezbollah unleash a full offensive, and what part might Iran play in this war if it breaks out?\n\nHezbollah has at least 150,000 missiles and rockets pointing south into Israel, and many of those projectiles are locked on Tel Aviv. A war would certainly devastate Lebanon, but would also do serious damage to Israel.\n\nNow, at the same time that Israel is facing this potential Northern Front war with Hezbollah in Lebanon, Turkey is turning up the heat on Israel in a major way. Earlier this week, they issued a threat of invading Israel.\n\nThis is a stunning development. A headline from Fox News reads, \"Turkey's Erdogan Threatens To Invade Israel Over The War In Gaza, As Regional Tensions Grow.\" This is a shocking and significant escalation by Turkey, which is a member of NATO.

Airlines are cancelling flights to Beirut, Tehran and Tel Aviv. Civilians in Lebanon are filling their cars with petrol; stressed-out Israelis are ordering more fast food. The Middle East has been on tenterhooks for more than a week, awaiting the latest escalation in ten months of fighting between Israel, Iran and its militant allies. As The Economist went to press, that escalation had yet to happen -- but much of the region expects it will in the coming days.\n\nIt has seemed inevitable since July 30th, when Israel bombed Beirut's southern suburbs and killed Fuad Shukr, a top commander in Hizbullah, the Lebanese Shia militia. That was in response to a rocket fired from Lebanon on July 27th, which killed 12 children on a football pitch in the Golan Heights. A few hours later Israel assassinated Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas, while he was visiting Tehran. Both Hizbullah and Iran have vowed to retaliate. If they do, their attacks will probably be co-ordinated, and may involve other Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, Syria or Yemen.\n\nFor years, analysts focused on Iran had two core assumptions: that it wanted to fight Israel through proxies, rather than directly, and that it wanted to keep the conflict below the threshold of all-out war. Both assumptions look increasingly fragile. Iran launched a barrage of more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel in April, after an Israeli air strike killed two generals at Iran's embassy compound in Damascus. It spent the first week of August contemplating whether to do so again. The taboo against direct conflict seems broken.\n\nAnd Iran's recent rhetoric has suggested a new appetite for risk-taking. In meetings with their Arab counterparts, Iranian diplomats have been uncompromising, promising to retaliate harshly against Israel even if it plunges the region into all-out war. Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hizbullah, struck a similar tone in a speech on August 6th. He vowed to avenge Shukr's death \"whatever the consequences\".\n\nIf Iran and its proxies sound more willing to gamble, it is because Israel has grown less restrained, too. Since October 7th, when Hamas fighters massacred more than 1,200 Israelis and started an ever-widening war, Israel has carried out a spree of assassinations. It has struck Iranian officers in Syria and Lebanon, commanders of Hizbullah's elite Radwan force in south Lebanon, and much of the top Hamas leadership in Gaza, Beirut and Tehran.\n\nThough assassination is hardly a new tactic for Israel, Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, had been reluctant to order high-level hits during his many years in office. But that caution has seemingly evaporated since October 7th. From Israel's perspective, Hamas has already done its worst and Hizbullah and other Iranian-backed groups have joined the fight. No need to fear that assassinations might cause a regional escalation: it is already here.\n\nAdd to that Mr Netanyahu's personal and political calculations. Israelis are eager to avenge October 7th, and the assassinations are another way for the prime minister to try to revive his plummeting popularity. For Israel's security chiefs, meanwhile, such killings are an opportunity to prove they have not lost their touch.\n\nThe strike on the Iranian embassy compound in Damascus forced Iran to respond. Its attack in April caused little damage. Most of the projectiles were shot down by an ad hoc coalition of Western and Arab armies, or by Israel's air defences. But physical damage was, at best, a secondary goal of the strike. Iran's main objective was to lay down a marker: any attack on its territory would be answered in kind.\n\nIsrael ignored that marker. To be sure, there are differences between the killing of Haniyeh and the embassy strike in Damascus. Though Haniyeh was killed on Iranian soil, he was not Iranian. Israel did not take responsibility for either attack, but the method of Haniyeh's assassination -- which seems to have been a bomb smuggled into his guesthouse -- has muddied the waters. Israeli officials hope this will allow Iran to avoid a dramatic reprisal.\n\nBut Iran seems bent on one. If it holds back, it will concede that it cannot deter Israel. Yet as it weighs a direct response, it is confronting an awkward reality. Its reliance on proxies was not only a way to keep conflict away from its borders, but also to mask the weakness of its conventional forces. Even if Iranian diplomats threaten an all-out war with Israel, the Iranian armed forces cannot wage one.\n\nThough Iran has more than 3,000 ballistic missiles in its arsenal, not all of them have the range to reach Israel (see map). Its liquid-fuelled missiles, like the Emad used against Israel in April, need hours to fuel and prepare for launch -- time an adversary can use to target the launchers.\n\nIran also has thousands of cruise missiles and drones with the range to reach Israel. But they need hours to cover the more than 1,000km between the two countries, giving Israel ample warning. That distance also means any sort of ground offensive is out of the question. Geography matters. Iran is too far away to bring overwhelming force to bear against Israel.\n\nSome of its proxies face a similar problem. The Houthis in Yemen managed to kill an Israeli civilian in July using a long-range drone that slipped through Israel's air defences. But most of the more than 200 missiles and drones they have fired at Israel have been swatted away.\n\nEven in a new era of direct conflict with Israel, Iran must rely on Hizbullah, its most powerful proxy. Yet to unleash the Lebanese militia now would carry a dual risk. It would prompt a heavy Israeli bombardment -- and possibly an invasion -- of Lebanon. Israel cannot destroy Hizbullah, which has deep roots in Lebanese society, its economy and political system. But it can damage the military capabilities that Iran has spent decades building up.\n\nThe bigger concern, though, is that Israel might not stop at hitting Lebanon. When it bombed the port of Hodeidah in Yemen on July 20th, in retaliation for the deadly Houthi drone attack, Israel was trying not only to deter the Houthis. It was also sending a message to Iran: Hodeidah, after all, is farther away from Israel than most of Iran's big cities.\n\nIranian strategists might wonder, in hindsight, if they erred in April. The barrage they fired at Israel did not create deterrence. Instead it may have locked them into escalating the war yet again -- at great risk to their proxies, and to themselves. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "economist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Mr Shine is a former officer in Mossad, the Israeli security agency, and the head of the Iran program at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv.\n\nHezbollah is \"more committed\" to attack, Mr Shine said, as \"Nasrallah personally feels obliged to his friend and colleague for so many years\".\n\nThe news that Hezbollah might attack Israel independently and ahead of Iran was first reported on Thursday by CNN, which said its sources were familiar with the intelligence.\n\nOne US military official told the channel that Iran had made some of the preparations needed to launch an assault - but not all of them.\n\nA second source said Hezbollah could act with little or no notice, given the short distance between its missile launchers and Israel.\n\nBoth Hezbollah and Iran have said they will retaliate for the killings - but not how.\n\nHaniyeh, the leader of the Hamas terror group, was assassinated in Tehran as he visited for the inauguration of Iran's new president. Hezbollah, of which Shukr was a founding member, is an Iranian proxy group.\n\nWhile any further response Hezbollah makes to the death of Shukr is likely to be co-ordinated with Tehran, the terror group is still capable of acting independently at times, analysts noted.\n\nNasrallah said in a speech on Tuesday that the ambiguity around its response was part of \"the punishment\" for Israel, which has seen hundreds of international flights cancelled and a marked downturn in social and economic activity.\n\n\"The little anxieties pool together like beads of water on a tabletop,\" said Linda Dayan, a journalist with the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, of the mood in the country on Thursday.\n\nIran has said it will retaliate \"at the right time\" but officials have also stressed it is not seeking to escalate matters to a full-scale war.\n\nIn April, it launched more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel a full two weeks after an Israeli strike on its embassy in Damascus.\n\n\"How Iran and the resistance front will respond is currently being reviewed... This will certainly happen and the Zionist regime [Israel] will undoubtedly regret it,\" General Mohammad Baqeri, Iran's armed forces chief of staff, told state TV on Thursday.\n\nThe country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is a hard-line Islamist but has long embraced a policy of political expediency or \"heroic flexibility\" when it comes to international relations.\n\nOn Thursday, US officials indicated Iran was once again telegraphing its intentions ahead of time, giving the US time to to manoeuvre defensive military assets including aircraft carriers into position.\n\n\"Iran understands clearly that the US is unwavering in its defence of our interests, our partners and our people. We have moved a significant amount of military assets to the region to underscore that principle,\" a senior Biden administration official told the Washington Post.\n\nIn recent years, Iran has developed important diplomatic and trading relationships with China, Russia and Saudi Arabia in a bid to counter US and Israeli influence in the region and has much to lose if it calibrates its response poorly.\n\nSome analysts believe that despite tactical military wins, including the recent assassinations, Israel is losing the strategic battle in the region and that Iran does not want to disrupt that trajectory.\n\nThis view is rejected by many in the Israeli defence establishment and the country's political Right.\n\n\"They want our blood and their honour back,\" said Assaf Orion, a retired Israeli brigadier general and a fellow of the The Washington Institute, of the likely response to the killings.\n\n\"By desert rules, if you can't protect your guests, you're good

They don't really know much about her, but they know she is not Donald Trump.\n\nHarris now has a good chance of overtaking Trump in the presidential race, but only so long as the United States does not get dragged into a big war in the Middle East. However, she is not in charge of U.S. foreign policy. Biden is still running that, and he still seems incapable of saying no to Israel no matter what it does.\n\nWhat Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is doing at the moment is systematically crossing the 'red lines' laid down by Israel's most dangerous enemies, Iran and its proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah.\n\nIn conventional military terms, that doesn't make sense. The Israel Defence Forces are already heavily engaged in fighting Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Israeli troops are tired, and the economy is suffering from the repeated call-ups of reservists. The army doesn't want to open up another front.\n\nHezbollah and the Israeli army have been involved in a low-intensity exchange of rockets and artillery fire across Israel's northern border ever since Hamas's attack on Israel last October. However, the targets on both sides were limited to the first 20 kilometres beyond the border, where most civilians have been evacuated. No attacks on Beirut, no attacks on Tel Aviv.\n\nIran, with 90 million people and an Islamist government, could be an existential threat to Israel if it had nuclear weapons, but it has deliberately stopped just short of that technology. It supports various Arab members of the 'Axis of Resistance' with money and weapons, but it avoids direct clashes with Israel and the two do not have a common border.\n\nSo it is obviously in Israel's interest to maintain the status quo with Hezbollah and Iran -- and yet Netanyahu has begun trying to undermine it.\n\nHis first initiative was a missile strike four months ago that killed two Iranian generals and five other officers who were visiting Iran's embassy in Syria. Israel often 'deniably' assassinates Iranian officers, officials and scientists, but this was a direct challenge that was certain to evoke an Iranian military response.\n\nNeither Teheran nor Washington wanted to get drawn into a war, however, so they co-ordinated a charade in which Iran launched 300 missiles and drones against Israel but all of them were shot down or missed their targets. Honour was satisfied, and Netanyahu was thwarted.\n\nBut then in July, Joe Biden pulled out of the presidential race, Kamala Harris became the candidate, and the prospect of a less blindly supportive U.S. ally loomed on the horizon. How best to ensure that Harris doesn't win and Netanyahu's friend Donald Trump becomes president instead? Drag the U.S. into a war with Iran before the election.\n\nA pretext for that soon presented itself in the form of a random Hezbollah missile in the usual tit-for-tat along the Israeli-Lebanese border that killed a dozen young Druze who were playing football. It wasn't unusual and it probably wasn't even deliberately targeted at the football field, but it gave Netanyahu the excuse he needed.\n\nOn the night of 30-31 July Israeli missiles flew to Beirut, Hezbollah's red line, to kill Fuad Shukr, Hezbollah's second-in-command. Only hours later an Israeli missile or bomb (accounts vary) killed Hamas's political head, Ismail Haniyeh -- and it killed him in Tehran, to ensure that Iran also felt obliged to retaliate.\n\nTo people unfamiliar with the way the game is played in the Middle East this account may sound paranoid, or even specifically anti-Israeli. It is not. I offer in defence the analysis by Alon Pinkas in the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz on Aug. 1: \"Israel could have killed Haniyeh anywhere in the Middle East, yet chose to do so in Tehran during the inauguration of the new president ... Israel left Tehran no alternative but to retaliate.\"\n\n\"Who has no interest in such an escalation? The United States, whose makeshift Middle East policy will now have to be revisited, and Iran, which clearly prefers attrition and low intensity.\"\n\n\"Who does have a vested interest in an expanded war? Mr. Netanyahu. Which is why the conventional wisdom in Washington over the last 36 hours is that Israel carried out the Haniyeh assassination deliberately in Iran and intentionally on that day.\"\n\nAnd what is dear old Joe Biden doing?\n\nHe's sending another aircraft carrier to the eastern Mediterranean to 'defend Israel' (and maybe fight Iran) when he should be using the leverage of the US$6.5 billion of extra military aid Washington has sent Israel since last October to force a ceasefire in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winnipeg Free Press"}, "authors":

In contrast, Iran is reportedly still determining its response to the situation, with some US military officials noting that while Iran has made some preparations for a major attack, they are not yet fully in place.\n\nGiven Lebanon's proximity to Israel, Hezbollah could act with little notice, unlike Iran, according to the second source.\n\nThere is currently no clear evidence of coordination between Hezbollah and Iran regarding a potential attack, and officials suggest the two may not be fully aligned on their approach.\n\nThe potential attacks are reportedly in response to recent events, including Israel's killing of Hezbollah's top military commander, Fuad Shokor, in Lebanon last week. The following day, Israel assassinated Hamas' political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran. Israel has not confirmed or denied its involvement in the latter incident; however, Iranian authorities confirmed that Tel Aviv is behind the attack.\n\n\"Hezbollah and Iran can respond to the Israeli assassinations but will act cautiously and carefully,\" Hezbollah's secretary-general Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said.\n\nIn the wake of these developments, global attention is focused on the region. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) convened an extraordinary meeting on Wednesday in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to address the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The meeting resulted in a draft communiqu\u00e9 condemning Israel's actions and expressing solidarity with the Palestinian cause.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 notably condemned the assassination of Haniyeh, calling it a \"heinous crime\" and a violation of international law and the UN Charter. The OIC warned that such actions undermine regional security and stability.\n\nUS President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have been actively engaging with leaders across the Middle East this week, including those from Jordan, Qatar, and Egypt, to urge de-escalation in the region.", "source": {"uri": "shafaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

They can't even imagine what might happen,\" Gallant told troops of the 646th Reserve Paratroopers Brigade.\n\nThe defense minister said that a miscalculation by Hezbollah could lead to war.\n\n\"This may also deteriorate into a war. It's not theoretical, it's real,\" Gallant told the soldiers.\n\nAccording to a report by CNN, Hezbollah could strike Israel independently of Iran in the coming days.\n\nThe report says that the terror group \"is moving faster than Iran in its planning\" and is expected to attack Israel in a matter of days.\n\nPreviously, both U.S. and Israeli officials had expected that Iran and Hezbollah could coordinate their attacks for maximum impact. However, now officials believe that Iran is moving more cautiously, as it attempts to avoid action that could lead to a full-scale war.\n\nAnalysts believe that Hezbollah is feeling increasing urgency to attack in a major way, as Israel has been consistently eliminating high-level and mid-level officers. The group is likely feeling pressure to respond in a show of force to demonstrate their continued capabilities.\n\nHezbollah has been threatening to retaliate since the killing of Fuad Shukr in Beirut last week. In a speech at the funeral of Shukr, Nasrallah said the war against Israel had entered a new phase.\n\nSaying that Israel \"does not know where the retaliation will come from,\" he also threatened that Israelis who celebrated Shukr's death would soon cry.\n\n\"You will laugh a little and cry a lot, as you do not know which redlines you have crossed,\" Nasrallah warned.\n\nIDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi on Wednesday said that Israel is on high alert as it awaits a response by Hezbollah and Iran.\n\n\"We will be able to launch a swift attack anywhere in Lebanon, anywhere in Gaza, anywhere in the Middle East, above ground and below ground,\" Halevi said to Israeli Air Force personnel at Tel Nof airbase. \"We will send a very clear message to our enemies, those who attack us, those who in every speech talk about how they seek to destroy the State of Israel. We will strike them, and we will continue to grow stronger.\"\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for Israeli citizens to remain calm despite the threats from Iran and Hezbollah.\n\n\"We are continuing forward to victory. I know that Israeli citizens are on alert, and I ask you one thing -- stay calm and composed,\" Netanyahu said while speaking to new recruits at the Tel Hashomer recruitment base. \"We are prepared for both defense and offense, we are striking our enemies and are also determined to defend ourselves.\"\n\nRepublished with permission from All Israel News", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hassan Nasrallah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratroopers_Brigade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paratroopers Brigade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herzi_Halevi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Herzi Halevi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_the_General_Staff_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief of the General Staff (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israelis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=2b9366d5-0ae7-4a0c-bd99-df5105fc629f&SiteName=Newsmax&maxsidesize=280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799808", "eventUri": "eng-9799808", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The attack may have been an isolated incident, but there are signs it could be part of a broader escalation in the region.\n\nThe attack comes amid escalating violence in the Middle East. Israel is continuing its war in Gaza and recently reportedly assassinated Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in Iran and Lebanon, respectively. Iran, which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah, has blamed Israel for the attacks and is expected to retaliate. Uncertainty over Iran's response now raises the possibility of a broader conflict in the region.\n\nIt is unclear whether Iran had anything to do with the attack on Assad, and no group has claimed responsibility for the attack so far. Iranian-allied groups operate in Iraq, such as the Iraqi militia Kataeb Hezbollah. But even if one of these groups is behind the attack, it does not necessarily mean it was ordered by Iran; Iran's allies in Iraq sometimes act without explicit instructions.\n\nBut whatever the calculation behind Monday's attacks, they are a reminder of how easily the conflict between Israel and Gaza could escalate and spiral out of control.\n\nIsrael and Iran have been increasing the pressure in recent weeks\n\nAlthough Iraqi President Mohammed Shia al-Sudani announced in January his intention to expel American troops from his country, about 2,500 American troops remain in Iraq, part of a mission to fight the Islamic State.\n\nU.S. forces have recently targeted militias known as the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), which they accuse of plotting to launch drones that threaten U.S. installations.\n\nThe PMF is often thought of as being backed by Iran, and indeed it does have Iranian support, although the story is a bit more complicated than that. While Iran does fund and equip militia groups in Iraq, they are not as closely tied to the Islamic Republic as Hezbollah is in Lebanon and have their own agendas.\n\nThe PMF is technically part of the Iraqi military. It played a critical role in the fight against ISIS, particularly early in the conflict, as a recent RAND Corporation report points out. However, it carries out attacks that further Iran's foreign policy goals of defeating Israel and driving Americans out of the Middle East. For example, the groups have been launching rocket attacks on U.S. facilities since around 2020, after the U.S. assassination of Qasem Soleimani, a revered Iranian military leader, though some have occurred as early as 2019.\n\nMonday's attack could be seen as Iran's response to last week's U.S. attack that killed four people, but it could also be part of Iran's response to the assassinations of Haniyeh and Shukr. This is especially true since Haniyeh was killed in Iran, a fact that has embarrassed the country and its security forces. And while Iran has blamed Israel for the attacks, the country's leaders also view the United States as complicit, given the strength of the U.S.-Israeli alliance.\n\nThe question is whether Iran can respond in a way that convinces Israel and the United States to step down rather than continue escalation, Colin Clarke, a senior fellow at the Soufan Center, told Vox.\n\nI think that's the challenge for the Iranians: trying to find the right balance to respond in a way that doesn't come off as completely helpless and doesn't reveal their weakness, but they also don't want to go too far.\n\nToo strong a response could provoke further violence from Israel, and perhaps the United States, putting the world at risk of an even bigger war. But it is increasingly difficult to assess the capacity of Israel and the United States to withstand an Iranian response, Ali Vaez, Iran program director at the International Crisis Group, told Vox.\n\nI think that's where the risk lies mainly, because [Iran feels that] Without inflicting pain, there is no gain in terms of deterrence, and Israel is not a country that simply absorbs pain and does not respond even to American pressure, Vaez said.\n\nSo what happens next in the Middle East?\n\nFears of a regional war began with Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7 and have continued as regional powers have engaged in so-called rocket diplomacy; essentially carefully calibrated attacks designed to send a message.\n\nIn the case of the airbase attack, Vaez said the message could be that if [the US] If Israel fails to contain Iran's retaliation for Haniyeh's killing in Tehran, the United States would also be caught in the crossfire this time.\n\nHow Iran and its allies respond to the recent assassinations will determine the extent of the conflict and whether the balance of violence in places like Lebanon, where Israel and Hezbollah have exchanged rocket fire over the country's southern border and Israeli warplanes have produced a sonic boom over Beirut, is upset.\n\nAny Iranian response to the killings of Haniyeh and Shukr would likely rely on Iran's regional partners overwhelming Israel's Iron Dome defense system with rocket fire, so that at least some munitions would get through and cause real damage, if not casualties.\n\n\"Let's say they end up killing a lot of Israeli civilians in a missile or rocket attack, which is possible if Iron Dome is overwhelmed and malfunctions,\" Clarke said. If it escalates too much, the Israelis are really going to continue, particularly Netanyahu, to pressure the United States to get more involved, which is not a good scenario for the Iranians.\n\nAnd, according to Vaez, this is a real possibility, with a more sophisticated and multi-layered strategy on the Iranian side.\n\nIn such a scenario, strikes and counterattacks would likely continue and the death toll would rise, in Iran, among its allied groups and perhaps also in Israel.\n\nYou have read 1 article in the last month\n\nAt Vox, we want to help everyone understand our complex world, so we can all help shape it.

Earlier this week, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani vowed to take serious and deterrent action against Israel with \"strength and decisiveness,\" and rejected calls for negotiation. President Pezeshkian also said Israel would definitely receive the response to its \"crime and insolent\" move.\n\nAs for the death of Shokor, Hezbollah Leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah on Tuesday vowed an \"impactful and strong\" retaliation. \"We may choose to retaliate in cooperation with other resistance powers in Iran and Yemen or separately.\"\n\n\"The war has entered a new phase,\" Nasrallah said earlier, adding that the upcoming campaign will involve Iran, Yemen and Iraq, in addition to Gaza and Lebanon.\n\nOn Aug. 1, Yemen's Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi warned that the Houthi group will \"inevitably\" mount a military response to Israel's recent escalation.\n\nFor the expected retaliatory attack from Iran and its allies, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the Israeli forces were preparing for \"a swift transition to offense.\" The Israel Defense Forces stated that Chief of the General Staff Herzi Halevi has approved \"operational plans for various scenarios.\"\n\nMore American forces were moving to the region to bolster defenses in and around Israel. The United States was deploying additional warships, including a guided missile cruiser and missile destroyer, as well as another squadron of fighter jets, Israel's state-owned Kan TV news reported, adding that Britain is also expected to help protect Israel in case of an attack.\n\nTit-for-tat attacks between Israel and Hamas-backed armed groups remained intense and heavy following the death of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders. The Palestinian Health Ministry said at least eight Palestinians were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a vehicle carrying aid in central Gaza on Monday, and two more were killed and three others injured by the Israeli forces' bullets near the northern West Bank city of Jenin on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli sources said a drone attack launched on Tuesday from Lebanon by Hezbollah forces injured six people in northern Israel, including one in critical condition.\n\nNegativity has already seeped into various facets of people's lives in the Middle East due to the prolonged regional conflict. The war-torn Gaza and southern Lebanon have been in the throes of a deepening water and electricity crisis.\n\nWith the Palestinian death toll from ongoing Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip nearing 40,000, the crossfire between relevant parties spreading from Gaza into the West Bank, and Iran and its allies' retaliation for Israel being touch and go, fears and anxiety among citizens of regional countries have mounted even more.\n\nSonic booms on Tuesday caused by Israeli warplanes breaking the sound barrier over Lebanon's capital of Beirut have prompted local residents to start packing and seek shelter in mountainous areas.\n\nConcerning the deteriorating regional security situation, T\u00fcrkiye, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Croatia, Slovenia, Norway and Sweden have all advised their citizens to leave Lebanon. Several French and Polish airlines have suspended flights to Lebanon.\n\nMeanwhile, a growing number of airlines, including Ryanair, Wizz Air, Lufthansa, Easyjet and Air India, have suspended flights to Israel due to concerns over instability.\n\nRegarding the heightening tension in the Middle East, Eyal Zisser, vice rector of Tel Aviv University and an expert on Middle Eastern Affairs, said the Iranian attacks would be \"limited\" and are not intended to start a regional war.\n\n\"Nobody is interested in a regional war. Nobody is going to gain anything from a regional war,\" he said.\n\n\"But once you start with retaliation, and you retaliate to the retaliation, and so on and so forth, the result can be that you lose control, and we eventually can find ourselves in a regional war. But that's not what all parties want right now,\" he noted. \"When you set up a fire, it's sometimes very difficult to keep the fire on a low level.\"\n\n\"Iran wants to respond to Israel's strikes, systematic assassinations, and the resumption of the assassination policy by Israel, but I think Iran does not want to expand the scope (of the conflict),\" said Hamid Faris, a professor of international relations at Egypt's Misr University for Science and Technology.\n\nNimrod Goren, a senior fellow for Israeli affairs at the Washington-based Middle East Institute, said, \"The fact that a regional war may be averted does not ensure that an Israel-Hezbollah flare-up will be prevented, and such an escalation will cause much damage in Israel and Lebanon, even without a regional war.\"\n\n\"Diplomatic efforts should be stepped up to find an off-ramp soon to the situation along the Israel-Lebanon border,\" he said.\n\nAbdullah Mahmoud, a Cairo-based researcher in Iranian affairs of the Middle East Forum for Strategic Studies and National Security, said, \"The attack this time will be a collaboration of attacks by different resistance movements.\"\n\n\"Hezbollah and Houthis will join the attack. I think there will be a high level of coordination among the resistance movements,\" he said.\n\nTen months after the outbreak of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on Oct. 7, 2023, escalating tension shows no end in sight. The spiral of violence has deeply undermined confidence in achieving peace.\n\nHowever, Goren believes \"achieving peace is possible, but is a longer-term goal.\"\n\n\"In the short term, a ceasefire and hostage release deal should be brokered between Israel and Hamas, then leveraged for defusing tensions along the Israel-Lebanon border, advancing the two-state solution, and promoting Israel-Saudi Arabia normalization,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But statements like these haven't stopped Israelis from panicking in the past week about possible retaliation from Israel's enemies.\n\nIsrael took responsibility for Shukr's killing and has not publicly commented on Haniyeh's assassination, for which Hamas and Iran blamed Israel. Both Iran and Hezbollah have threatened a harsh retaliation in a \"couple of days or weeks,\" vowing to show the world \"scenes never seen before.\"\n\nAfter the April assassination of two Iranian generals in Damascus, Iran directly attacked Israel with hundreds of missiles and drones, almost all of which were shot down by Israel and an international coalition. Iran has promised an even stronger response to Haniyeh's assassination on Iranian soil.\n\nHezbollah, which is funded by Iran, said that it will also take part in a coordinated attack to avenge the death of Shukr, one of the group's key figures.\n\nThe long wait for retaliation has opened up discussions in Israel about whether to attack preemptively or wait to see the impact of further escalation.\n\nIsrael is prepared to strike even preemptively and could face any challenge at the moment. I personally believe that we should not wait any longer.\n\n\"We still have families that have been far away from their homes for far too long in the north. This is not acceptable, so maybe we need to act by force and take back control of our land from Hezbollah,\" Brig. Gen. (res.) Ram Shmueli, former head of the Israeli military's Air Intelligence Group, told The Media Line. \"Israel is prepared to strike even preemptively and could face any challenge at the moment. I personally believe that we should not wait any longer.\"\n\nHe said that the relative weakness of Iran and Hezbollah's air forces compared to Israel's is liable to provide a false sense of security.\n\n\"We have nothing against Lebanese and Iranian people, but terrorism must be defeated for their sake as well,\" he said.\n\nDavid Menashri, an Iran expert at Tel Aviv University, told The Media Line that the Iranian opposition and the country's new president are putting pressure on Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei not to attack Israel.\n\n\"The people of Iran want to live and are gradually distancing themselves from religion,\" Menashri said. \"Most of them clearly hope that the new president may pursue peace in the region and are against the concept of war, which may impact Khamenei's actions in the long run.\"\n\nIsrael is not that good at the game of patience like Iran, so it will be interesting to see if it will act first. Iran is clearly winning the psychological warfare at the moment.\n\nHe described the conflict between Israel and Iran as a cat-and-mouse game. \"Israel is not that good at the game of patience like Iran, so it will be interesting to see if it will act first,\" he said. \"Iran is clearly winning the psychological warfare at the moment.\"\n\nFear of escalation is taking its toll on Israelis as the country faces its tenth month of war, with conflict raging at the northern and southern borders. Central Israel has also faced violence from Iran-backed militias, such as in last month's Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv that killed one civilian.\n\nIsraeli public institutions have also been affected by the conflict. With the looming possibility of a more intense war, some are uncertain whether Israel's hospitals and other institutions are up to the task.\n\n\"Our hospital is 100% ready,\" Steve Waltz, a spokesperson for Sheba Medical Center in central Israel, told The Media Line. \"We have enough doctors, nurses, and support personnel for any scenario. We have treated thousands of soldiers and civilians hit by attacks throughout these months and among them 36 hostages.\"\n\nHe said that the hospital also has an underground facility with a 2,000-bed capacity.\n\nDavid Ratner, spokesperson for Rambam Hospital in Haifa, told The Media Line that Rambam is preparing for potential Hezbollah missile fire.\n\nJust two days after October 7, Ratner said, Rambam began converting part of an underground parking lot to operate as a protected hospital unit.\n\n\"We already have all the tools and equipment necessary in case of emergency,\" Ratner said of the underground unit. \"Currently, there are 1,200 beds, and we are just waiting for the government to give us instructions to move the patients here.\"\n\nGil Meller, deputy spokesperson for Haifa, told The Media Line that the northern city has emergency response plans in place.\n\n\"We have more than 100 public shelters around the city, and since we are aware that not every resident has their own safe room inside the house, we turned parking lots into shelters that may contain thousands of people. They are already provided with generators and Wi-Fi,\" he said.\n\nMeller said that the municipality is working on plans to hold public school classes in these shelters if needed. Families that fled Israel's northern border for Haifa and are now living in hotels are also included in the emergency plan.", "source": {"uri": "themedialine.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Media Line"}, "authors": [{"uri": "giorgia_valente@themedialine.org", "name": "Giorgia Valente", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_Joint_Task_Force_\u2013_Operation_Inherent_Resolve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Combined Joint Task Force \u2013 Operation Inherent Resolve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Damascus"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Damascus"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychological warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ali Khamenei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheba_Medical_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheba Medical Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maimonides"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haifa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haifa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haifa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://themedialine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2164692095-e1723201587591-564x318.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799808", "eventUri": "eng-9799808", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-10-07", "textStart": 4322, "textEnd": 4331}], "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

While no one has claimed responsibility for Haniyeh's death, Iranian officials were quick to point the blame at Israel and the United States as its ally.\n\nWithin hours of the July 31 blast, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei declared Iran is duty-bound to avenge Haniyeh.\n\nGen. Hossein Salami, the head of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) continued to suggest a \"strong response\" was coming Israel's way on Monday.\n\n\"Any attack by Iran against Israel or American interests would be unjustified and met with decisive force,\" Johnson said Tuesday. \"America and our allies and partners in the region should work together to strongly counter Iran and its terror proxies to send a clear message against these malign activities.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) has urged President Joe Biden to unblock any and all pending U.S. weapons shipments to Israel, amid heightened concerns over an expanding conflict with Iran.\n\nJohnson then turned his attention to a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel that the Biden administration has kept on hold since May.\n\n\"Now is the time for the White House to realize their choices have brought us to the brink of disaster and give full-throated support to Israel,\" Johnson said. \"President Biden must immediately release all previously withheld and delayed weapons to Israel -- so it can defend its people and deter Iran -- and make clear that there will be decisive economic, military, and international ramifications should Iran engage in or support any attacks.\"\n\nThe Biden administration, thus far, has signaled it is bolstering U.S. air defense capabilities throughout the region. Still, the Biden administration has urged Israel and Iran to avoid further escalations.\n\nIsrael and Iran went through a previous round of tit-for-tat exchanges in April. The last escalatory cycle began when after Iran assessed Israel was responsible for an April 1 airstrike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus, Syria. Iranian forces launched a wave of drone and missile attacks targeting Israel on April 13.\n\nNo decisive Iranian attack on Israel has materialized since July 31, but U.S. and Israeli forces have continued to contend with Iran's regional partners.\n\nThe U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said, in an emailed statement on Tuesday, that five U.S. servicemembers and two U.S. contractors were injured when a pair of rockets struck the Asad Airbase in Iraq on Aug. 5. CENTCOM said the post-strike assessment continues, but that all seven individuals are in stable condition. The U.S. military command reported five of the injured personnel were being treated on location at the Asad Airbase, while two more had been evacuated for further care.\n\nThe Israeli military reported striking targets in the Gaza Strip targeting Hamas on Monday and Tuesday. They also reported targeting Hezbollah leaders and suspected Hezbollah sites in southern Lebanon.\n\nHezbollah has appeared to launch its own strikes on Israel. The group claimed responsibility for drone and rocket attacks across northern Israel on Monday.\n\nThe Israeli military also reported several Israeli citizens were injured during a series of drone attacks near the northern coastal city of Nahariya on Tuesday. Israeli forces subsequently said the injuries may have resulted from a misfired Israeli air defense missile, but they are still investigating the incident.", "source": {"uri":

The sequence of events indicates more professional strategy of Israelis in targeting commanders of Iranian proxies, which is certainly better than mass punishments of Palestinians influenced by revenge psychosis, adopted so far. The ball is currently in the court of Iran, which is evaluating options to recover from the embarrassment of assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in its soil as a guest. Although few interim exchanges have taken place between Hezbollah and Israel, and a US strike on Iraqi non state actor and retaliation in US base, post assassination, but these are routine exchanges as major retaliation is yet to come. The next move of Iran could shape the future escalation dynamics in the region.\n\nThe Assassination Drive\n\nWhile Israel may not own up its hand in assassination of Hamas top political leader and negotiator Ismail Haniyeh and USA has announced that it was neither informed, nor is involved in it, the Iranians have assumed it as a successful covert operation by Mossad (Israel).\n\nWhile the ownership of killing of Hezbollah's No 2 Commander Fuad Shukr in Southern Beirut, Ali Nazih Abed Ali a Senior Officer in Southwestern Lebanon, Hamas leader Mohammad Deif in Gaza and some Iranian Republic Guard Corps (IRGC) Commanders in Syria is well established, it's the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, which seems to be the most important trigger for escalation, where Israel is exercising the option of plausible deniability.\n\nThe western media's initial narrative of internal feud within Hamas, with hardliners seeing Ismail too moderate, or Iran not being happy of Hamas handshake with Fatah in Beijing being cause of assassination, hasn't found any takers. The intention, benefits and capacity to do so in past (Israel successfully knocked off few nuclear scientists by covert operations in past) pinpoints Israel as prime suspect. The fact that most of the killings of important commanders happened after Netanyahu's visit to USA and Fuad Shukr was also on the target list of USA due to 1983 Beirut Barrack bombing killings of 241 US Service members, creates a suspicion of a silent US hand or a clearance given to undertake such strikes. Its understandable that Ismail's assassination in Qatar, Egypt or Jordon would have been very uncomfortable to USA; hence Iran was the right place, from US perspective.\n\nThere are many theories about the methodology of assassination from a bomb planted months in advance and activated remotely through AI or IRGC narrative of strike by a short range projectile, but all indicate a major breach in Iranian security structure and a major embarrassment for Iran. It leaves Iran with no option but to take some action to prove its credibility to its proxies and domestic audience, which has taken a big hit by exposure of its vulnerability.\n\nHow Does The Situation Impacts Israel?\n\nFrom military perspective these assassinations have boosted sagging morale of IDF, extended political lifeline of Netanyahu, pushed all ceasefire proposals out of the window in near future, created do or die situation for all proxy fighters of Iran and put Iran's military credibility to a serious test. Netanyahu has every reason to pat his back and that of his agencies involved, but it might put the life of remaining hostages at grave risk. This aspect may cause some internal friction/dilemma with IDF, Mossad & many cabinet members pushing for ceasefire & release of hostages and Netanyahu with some hardliners pushing for prolonging war to achieve an impractical goal of \"Complete Destruction of Hamas\" as precondition to permanent ceasefire.\n\nIsrael is also communicating with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Bahrain to defend against the upcoming Iranian attack by allowing it to use their airspace and help in neutralising some projectiles. Prolonging the war and refusal to accept two state solution is also widening the gap between Netanyahu and Joe Biden, who finds himself getting increasingly and reluctantly involved to chase impractical goals of Netanyahu and his political survival.\n\nThe Iranian Options!\n\nThere is a wide asymmetry in conventional combat capability (including nuclear arsenal) of Israel backed by USA and Iran along with proxies, therefore Iran has been more comfortable in fighting a proxy war through his regional proxies instead of direct confrontation. Iran knows that an all-out war cannot give it any favourable outcome. Iran and Houthis don't have a land access to Israel; hence, they have very little option other than launching standoff attacks through missiles, drones and rockets of varying intensity, magnitude and impact.\n\nHezbollah is the only strong group which has some capability to fight an intense ground battle, but it's no match to the collective capability of Israel and US. It would therefore prefer standoff attacks and covert operations over conventional war. The capability of Hamas has been weakened considerably but it will continue small tactical clandestine actions against IDF under leadership of Yayha Sinwar, its leader in Gaza and one of the alleged planners of the October 7 terror attack on Israel, a hardliner, now appointed as the new head of its political bureau, replacing Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nThere are many backdoor negotiations going on and the fact that Iran has given adequate time to Israel and USA to prepare against its possible attack to minimise casualties, indicates that there could be a symbolic attack, bigger than its strike carried out in April 2024, in response to Israeli attack on its consulate in Syria, to satisfy its proxies and public. Hezbollah maintains that keeping Israel waiting is part of the punishment! In absence of credible options of all-out attack by Iran, it appears that the actual revenge could also come through some terrorist action/ clandestine operations/new hostage crisis, for which its proxies will be on look out for targets anywhere in the world as terrorism has no boundaries.\n\nAmerican Stakes!\n\nUSA has no choice but to defend strategic location of Israel, which is its most trusted ally, maintaining its strongest foothold in Middle East. Netanyahu continues to encash this strategic equation to fulfil his political agenda forcing USA to oblige, despite the optics of trying to control his overdrive/excesses by IDF, to amuse its domestic audience/voters and some allies not comfortable with excessive civilian casualties in Gaza. Simultaneously its still trying to push negotiations for ceasefire, release of hostages and its peace plan with all parties.\n\nUSA is sending more fighter planes, warships, and a carrier strike group to the Middle East. As per Pentagon, additional cruisers, destroyers, and a fighter squadron are part of the deployment, along with the carrier strike group USS Abraham Lincoln, to strengthen defences and assist Israel in its defence against a possible military attack by Iran and its proxies Hezbollah, Hamas and Houthis.\n\nOther Stake Holders?\n\nMeanwhile, as show of support, Russia had sent former Defence Minister and Head of National Security Council Sergei Shoigu to meet Iranian President Pezeshkian and counterparts to Tehran. Russia has reportedly started sending advanced air defence systems and radars to Iran and Iran has reportedly asked for Russian made Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets. Iran has deployed Russia's most powerful jamming communication system, Murmansk-BN, at strategically important locations. Reportedly President Putin too has asked Iran's Supreme leader for a restrained response to avoid civil casualties in Israel as Russia may not be keen to overstretch itself at this point of time.\n\nIran could count on political and diplomatic support from China and Russia at United Nations, which may not be not good enough to go for full blown war.\n\nTurkish President Erdogan made statements suggesting that Turkey could potentially intervene militarily in Israel to support of Palestinians, drawing parallels to his past interventions in Karabakh and Libya. His comments look more like political posturing than for real, as being a NATO member it may not be easy for him to do so, with USA standing firmly with Israel. Erdogan is using this opportunity to score a point in Islamic world. Turkey has stopped trade with Israel since May 2024 and might continue with such gestures. North Korean posturing seems to be more of optics at this stage.\n\nThe Arab world hasn't supported Palestinians beyond lip service in one of the worst humanitarian catastrophe and violations of IHL by Israel in response to brutal terror attack by Hamas on October 07; hence Iran can't expect any help from them. In fact many Arab countries might be happier with assassinations and embarrassment of Iran.\n\nWhat Happens to Gaza?\n\nIf Hezbollah launches offensive, Israel might be compelled to pull some more troops from Gaza, scale down combing operations and rely more on standoff strikes, as it has been doing in past. Indicators are that IDF is pushing for scaling down large scale operations in Gaza to specific int based targeting. Cease fire will be difficult in near term. Netanyahu's ambition of 'Greater Israel' will block any two state solution on some pretext or the other. Palestinians will continue to suffer due to lack of effective, sensible, moderate leadership, under uncontrolled Israel, backed by USA, and the global community not acting beyond lip service.\n\nUSA is trying for a two state solution independent of Hamas, with a puppet leader from Fatah to govern Gaza and West Bank, which is unlikely to be accepted by Israel as well as Hamas. Hamas, their quest for independent state and hatred towards Israel will not die down. The leaders will get replaced but the ideology will remain. The war even if sees some sort of conflict termination under brute pressure, its likely to continue in the mind of the Palestinian sufferers and radicalised terror groups, motivated to seek revenge through any means, anywhere in the world and is likely to erupt again in future.\n\nGlobal Impact\n\nIsrael Iran escalation will push the world further under inflationary pressure. Red Sea may become even more risky and shipping through Persian Gulf too may face serious threat. A disturbed oil flow may further cause price rise and turbulent economic environment. From Indian perspective initiatives like I2U2 and India- Middle East Europe Economic Corridor may get postponed indefinitely and Israel as one of Indian supplier of military hardware may face problems in meeting Indian supply orders. The global power blocks with Iran-Russia-China-North Korea and Syria getting closer to oppose USA, Israel and their Western Allies is an obvious outcome. Most importantly Iran's chances of going nuclear may increase much more, which may not be a good news for the region.", "source": {"uri": "moderndiplomacy.eu", "dataType": "news", "title": "Modern

Reuters\n\nLebanon-based Hezbollah appears to be advancing its plans to strike Israel independently of Iran. Tehran is still deciding on what its response strategy should be. Hezbollah, however, is moving much more rapidly.\n\nCNN cited one source familiar with the latest intelligence as saying that Hezbollah could potentially act within days. The same person said Iran has not yet completed all the preparations that the US would expect prior to a significant attack on Israel.\n\nThe news outlet quoted another source as saying that due to Lebanon's proximity to Israel, Hezbollah could launch an attack with minimal notice, unlike Iran, which would require more substantial preparations.\n\nThere is uncertainty regarding the level of coordination between Iran and Hezbollah, Iran's most influential proxy. The second source suggested that some officials believe the two entities may not be fully aligned on their strategies moving forward.\n\nThe urgency in Hezbollah's actions follows the killing of its top military commander, Fu'ad Shukr, by Israel in Lebanon last week. Additionally, Israel is widely believed to have assassinated Hamas' political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, although Israel has not confirmed or denied involvement.\n\nIn response to these developments, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) held an extraordinary meeting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to address the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nThe resulting draft communiqu\u00e9 condemned Israel's actions and reaffirmed solidarity with the Palestinian cause, specifically denouncing the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas leader and former Palestinian Prime Minister, in Tehran. The OIC labeled the act as a \"heinous crime\" and a violation of international law, warning that such actions undermine regional security and stability.\n\nMeanwhile, US President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have been actively engaging with Middle Eastern leaders, including those from Jordan, Qatar, and Egypt, emphasizing the need for de-escalation amid the rising tensions.This unfolding situation is being closely monitored by countries around the world, as the potential for conflict in the region grows.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Organisation of Islamic Cooperation"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeddah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeddah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jeddah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/08/Hezbollah-Israel-Iran-2024-08-25c1a43ff2f93c7a527928a7364b7f05.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799808", "eventUri": "eng-9799808", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2011-11-", "textStart": 143, "textEnd": 154}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

(Xinhua/Bilal Jawich)\n\nLOOMING REGIONAL ESCALATION\n\nOn July 30, Hezbollah senior military commander Fouad Shokor was killed in an attack on Beirut's southern suburbs.\n\nA day later, Hamas Politburo chief Ismail Haniyeh, who was in the Iranian capital of Tehran to attend the inauguration of Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian, was killed alongside his bodyguard when their residence was struck.\n\nIsrael has claimed responsibility for the killing of Shokor, but has not commented on the assassination of Haniyeh, which Hamas and Iran have attributed to Israel.\n\nRight after the killing of Haniyeh, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei vowed a \"harsh punishment\" for Israel. Earlier this week, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani vowed to take serious and deterrent action against Israel with \"strength and decisiveness,\" and rejected calls for negotiation. President Pezeshkian also said Israel would definitely receive the response to its \"crime and insolent\" move.\n\nAs for the death of Shokor, Hezbollah Leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah on Tuesday vowed an \"impactful and strong\" retaliation. \"We may choose to retaliate in cooperation with other resistance powers in Iran and Yemen or separately.\"\n\n\"The war has entered a new phase,\" Nasrallah said earlier, adding that the upcoming campaign will involve Iran, Yemen and Iraq, in addition to Gaza and Lebanon.\n\nHezbollah supporters listen to a televised speech given by Hezbollah Leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah during an event commemorating late military commander Fouad Shokor in Beirut, Lebanon, Aug. 6, 2024. (Xinhua/Bilal Jawich)\n\nOn Aug. 1, Yemen's Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi warned that the Houthi group will \"inevitably\" mount a military response to Israel's recent escalation.\n\nFor the expected retaliatory attack from Iran and its allies, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the Israeli forces were preparing for \"a swift transition to offense.\" The Israel Defense Forces stated that Chief of the General Staff Herzi Halevi has approved \"operational plans for various scenarios.\"\n\nMore American forces were moving to the region to bolster defenses in and around Israel. The United States was deploying additional warships, including a guided missile cruiser and missile destroyer, as well as another squadron of fighter jets, Israel's state-owned Kan TV news reported, adding that Britain is also expected to help protect Israel in case of an attack.\n\nTit-for-tat attacks between Israel and Hamas-backed armed groups remained intense and heavy following the death of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders. The Palestinian Health Ministry said at least eight Palestinians were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a vehicle carrying aid in central Gaza on Monday, and two more were killed and three others injured by the Israeli forces' bullets near the northern West Bank city of Jenin on Tuesday.\n\nPeople take part in a protest against the assassination of Hamas Politburo Chief Ismail Haniyeh in the West Bank city of Hebron, July 31, 2024. (Photo by Mamoun Wazwaz/Xinhua)\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli sources said a drone attack launched on Tuesday from Lebanon by Hezbollah forces injured six people in northern Israel, including one in critical condition.\n\nNegativity has already seeped into various facets of people's lives in the Middle East due to the prolonged regional conflict. The war-torn Gaza and southern Lebanon have been in the throes of a deepening water and electricity crisis.\n\nWith the Palestinian death toll from ongoing Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip nearing 40,000, the crossfire between relevant parties spreading from Gaza into the West Bank, and Iran and its allies' retaliation for Israel being touch and go, fears and anxiety among citizens of regional countries have mounted even more.\n\nSonic booms on Tuesday caused by Israeli warplanes breaking the sound barrier over Lebanon's capital of Beirut have prompted local residents to start packing and seek shelter in mountainous areas.\n\nIsraeli troops are seen during a military operation in Kafr Qud, near the West Bank city of Jenin, Aug. 6, 2024. (Photo by Ayman Nobani/Xinhua)\n\nConcerning the deteriorating regional security situation, T\u00fcrkiye, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Croatia, Slovenia, Norway and Sweden have all advised their citizens to leave Lebanon. Several French and Polish airlines have suspended flights to Lebanon.\n\nMeanwhile, a growing number of airlines, including Ryanair, Wizz Air, Lufthansa, Easyjet and Air India, have suspended flights to Israel due to concerns over instability.\n\nREGIONAL WAR BENEFITS NOBODY\n\nRegarding the heightening tension in the Middle East, Eyal Zisser, vice rector of Tel Aviv University and an expert on Middle Eastern Affairs, said the Iranian attacks would be \"limited\" and are not intended to start a regional war.\n\n\"Nobody is interested in a regional war. Nobody is going to gain anything from a regional war,\" he said.\n\n\"But once you start with retaliation, and you retaliate to the retaliation, and so on and so forth, the result can be that you lose control, and we eventually can find ourselves in a regional war. But that's not what all parties want right now,\" he noted. \"When you set up a fire, it's sometimes very difficult to keep the fire on a low level.\"\n\n\"Iran wants to respond to Israel's strikes, systematic assassinations, and the resumption of the assassination policy by Israel, but I think Iran does not want to expand the scope (of the conflict),\" said Hamid Faris, a professor of international relations at Egypt's Misr University for Science and Technology.\n\nNimrod Goren, a senior fellow for Israeli affairs at the Washington-based Middle East Institute, said, \"The fact that a regional war may be averted does not ensure that an Israel-Hezbollah flare-up will be prevented, and such an escalation will cause much damage in Israel and Lebanon, even without a regional war.\"\n\n\"Diplomatic efforts should be stepped up to find an off-ramp soon to the situation along the Israel-Lebanon border,\" he said.\n\nAbdullah Mahmoud, a Cairo-based researcher in Iranian affairs of the Middle East Forum for Strategic Studies and National Security, said, \"The attack this time will be a collaboration of attacks by different resistance movements.\"\n\n\"Hezbollah and Houthis will join the attack. I think there will be a high level of coordination among the resistance movements,\" he said.\n\nTen months after the outbreak of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on Oct. 7, 2023, escalating tension shows no end in sight. The spiral of violence has deeply undermined confidence in achieving peace.\n\nHowever, Goren believes \"achieving peace is possible, but is a longer-term goal.\"\n\n\"In the short term, a ceasefire and hostage release deal should be brokered between Israel and Hamas, then leveraged for defusing tensions along the Israel-Lebanon border, advancing the two-state solution, and promoting Israel-Saudi Arabia normalization,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "en.people.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "People's Daily, China"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This change in 'force posture' was not debated in Congress (nor is it even really being debated on the mainstream networks), despite that clearly US service members could soon find themselves in the middle of a war between Iran and Israel.\n\nThe White House has issued a fresh warning to Tehran on Thursday as it is said to still be gearing up for a strike on Israel in retaliation for the July 31st killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh at a residence in Tehran. The new warning from Washington includes both negative economic consequences and threats of destabilizing actions directed against the newly elected government of Masoud Pezeshkian.\n\n\"The United States has sent clear messaging to Iran that the risk of a major escalation if they do a significant retaliatory attack against Israel is extremely high,\" a US admin official told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe official further said that Tehran has been put on notice over \"a serious risk of consequences for Iran's economy and the stability of its newly elected government if it goes down that path.\"\n\nIs this a threat of regime change? To the ears of Iranian officials, it will sure sound like it given the country on its eastern border and the country on its western border were both regime-changed by Washington.\n\nCurrently, the consensus among US national security officials is that Hezbollah is likely to play a much bigger and coordinated role in any potential Iranian ballistic missile and drone attack on Israel:\n\nOfficials also don't know for sure whether Hezbollah plans to attack at the same time in a coordinated offensive with Iran or separately. Hezbollah has a large arsenal of missiles that can reach Israel and the concern is that the group and Iran might attack at the same time to try to overwhelm Israel's missile defenses.\n\n\"Last time we got more of a heads up, and this time people are making their best guesses,\" said a third U.S. official.\n\nBut while the US mainstream media narrative remains that it is exclusively Iran and its regional allies that are the regional 'aggressors' against Israel and the US, the fact remains that it is Israel which has attacked close Tehran ally Syria literally hundreds of times over the past years.\n\nAnd more recently, Israel attacked the Iranian embassy in Damascus (the aftermath which is pictured above). Nation-states did not attack each other's embassies even during World Wars I and II, and the strike on the diplomatic complex was unprecedented in history as an intentional act prior to Israel's April 1st operation in the Syrian capital.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_F-22_Raptor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stealth_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stealth technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regime_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Regime change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_strikes_in_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drone strikes in Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World War I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nation state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damascus"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Damascus"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Syria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2024-08/iranemb.jpg?h=cb0f308a&itok=IdOoTRAn", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799808", "eventUri": "eng-9799808", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 520, "textEnd": 529}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-01", "textStart": 2652, "textEnd": 2661}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

A large-scale intelligence effort is underway to identify the timing and nature of the response, according to the report.\n\nNasrallah said in a speech on Tuesday that the terror group will retaliate for the Shukr assassination. Several hours before the speech, Al Akhbar, a pro-Hezbollah newspaper in Beirut, published a front-page article suggesting that Hezbollah would likely target Tel Aviv.\n\nThe newspaper's editor-in-chief Ibrahim al-Amin wrote that Nasrallah believes there is maneuvering room in terms of Israeli civilians because civilians were killed during the Shukr strike in southern Beirut.\n\n\"If Hezbollah can choose targets, it is possible that it will target Tel Aviv and civilians might be harmed on the margins. The effective thing will be to hit a significant center of the organization that made the decision about the assassination [of Shukr] and took part in it,\" he wrote, as quoted by Axios on Wednesday.\n\nThere are several sensitive sites in the Tel Aviv area, including the headquarters of the Israel Defense Force and the Mossad, as well as several key military bases in the northern part of the city. The bases are all close to or within civilian neighborhoods.\n\nIsrael warns of severe consequences\n\nJerusalem is not interested in an all-out war with Hezbollah in Lebanon, but civilian casualties on the Israeli side would cross a red line, Axios reported on Wednesday, citing two Israeli officials.\n\nIDF and Israeli Defense Ministry officials have warned their counterparts at the Pentagon and U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) that since Hezbollah began its cross-border attacks on Oct. 8, its rocket fire has been inaccurate, according to the report.\n\nThis was highlighted by the Hezbollah rocket that hit a soccer pitch in the Golan Druze town of Majdal Shams last month, killing 12 children. Hezbollah's target had been a military base.\n\nThe Israeli officials said that the risk involved with long-range surface-to-surface missiles is greater as they carry much larger warheads, with the potential for many more civilian casualties.\n\n\"In the internal discussions with the U.S., Israel stressed that the cost of another Hezbollah mishap would be heavy and that Hezbollah would pay a disproportionate price if it harmed civilians as part of its retaliation,\" a senior Israeli official said.\n\nIran may be reconsidering its attack plans\n\nMeanwhile, Tehran is reportedly reconsidering its level of response against the backdrop of warnings that Israel will counter-attack strongly, Politico reported on Wednesday. The report also cited U.S. officials as saying that while Washington does expect an Iranian response, it might not happen in the near future.\n\nIntensive American diplomacy and an increased military posture in the Middle East may have also prompted Tehran to reconsider a major retaliatory strike against Israel, according to The Washington Post.\n\nAnother factor in Iran's decision-making may be new Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian.\n\nAccording to a report in the London-based Iran International, Pezeshkian has pleaded with Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to avoid a direct attack on Israel, warning that it could threaten his presidency and lead to devastation of Iran's infrastructure, energy and economy.\n\nPezeshkian reportedly told the supreme leader that a harsh Israeli counter-attack could lead to the collapse of the regime.\n\nHowever, \"Despite the grave warnings ... Khamenei remained noncommittal during the session, neither supporting nor opposing Pezeshkian's concerns,\" according to the report.\n\nIsrael continues preparations for attacks\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant visited IDF Home Front Command on Wednesday to discuss plans for warning citizens of any impending attack and giving emergency instructions to the public.\n\nOn Sunday, the Home Front Command unveiled a new technology to warn civilians in the case of a large-scale national emergency, similar to the U.S. Wireless Emergency Alerts system.\n\nThe \"personal message\" alert technology allows the army to notify all cell phones in a specific area without the need for any action on citizens' part. The warning notification will be immediately displayed on mobile phone screens, accompanied by a loud ringtone.\n\nHome Front Command has also moved search and rescue forces to Tel Aviv and other cities in preparation for potential Iranian and Hezbollah attacks, the IDF said on Tuesday.\n\nThe Ram Battalion (668) of the IDF's Search and Rescue Brigade (60th) has repositioned itself in Tel Aviv, the economic and cultural hub of Israel along the central Mediterranean coastline.\n\nThe Ram Battalion would respond to any building collapses or other destruction.\n\nAccording to the IDF, rapid rescue teams have also been deployed to Haifa, the Haifa bay area and several cities in the south and center of the country.\n\nSome Israeli municipalities are preparing to turn underground parking lots into emergency shelters in the event of a sustained wave of attacks from Iran and its terror proxies.\n\nDavid Aharoni, director of the security and emergency department at the Tel Aviv Municipality, told Channel 12 that residents are encouraged to first use the private shelters in the buildings, and then if they are outside, public shelters maintained by the municipality or in shelters in schools and community centers.", "source": {"uri": "tjpnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Texas Jewish Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashley_hughes@tjpnews.com", "name": "Ashley

Flights across Iran and its neighbors were cancelled amid fears that missiles could fly any moment, triggering a much-feared escalation of Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nWith his country on the brink of triggering a regional war, Iran's Acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri whispered to an aid bending close to catch his words.\n\nCameroon's foreign minister sat to Bagheri's right, Yemen's to his left, along with a room full of other foreign ministers from Muslim-majority countries, all there to help prevent the situation from spiraling into a wider conflict.\n\nSince Hamas's political chief Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran last week, the Islamic Republic's leaders have vowed vengeance against Israel, whom they claim was responsible. Israel hasn't confirmed or denied responsibility.\n\nThe unassuming venue for such a last-ditch effort to quell Iran's seething rage was the headquarters of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation's (OIC), modest by Saudi Arabia's rapidly modernizing and glitzy standards. It sits in a dusty, nondescript corner of the Red Sea city of Jeddah.\n\nThe play in the room, if it can be called that, was carefully articulated to CNN by Jordan's foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, who stepped out of the high stakes talks to promote the initiative his vulnerable kingdom is championing: \"The first step toward stopping the escalation is ending its root cause, which is the continued Israeli aggression on Gaza.\"\n\nThe thrust, to convince Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to soften his stance in ceasefire negotiations with Hamas, isn't new. But the payoff this time may be much more attractive than previous attempts.\n\nUnited States Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the US and its allies have communicated directly to both Israel and Iran that \"no one should escalate this conflict,\" adding that ceasefire negotiations have entered \"a final stage\" and could be jeopardized by further escalation elsewhere in the region.\n\nSafadi was in Tehran over the weekend and met both Bagheri and Iran's new President Masoud Pezeshkian, and appears to believe that Iran may be looking for an off ramp to escalation.\n\nIran needs diplomatic cover to back away from its hasty threats against Israel in the immediate aftermath of Haniyeh's killing: a Gaza ceasefire that would allow Tehran to claim it cares more for the lives of Palestinians in the Palestinian enclave than it does for taking revenge would fit the bill. But the payoff needs to be big enough for Iran as its honor and deterrence are at stake.\n\nFrance's President Emanuel Macron is adding his diplomatic heft, declaring in a phone call with Pezeshkian Wednesday, retaliation against Israel \"has to be abandoned\".\n\nPezeshkian's response suggests he is listening. \"If America and Western countries really want to prevent war and insecurity in the region, to prove this claim, they should immediately stop selling arms and supporting the Zionist regime and force this regime to stop the genocide and attacks on Gaza and accept a ceasefire,\" he said.\n\nCould Hezbollah act alone\n\nNearly ten months since Israel's war in Gaza, triggered by Hamas brutal October 7 attack which saw around 1200 people in Israel killed and at least 250 others taken hostage, almost 40,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Palestinian health officials - and there is still no end in sight to the conflict\n\nThe catch in the Gaza ceasefire escalation off-ramp play is that it is heavy on hope and short on substance.\n\nFor it to work, Netanyahu will have to buy in to it too.\n\nHamas just made this harder by replacing Haniyah with his tougher counterpart inside Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, an architect of the October 7 attacks, and anyway, right now they are in no mood for meaningful talks.\n\nThe change, if it's going to come, according to the consensus at the OIC has to be from the outside, from the only person who remotely has the clout to temper Netanyahu - US President Joe Biden.\n\nIranians attend the memorial procession of assassinated Hamas chief, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran, Iran, August 1, 2024.\n\nMajid Asgaripour/Reuters\n\nBut almost a year into the conflict, Biden refuses a showdown with Israel's most hardline, right-wing government in its history, that also adding to the frustrations in Jeddah.\n\nRiyad Mansour, Palestine's Permanent Observer at the UN, was in the room with Bagheri and the others.\n\n\"The region does not need escalation,\" he said \"What the region needs is a ceasefire. What the region needs to address legitimate rights. I have a feeling that Prime Minister Netanyahu wants to drag President Biden into a war with Iran\"\n\nWhat Bagheri did get in Jeddah was the kind of diplomatic support intended help get them off the ledge, with Mansour saying \"With regard to what Iran wanted about, you know, the respecting its territorial integrity and its sovereignty, there was, you know, a strong support to this sentiment.\"\n\nAs the acting Iranian foreign minister left for Tehran following the four-hour emergency meeting, focus shifted slightly back to Iran's Lebanese proxy Hezbollah, which is also intent on retaliation for the assassination of its top military commander Fu'ad Shukr in Beirut hours before Haniyeh's killing.\n\nOne US official and one western intelligence official told CNN that fears are higher now about Hezbollah taking action than Iran, raising the prospect that the Lebanon-based militia group may act without them.\n\nFor Netanyahu this may look like semantics intended to blunt Israel's desire for an overwhelming response against either aggressor.\n\nHe views Iran and Hezbollah as different hands of the same theological head.\n\nWith the exception of direct IranianIsraeli exchange of fire in April, Hezbollah has always landed the punches on Israel Iran hesitates to take, and may this time throw a double blow, one for Shukr and one for Hamas's Haniyeh.\n\nWere that the case Israel's retaliation against Hezbollah could just as quickly become the regional escalation dragging in Iran that everyone fears.\n\nWhat is clear, the Jeddah meet and the back channel diplomacy buys diplomatic space and time to develop an off ramp that has a least a little traction for now.\n\nBoth Iran and the US, to a degree, are buying in to it.\n\nWhether this fizzles out to another false horizon is with Bagheri and his president.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nic_robertson@cnn.com", "name": "Nic Robertson", "type":

The sequence of events indicates a more professional strategy of Israelis in targeting commanders of Iranian proxies, which is certainly better than mass punishments of Palestinians influenced by revenge psychosis, adopted so far. The ball is currently in the court of Iran, which is evaluating options to recover from the embarrassment of the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh on its soil as a guest.\n\nAlthough few interim exchanges have taken place between Hezbollah and Israel and a US strike on Iraqi non-state actors and retaliation in US bases post-assassination, these are routine exchanges as major retaliation is yet to come. The next move of Iran could shape the future escalation dynamics in the region.\n\nThe Assassination Drive\n\nWhile Israel may not own up its hand in the assassination of Hamas top political leader and negotiator Ismail Haniyeh, and the US has announced that it was neither informed nor is involved in it, the Iranians have assumed it was a successful covert operation by Mossad (Israel).\n\nWhile the ownership of the killing of Hezbollah's No. 2 Commander Fuad Shukr in Southern Beirut, Ali Nazih Abed Ali, a senior officer in Southwestern Lebanon, Hamas leader Mohammad Deif in Gaza, and some Iranian Republican Guard Corps (IRGC) commanders in Syria is well established, it's the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, which seems to be the most important trigger for escalation, where Israel is exercising the option of plausible deniability.\n\nThe Western media's initial narrative of internal feud within Hamas, with hardliners seeing Ismail as too moderate or Iran not being happy about Hamas handshake with Fatah in Beijing being cause of assassination, hasn't found any takers. The intention, benefits, and capacity to do so in the past (Israel has successfully knocked off a few nuclear scientists by covert operations in the past) pinpoint Israel as a prime suspect.\n\nThe fact that most of the killings of important commanders happened after Netanyahu's visit to the US and Fuad Shukr was also on the target list of the US due to the 1983 Beirut Barrack bombing (killing 241 US Service members) creates a suspicion of a silent US hand or a clearance given to undertake such strikes. It's understandable that Ismail's assassination in Qatar, Egypt, or Jordan would have been very uncomfortable for the US; hence Iran was the right place, from a US perspective.\n\nThere are many theories about the methodology of assassination from a bomb planted months in advance and activated remotely through AI or, as given by the IRGC narrative, strike by a short-range projectile, but all indicate a major breach in Iranian security structure and a major embarrassment for Tehran. It leaves Iran with no option but to take some action to prove its credibility to its proxies and domestic audience, which has taken a big hit by exposure of its vulnerability.\n\nImpact on Israel\n\nFrom a military perspective, these assassinations have boosted the sagging morale of the IDF, extended the political lifeline of Netanyahu, pushed all ceasefire proposals out of the window in the near future, created a do-or-die situation for all proxy fighters of Iran, and put Tehran's military credibility to a serious test.\n\nNetanyahu has every reason to pat his back and that of his agencies involved, but it might put the lives of remaining hostages at grave risk. This aspect may cause some internal friction/dilemma with the IDF, Mossad, and many cabinet members pushing for a ceasefire and release of hostages, and Netanyahu, with some hardliners pushing for prolonging war to achieve an impractical goal of \" complete destruction of Hamas\" as a precondition to a permanent ceasefire.\n\nIsrael is also communicating with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Bahrain to defend against the upcoming Iranian attack by allowing it to use their airspace and help in neutralising some projectiles. Prolonging the war and refusing to accept a two-state solution is also widening the gap between Netanyahu and Joe Biden, who finds himself getting increasingly and reluctantly involved to chase the impractical goals of Netanyahu and his political survival.\n\nThe Iranian Options\n\nThere is a wide asymmetry in conventional combat capability (including nuclear arsenal) of Israel backed by the US and Iran along with proxies; therefore, Iran has been more comfortable fighting a proxy war through its regional proxies instead of direct confrontation. Iran knows that an all-out war cannot give it any favourable outcome. Iran and the Houthis don't have land access to Israel; hence, they have very little option other than launching standoff attacks through missiles, drones, and rockets of varying intensity, magnitude, and impact.\n\nHezbollah is the only strong group that has some capability to fight an intense ground battle, but it's no match to the collective capability of Israel and the US. It would therefore prefer standoff attacks and covert operations over conventional war. The capability of Hamas has been weakened considerably, but it will continue small tactical clandestine actions against IDF under the leadership of Yayha Sinwar, its leader in Gaza and one of the alleged planners of the October 7 terror attack on Israel, a hardliner now appointed as the new head of its political bureau, replacing Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nThere are many backdoor negotiations going on, and the fact that Iran has given adequate time to Israel and the US to prepare against its possible attack to minimise casualties indicates that there could be a symbolic attack, bigger than its strike carried out in April 2024, in response to Israeli attack on its consulate in Syria, to satisfy its proxies and public. Hezbollah maintains that keeping Israel waiting is part of the punishment! In the absence of credible options of an all-out attack by Iran, it appears that the actual revenge could also come through some terrorist action, clandestine operations, or new hostage crisis, for which its proxies will be on the lookout for targets anywhere in the world as terrorism has no boundaries.\n\nAmerican Stakes\n\nThe US has no choice but to defend the strategic location of Israel, which is its most trusted ally, maintaining its strongest foothold in the Middle East. Netanyahu continues to encash this strategic equation to fulfil his political agenda, forcing the US to oblige, despite the optics of trying to control his overdrive/excesses by the IDF, to amuse its domestic audience/voters and some allies not comfortable with excessive civilian casualties in Gaza. Simultaneously, it's still trying to push negotiations for a ceasefire, the release of hostages, and its peace plan with all parties.\n\nThe USA is sending more fighter planes, warships, and a carrier strike group to the Middle East. As per the Pentagon, additional cruisers, destroyers, and a fighter squadron are part of the deployment, along with the carrier strike group USS Abraham Lincoln, to strengthen defences and assist Israel in its defence against a possible military attack by Iran and its proxies Hezbollah, Hamas, and Houthis.\n\nOther Stakeholders\n\nMeanwhile, as a show of support, Russia had sent former Defence Minister and Head of National Security Council Sergei Shoigu to meet Iranian President Pezeshkian and counterparts in Tehran. Russia has reportedly started sending advanced air defence systems and radars to Iran, and Iran has reportedly asked for Russian-made Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets. Iran has deployed Russia's most powerful jamming communication system, Murmansk-BN, at strategically important locations. Reportedly, President Vladimir Putin too has asked Iran's Supreme Leader for a restrained response to avoid civil casualties in Israel, as Russia may not be keen to overstretch itself at this point in time.\n\nIran could count on political and diplomatic support from China and Russia at the United Nations, which may not be good enough to go for full-blown war.\n\nTurkish President Recep Erdogan made statements suggesting that Turkey could potentially intervene militarily to support Palestinians, drawing parallels to his past interventions in Karabakh and Libya. His comments look more like political posturing than for real; as a NATO member, it may not be easy for him to do so, with the US standing firmly with Israel. Erdogan is using this opportunity to score a point in the Islamic world. Turkey has stopped trade with Israel since May 2024 and might continue with such gestures. North Korean posturing seems to be more of an optics at this stage.\n\nThe Arab world hasn't supported Palestinians beyond lip service in one of the worst humanitarian catastrophes and violations of international humanitarian law by Israel in response to a brutal terror attack by Hamas on October 7; hence, Iran can't expect any help from them. In fact, many Arab countries might be happier with these assassinations leading to the embarrassment of Iran.\n\nFuture of Gaza\n\nIf Hezbollah launches an offensive, Israel might be compelled to pull some more troops from Gaza, scale down combing operations, and rely more on standoff strikes, as it has been doing in the past. Indicators are that IDF is pushing for scaling down large-scale operations in Gaza to specific intelligence-based targeting. Ceasefire will be difficult in the near term. Netanyahu's ambition of 'Greater Israel' will block any two-state solution on some pretext or the other. Palestinians will continue to suffer due to a lack of effective, sensible, moderate leadership, under uncontrolled Israel, backed by the US, and the global community not acting beyond lip service.\n\nThe US is trying for a two-state solution independent of Hamas, with a puppet leader from Fatah to govern Gaza and the West Bank, which is unlikely to be accepted by Israel as well as Hamas. Hamas, their quest for an independent state and hatred towards Israel will not die down. The leaders will get replaced, but the ideology will remain.\n\nGlobal Impact\n\nIsrael-Iran escalation will push the world further under inflationary pressure. The Red Sea may become even more risky, and shipping through the Persian Gulf too may face a serious threat. A disturbed oil flow may further cause price rises and a turbulent economic environment. From an Indian perspective, initiatives like I2U2 (Israel, Iran, the UAE, and the US) and the India-Middle East Europe Economic Corridor may get postponed indefinitely. Israel, as one of the suppliers of military hardware to India, may face problems in meeting Indian supply orders. The global power blocks with Iran, Russia, China, North Korea, and Syria getting closer to oppose the US, Israel, and their Western allies are an obvious outcome. Most importantly, Iran's chances of going nuclear may increase much more, which may not be good news for the region.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"},

Iran and Hezbollah have both vowed to retaliate against Israel over the assassinations, though it remains unclear when or how they'll strike back.\n\nNew reporting suggests Tehran, which wants to avoid a wider war, may not pursue a large-scale response and could take a more limited approach -- such as targeting Mossad. And the US has reportedly warned Iran that its new government and economy would be at \"serious risk\" if it moves forward with a significant attack against the Jewish state.\n\nBut Gregory Brew, an Iran expert at Eurasia Group, says he hasn't seen anything from the Iranian side to back up the notion Tehran is planning to \"scale back its response.\"\n\n\"It's not at all unusual that Iran is taking its time before responding, as it did in April when it waited two full weeks,\" says Brew, referencing the massive barrage of missiles and drones Iran fired at Israel in retaliation for a deadly strike on its Damascus consulate.\n\nThe April attack was overwhelmingly intercepted by Israel and its allies. Had there been heavy civilian casualties, it's possible an all-out war could've broken out in the region.\n\nHowever they move forward in the days ahead, both Iran and Hezbollah are \"likely to avoid causing significant civilian casualties, which Israel has indicated as a red line,\" says Brew, because neither wants to end up in a wider war. But it's a \"tough line for Iran and Hezbollah to walk, and if the attacks do cause more damage than anticipated, there will be pressure within Israel to respond in kind, raising the risks of a broader regional escalation that could potentially pull in the US,\" adds Brew.\n\nHezbollah has pledged to retaliate with or without allies.

However, she is not in charge of U.S. foreign policy. Biden is still running that, and he still seems incapable of saying no to Israel no matter what it does.\n\nWhat Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is doing at the moment is systematically crossing the \"red lines\" laid down by Israel's most dangerous enemies, Iran and its proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn conventional military terms, that doesn't make sense.\n\nThe Israel Defence Forces are already heavily engaged in fighting Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Israeli troops are tired, and the economy is suffering from the repeated call-ups of reservists. The army doesn't want to open up another front.\n\nHezbollah and the Israeli army have been involved in a low-intensity exchange of rockets and artillery fire across Israel's northern border ever since Hamas' attack on Israel last October. However, the targets on both sides were limited to the first 20 kilometres beyond the border, where most civilians have been evacuated. No attacks on Beirut, no attacks on Tel Aviv.\n\nIran, with 90 million people and an Islamist government, could be an existential threat to Israel if it had nuclear weapons, but it has deliberately stopped just short of that technology. It supports various Arab members of the \"Axis of Resistance\" with money and weapons, but it avoids direct clashes with Israel and the two do not have a common border.\n\nSo it is obviously in Israel's interest to maintain the status quo with Hezbollah and Iran -- and yet Netanyahu has begun trying to undermine it.\n\nHis first initiative was a missile strike four months ago that killed two Iranian generals and five other officers who were in Syria. Israel often \"deniably\" assassinates Iranian officers, officials and scientists, but this was a direct challenge that was certain to evoke an Iranian military response.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nNeither Teheran nor Washington wanted to get drawn into a war, however, so they co-ordinated a charade in which Iran launched 300 missiles and drones against Israel but all of them were shot down or missed their targets. Honour was satisfied, Netanyahu was thwarted and nobody died.\n\nBut then in July Biden pulled out of the presidential race, Harris became the candidate, and the prospect of a less blindly supportive U.S. ally loomed on the horizon. How best to ensure that Harris doesn't win and Netanyahu's friend Donald Trump becomes president instead? Drag the U.S. into a war with Iran before the election.\n\nA pretext for that soon presented itself in the form of a random Hezbollah missile in the usual tit-for-tat along the Israeli-Lebanese border that killed a dozen young Druze who were playing soccer. It wasn't unusual and it probably wasn't even deliberately targeted at the football field, but it gave Netanyahu the excuse he needed.\n\nOn the night of July 30-31 Israeli missiles flew to Beirut, Hezbollah's red line, to kill Fuad Shukr, Hezbollah's second-in-command. Only hours later an Israeli missile or bomb (accounts vary) killed Hamas's political head, Ismail Haniyeh -- and it killed him in Tehran, to ensure that Iran also felt obliged to retaliate.\n\nTo people unfamiliar with the way the game is played in the Middle East this account may sound paranoid, or even specifically anti-Israeli. It is not. I offer in defence the analysis by Alon Pinkas in the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz on Aug. 1.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Israel could have killed Haniyeh anywhere in the Middle East, yet chose to do so in Tehran during the inauguration of the new president ... Israel left Tehran no alternative but to retaliate.\n\n\"Who has no interest in such an escalation? The United States, whose makeshift Middle East policy will now have to be revisited, and Iran, which clearly prefers attrition and low intensity.\n\n\"Who does have a vested interest in an expanded war? Mr. Netanyahu. Which is why the conventional wisdom in Washington over the last 36 hours is that Israel carried out the Haniyeh assassination deliberately in Iran and intentionally on that day.\"\n\nAnd what is dear old Biden doing? He's sending another aircraft carrier to the eastern Mediterranean to \"defend Israel\" (and maybe fight Iran) when he should be using the leverage of the $6.5 billion of extra military aid Washington has sent Israel since last October to force a ceasefire in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "thespec.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thespec.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gwynne_dyer@thespec.com", "name":

However, the US has pledged to intervene directly to protect Israel, as it did in April, and if the situation turns into a full-blown Iran-Israel war, the US would almost certainly be directly involved.\n\nThe US officials said they don't have a clear picture of when Iran will launch its reprisal attack or how extensive it will be.

Michael Kurilla, the head of U.S. Central Command, has already arrived in the Middle East for a preplanned visit expected to center around mobilizing a broad regional and international coalition to protect and advance Israel's interests.\n\nWhile Israel has not yet confirmed nor denied the strike on Haniyeh, it did admit to ending the life of Shukr, who is blamed for killing 12 minors on a soccer field in the Golan Heights in a recent attack.\n\nIran promised to retaliate within 72 hours, which did not end up happening. However, reports indicate that Iran could strike at any moment with \"imminent\" plans for retaliation.\n\nIt is expected that Tehran's response will mirror the response from back in April following West Jerusalem's alleged bombing of the Iranian consulate in Syria. Iran deployed hundreds of drones and missiles, but Israel reported minimal damage from the retaliatory attack.\n\n(Related: Check out our earlier coverage to learn more about \"Tehran's duty\" to seek \"revenge for Ismail Haniyeh's blood.\")\n\nChances are that Iran's retaliatory attack this time around will be much larger than the last one. Officials are expecting something bigger that could include Hezbollah forces in Lebanon, seeing as how Iran is promising that the \"entire Resistance Axis\" will participate this time in striking Israel.\n\nIt remains an uncertainty whether there will be coordinated or separate strikes from Iran and Hezbollah. Those plans are still being finalized and should be apparent in the coming days.\n\nThe Biden regime is reportedly in a panic over the situation as it believes both Washington and West Jerusalem will face a much more difficult situation this time around as Iran will more than likely launch a much bigger assault.\n\nThe purpose of the coalition and Kurilla's efforts to mobilize it with haste is to keep Iran at bay while still protecting Israel from having to face the music for its continued aggression.\n\n\"Netanyahu deliberately stirs up trouble against Iran expecting his vassal United States to protect Israel from retaliation as was done earlier when Iran lurched over 300 missiles and rockets against Israel for other assassinations,\" one commenter wrote.\n\n\"Their intent is to drag the U.S. into a war against Iran that will destabilize the Middle East.\"\n\nAnother wrote that this next war is \"the last war\" that will ultimately \"bring down the Western world hegemony\" ... \"not the Chinese forces and not the Russian forces will be able to fight this war against the world hegemony.\"\n\n\"When Hezbollah and Iran are fighting, they just need to provide weapons and think tanks that are already experienced in wars. If Israel collapses, their control will be in just the West ... BRICS will have the rest of the world and create a new world order that will bring peace and prosperity, equality, respect, and mutual growth within this new world order.\"\n\nAnother asked why the U.S. armed forces have suddenly decided to openly play \"mercenary service for the defense of Israel.\"\n\n\"I thought their allegiance was to the American people and their flag?\" this person continued, referring to the U.S. military. \"And then they come home acting as heroes and wanting free coffees.\"\n\n\"Imagine of the U.S. loses the Ukraine proxy war followed by losing Israel,\" wrote another. \"That is the end of the empire.\"\n\nThe latest news about the dire situation in the Middle East can be found at Chaos.news.", "source": {"uri": "naturalnews.com", "dataType": "news",

Israel was immediately blamed for the assassination after pledging to kill Haniyeh and other Hamas leaders over the terrorist group's Oct. 7 attack on the Jewish state, which killed 1,200 people and saw hundreds more taken hostage.\n\nNETANYAHU APOLOGIZES FOR OCT. 7 HAMAS ATTACKS, WARNS ISRAEL NOW FACES 'FULL-FLEDGED IRANIAN AXIS'\n\nHaniyeh had been in Tehran for the swearing-in ceremony of Iran's newly-elected president, Masoud Pezeshkian.\n\nIran has signaled its intention to strike back at Israel, though the exact scope and timing of a potential attack are not clear. That's in contrast to Iran's highly anticipated missile and drone attack on Israel in April in retaliation for Israel killing a senior Iranian paramilitary commander in Syria.\n\nAnother variable at play is the Iranian proxy terrorist group Hezbollah, which has in recent months been escalating attacks on Israel near its border with Lebanon.\n\nEarlier this week, Israel said it carried out an airstrike in southern Lebanon, killing four Hezbollah fighters.\n\nTAYLOR SWIFT PLOT: SUSPECT WHO PLEDGED ALLEGIANCE TO ISIS HAD CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES, DEVICES AT HOME\n\nU.S. officials have insisted that warnings to Iran concern the risks of provoking a military response from Israe and deepening the conflict, and not potential U.S. military action, per the Journal.\n\nThese developments come as Qatari, Egyptian and U.S. leaders have urged Israel to resume talks with Hamas Aug. 15.\n\n\"It is time to conclude a cease-fire agreement and release hostages and prisoners,\" a joint statement from the three countries Thursday sid.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will send a negotiating team Aug. 15 to finalize the details of the Gaza cease-fire framework.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe mediators said the talks would take place either in Qatar's capital of Doha or Egypt's capital of Cairo. Last week's killing of Haniyeh was widely seen as a blow to cease-fire talks.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "wfin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFIN"},

Moreover, that course has stymied Mr. Biden's demands that a cease-fire be reached in Gaza this month.\n\nWith Iran and Hezbollah, Tehran's well-armed proxy in Lebanon, promising retaliation for last week's assassinations of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah military commander Fouad Shukur in Beirut, Israelis are living with the threat of a devastating attack coming at any moment.\n\nIn response to the daily assertions that retaliation is coming, the Israeli government has advised the United States that any targeting of civilians will be met with a \"disproportionate\" response, U.S. officials have said.\n\nIn this tense climate, the U.S. is not wavering from its full support for Israeli security, and is positioning additional military assets in the region and coordinating with the coalition of countries that sprang to Israel's defense in April.\n\nBut privately U.S. officials express frustration that, as they see it, Israel has been taking actions with the effect of undermining U.S. goals - while knowing the U.S. will come to its defense if those actions provoke a military response.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Biden's exasperation with Mr. Netanyahu exploded in a recent phone call between the two, when the president reportedly shouted at the Israeli prime minister and told him in heated undiplomatic terms to stop misleading him.\n\nIn this context, the Biden administration's nonstop diplomatic efforts might seem doomed.\n\nBut diplomacy does still have a chance, some regional analysts say: Not solely or perhaps even primarily as a manifestation of U.S. power in the region, but because no one, least of all Iran, wants to trigger a costly war.\n\n\"All the indications are that no one - not Iran, not Hezbollah, not Israel - wants a devastating and unpredictable war right now,\" says Hanin Ghaddar, Friedmann fellow in Middle East affairs at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n\n\"If Iran ends up responding in a way that Israel can tolerate,\" she adds, \"then I think there is still room for a bigger role for diplomacy.\"\n\nOthers say the U.S. must press forward with diplomacy to avert escalation - with the long-term goal being to allow the U.S. to reduce its Middle East footprint.\n\n\"Policymakers in Washington should do everything possible to prevent the outbreak of a full-scale regional war\" in the Middle East, says Michael DiMino, a former CIA counterterrorism officer who is now a fellow at Defense Priorities, a Washington think tank promoting restraint in U.S. foreign policy.\n\nSuch a conflict \"would not serve the security interests of the United States, Israel, or the world,\" he says.\n\nNo one thinks Iran and Hezbollah can be dissuaded from taking some retaliatory action in response to the assassinations. But days have gone by without Iranian missiles or attack drones flying - after Secretary of State Antony Blinken told his G7 counterparts Sunday to expect the retaliation within 48 hours. And that suggests to some administration officials and experts that intense diplomatic contacts and back-channel communications with Iran are slowing and modifying the response.\n\nAt an emergency meeting Wednesday of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Iran's acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani said his country would respond to Mr. Haniyeh's killing on its territory at \"the right time\" and in an \"appropriate\" manner.\n\nAnd in a speech Tuesday commemorating Mr. Shukur, Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah said his organization is \"committed to responding\" to the recent assassinations. Insisting \"it will come,\" he also asserted that \"Israel's week-long wait is part of the punishment.\"\n\nBut Ms. Ghaddar says there are good reasons to think every party involved wants to avoid an unpredictable escalation right now.\n\n\"Iran cannot afford a war,\" she says, underscoring the country's weak economy, a government still in formation after recent elections, and a national priority of protecting an advancing nuclear program.\n\nHezbollah, she adds, is keen to end what she calls the \"daily\" erosion of its military officer corps in Israeli attacks.\n\n\"They are desperate to stop the bleeding,\" she says. \"So I would think they will go with a response that will be enough to tell their people they avenged these deaths,\" she adds, \"but one that will still leave room for diplomacy to get to a cease-fire.\"\n\nNoting further that Mr. Nasrallah has said Hezbollah would act alone if it had to, she says, \"Especially in light of Israel's preemptive actions, they don't have the luxury of delaying it [retaliation] much longer.\"\n\nAs for Israel, she says, \"Despite the boldness we've seen recently, they don't want a wider war either.\n\n\"They've been at war for 10 months now,\" she adds, \"so they want to restock and rest up before they would go into Lebanon\" after Hezbollah.\n\nEven amid the nervous waiting game, U.S. officials continue to insist that a Gaza cease-fire remains just inches away, as Mr. Blinken said again this week.\n\nSpeaking with reporters Wednesday, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said that despite rising tensions, the parties to the cease-fire negotiations \"are as close as we think we have ever been\" to a deal.\n\nMr. Kirby refused to comment on recent reports of Mr. Biden's frustrations with Mr. Netanyahu or White House suspicions that the Israeli leader is playing on the president's loyalties to Israel while offering nothing in return.\n\nBut he did venture to cast the blame for the lack of a cease-fire in Gaza on both Hamas and Israel, despite White House insistence months ago that Israel was fully on board.\n\n\"The deal hasn't been accepted,\" Mr. Kirby said, \"because neither side has signed up to it.\"", "source": {"uri": "csmonitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Science Monitor"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christian_science_monitor@csmonitor.com", "name": "Christian Science

Therefore, we will not allow Hezbollah terrorists to destabilize the border and the region.\n\nIf Hezbollah continues its aggression, Israel will fight it, with all its might.\n\nRemember Nasrallah's regret following the dangerous and miscalculated adventure he embarked on, in August 2006 - learn the lesson of the past so as not to fall into a dangerous scenario in August 2024.\n\n\"He who plays with fire may expect destruction\" [translated from an Arabic saying].\n\nThe United States warned Iran that it would suffer a devastating blow if it launches a major attack on Israel. The warning has been conveyed to Tehran both directly and through intermediaries, a US official said without elaborating.\n\n\"The United States has sent clear messaging to Iran that the risk of a major escalation if they use Hezbollah and other proxies create a significant retaliatory attack against Israel is extremely high.\"\n\nThe U.S. official stated that the U.S. military would not remain passive. That the United States now has 4 aircraft carriers, dozens of ships and hundreds of combat jets ready to respond.\n\nAn Israeli security source stated: \"If Iran believes that they can slaughter 1,200 innocent Israeli citizens via Hamas on October 7, murder Druze and Christian children and walk away from more terror attacks, they are very wrong. We will turn Tehran into a parking lot without cars. Iran, which is the third-largest oil reserve holder in the world will have no oil after an attack on Israel.\"", "source": {"uri": "israelnewsagency.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Israel News Agency"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sectarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arabic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hassan Nasrallah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proxy war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Druze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israelis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://israelnewsagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/lebanon_bombed_aug24.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799808", "eventUri": "eng-9799808", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-10-07", "textStart": 1598, "textEnd": 1607}, {"amb": false, "date": "2006-08-", "textStart": 660, "textEnd": 671}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

But could Tehran instead be prepared to pull back in exchange for progress on Gaza peace talks? That was the hope among regional leaders gathered at an emergency summit in Jeddah.\n\nIt was Wednesday and the world was on edge. Flights across Iran and its neighbors were cancelled amid fears that missiles could fly any moment, triggering a much-feared escalation of Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nWith his country on the brink of triggering a regional war, Iran's Acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri whispered to an aid bending close to catch his words.\n\nCameroon's foreign minister sat to Bagheri's right, Yemen's to his left, along with a room full of other foreign ministers from Muslim-majority countries, all there to help prevent the situation from spiraling into a wider conflict.\n\nSince Hamas's political chief Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran last week, the Islamic Republic's leaders have vowed vengeance against Israel, whom they claim was responsible. Israel hasn't confirmed or denied responsibility.\n\nThe unassuming venue for such a last-ditch effort to quell Iran's seething rage was the headquarters of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation's (OIC), modest by Saudi Arabia's rapidly modernizing and glitzy standards. It sits in a dusty, nondescript corner of the Red Sea city of Jeddah.\n\nThe play in the room, if it can be called that, was carefully articulated to CNN by Jordan's foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, who stepped out of the high stakes talks to promote the initiative his vulnerable kingdom is championing: \"The first step toward stopping the escalation is ending its root cause, which is the continued Israeli aggression on Gaza.\"\n\nThe thrust, to convince Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to soften his stance in ceasefire negotiations with Hamas, isn't new. But the payoff this time may be much more attractive than previous attempts.\n\nUnited States Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the US and its allies have communicated directly to both Israel and Iran that \"no one should escalate this conflict,\" adding that ceasefire negotiations have entered \"a final stage\" and could be jeopardized by further escalation elsewhere in the region.\n\nSafadi was in Tehran over the weekend and met both Bagheri and Iran's new President Masoud Pezeshkian, and appears to believe that Iran may be looking for an off ramp to escalation.\n\nIran needs diplomatic cover to back away from its hasty threats against Israel in the immediate aftermath of Haniyeh's killing: a Gaza ceasefire that would allow Tehran to claim it cares more for the lives of Palestinians in the Palestinian enclave than it does for taking revenge would fit the bill. But the payoff needs to be big enough for Iran as its honor and deterrence are at stake.\n\nFrance's President Emanuel Macron is adding his diplomatic heft, declaring in a phone call with Pezeshkian Wednesday, retaliation against Israel \"has to be abandoned\".\n\nPezeshkian's response suggests he is listening. \"If America and Western countries really want to prevent war and insecurity in the region, to prove this claim, they should immediately stop selling arms and supporting the Zionist regime and force this regime to stop the genocide and attacks on Gaza and accept a ceasefire,\" he said.\n\nNearly ten months since Israel's war in Gaza, triggered by Hamas brutal October 7 attack which saw around 1200 people in Israel killed and at least 250 others taken hostage, almost 40,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Palestinian health officials - and there is still no end in sight to the conflict\n\nThe catch in the Gaza ceasefire escalation off-ramp play is that it is heavy on hope and short on substance.\n\nFor it to work, Netanyahu will have to buy in to it too.\n\nHamas just made this harder by replacing Haniyah with his tougher counterpart inside Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, an architect of the October 7 attacks, and anyway, right now they are in no mood for meaningful talks.\n\nThe change, if it's going to come, according to the consensus at the OIC has to be from the outside, from the only person who remotely has the clout to temper Netanyahu - US President Joe Biden.\n\nBut almost a year into the conflict, Biden refuses a showdown with Israel's most hardline, right-wing government in its history, that also adding to the frustrations in Jeddah.\n\nRiyad Mansour, Palestine's Permanent Observer at the UN, was in the room with Bagheri and the others.\n\n\"The region does not need escalation,\" he said \"What the region needs is a ceasefire. What the region needs to address legitimate rights. I have a feeling that Prime Minister Netanyahu wants to drag President Biden into a war with Iran\"\n\nWhat Bagheri did get in Jeddah was the kind of diplomatic support intended help get them off the ledge, with Mansour saying \"With regard to what Iran wanted about, you know, the respecting its territorial integrity and its sovereignty, there was, you know, a strong support to this sentiment.\"\n\nAs the acting Iranian foreign minister left for Tehran following the four-hour emergency meeting, focus shifted slightly back to Iran's Lebanese proxy Hezbollah, which is also intent on retaliation for the assassination of its top military commander Fu'ad Shukr in Beirut hours before Haniyeh's killing.\n\nOne US official and one western intelligence official told CNN that fears are higher now about Hezbollah taking action than Iran, raising the prospect that the Lebanon-based militia group may act without them.\n\nFor Netanyahu this may look like semantics intended to blunt Israel's desire for an overwhelming response against either aggressor.\n\nHe views Iran and Hezbollah as different hands of the same theological head.\n\nWith the exception of direct IranianIsraeli exchange of fire in April, Hezbollah has always landed the punches on Israel Iran hesitates to take, and may this time throw a double blow, one for Shukr and one for Hamas's Haniyeh.\n\nWere that the case Israel's retaliation against Hezbollah could just as quickly become the regional escalation dragging in Iran that everyone fears.\n\nWhat is clear, the Jeddah meet and the back channel diplomacy buys diplomatic space and time to develop an off ramp that has a least a little traction for now.\n\nBoth Iran and the US, to a degree, are buying in to it.\n\nWhether this fizzles out to another false horizon is with Bagheri and his president.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

A large-scale intelligence effort is underway to identify the timing and nature of the response, according to the report.\n\nNasrallah said in a speech on Tuesday that the terror group will retaliate for the Shukr assassination. Several hours before the speech, Al Akhbar, a pro-Hezbollah newspaper in Beirut, published a front-page article suggesting that Hezbollah would likely target Tel Aviv.\n\nThe newspaper's editor-in-chief Ibrahim al-Amin wrote that Nasrallah believes there is maneuvering room in terms of Israeli civilians because civilians were killed during the Shukr strike in southern Beirut.\n\n\"If Hezbollah can choose targets, it is possible that it will target Tel Aviv and civilians might be harmed on the margins. The effective thing will be to hit a significant center of the organization that made the decision about the assassination [of Shukr] and took part in it,\" he wrote, as quoted by Axios on Wednesday.\n\nThere are several sensitive sites in the Tel Aviv area, including the headquarters of the Israel Defense Force and the Mossad, as well as several key military bases in the northern part of the city. The bases are all close to or within civilian neighborhoods.\n\nIsrael warns of severe consequences\n\nJerusalem is not interested in an all-out war with Hezbollah in Lebanon, civilian casualties on the Israeli side would cross a red line, Axios reported on Wednesday, citing two Israeli officials.\n\nIDF and Israeli Defense Ministry officials have warned their counterparts at the Pentagon and U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) that since Hezbollah began its cross-border attacks on Oct. 8, its rocket fire has been inaccurate, according to the report.\n\nThis was highlighted by the Hezbollah rocket that hit a soccer pitch in the Golan Druze town of Majdal Shams last month, killing 12 children. Hezbollah's target had been a military base.\n\nThe Israeli officials said that the risk involved with long-range surface-to-surface missiles is greater as they carry much larger warheads, with the potential for many more civilian casualties.\n\n\"In the internal discussions with the U.S., Israel stressed that the cost of another Hezbollah mishap would be heavy and that Hezbollah would pay a disproportionate price if it harmed civilians as part of its retaliation,\" a senior Israeli official said.\n\nIran may be reconsidering its attack plans\n\nMeanwhile, Tehran is reportedly reconsidering its level of response against the backdrop of warnings that Israel will counter-attack strongly, Politico reported on Wednesday. The report also cited U.S. officials as saying that while Washington does expect an Iranian response, it might not happen in the near future.\n\nIntensive American diplomacy and an increased military posture in the Middle East may have also prompted Tehran to reconsider a major retaliatory strike against Israel, according to The Washington Post.\n\nAnother factor in Iran's decision-making may be new Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian.\n\nAccording to a report in the London-based Iran International, Pezeshkian has pleaded with Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to avoid a direct attack on Israel, warning that it could threaten his presidency and lead to devastation of Iran's infrastructure, energy and economy.\n\nPezeshkian reportedly told the supreme leader that a harsh Israeli counter-attack could lead to the collapse of the regime.\n\nHowever, \"Despite the grave warnings ... Khamenei remained noncommittal during the session, neither supporting nor opposing Pezeshkian's concerns,\" according to the report.\n\nIsrael continues preparations for attacks\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant visited IDF Home Front Command on Wednesday to discuss plans for warning citizens of any impending attack and giving emergency instructions to the public.\n\nOn Sunday, the Home Front Command unveiled a new technology to warn civilians in the case of a large-scale national emergency, similar to the U.S. Wireless Emergency Alerts system.\n\nThe \"personal message\" alert technology allows the army to notify all cell phones in a specific area without the need for any action on citizens' part. The warning notification will be immediately displayed on mobile phone screens, accompanied by a loud ringtone.\n\nHome Front Command has also moved search and rescue forces to Tel Aviv and other cities in preparation for potential Iranian and Hezbollah attacks, the IDF said on Tuesday.\n\nThe Ram Battalion (668) of the IDF's Search and Rescue Brigade (60th) has repositioned itself in Tel Aviv, the economic and cultural hub of Israel along the central Mediterranean coastline.\n\nThe Ram Battalion would respond to any building collapses or other destruction.\n\nAccording to the IDF, rapid rescue teams have also been deployed to Haifa, the Haifa bay area and several cities in the south and center of the country.\n\nSome Israeli municipalities are preparing to turn underground parking lots into emergency shelters in the event of a sustained wave of attacks from Iran and its terror proxies.\n\nDavid Aharoni, director of the security and emergency department at the Tel Aviv Municipality, told Channel 12 that residents are encouraged to first use the private shelters in the buildings, and then if they are outside, public shelters maintained by the municipality or in shelters in schools and community centers.", "source": {"uri": "tjvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

However, Hezbollah \"is still a wild card,\" according to U.S. officials cited by The Washington Post.\n\nIntensive American diplomacy and an increased military posture in the Middle East may have prompted Tehran to reconsider a major retaliatory strike against Israel, according to The Washington Post.\n\nWhite House officials told the newspaper's David Ignatius on Tuesday that they believe that President Joe Biden's efforts to stave off a wider war are paying off, at least with regard to Tehran. However, Iran's Lebanese terror proxy Hezbollah \"is still a wild card,\" the officials said.\n\nIran blames Israel for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week, and has threatened harsh retaliation. Haniyeh's assassination came just hours after Israel eliminated senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut, and Hezbollah, too, has threatened a significant retaliation.\n\nThe Biden administration has been making an urgent diplomatic push to de-escalate the situation, led by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\n\"No one should escalate this conflict,\" Blinken told reporters Tuesday, as quoted by the Post. \"We've been engaged in intense diplomacy with allies and partners, communicating that message directly to Iran. We communicated that message directly to Israel.\"\n\nThe Pentagon has also sent warships and fighter jets to the region as a show of force.\n\n\"Iran understands clearly that the United States is unwavering in its defense of our interests, our partners and our people. We have moved a significant amount of military assets to the region to underscore that principle,\" a senior administration official told Ignatius.\n\nWashington 'outraged' by Haniyeh hit\n\nWhite House officials responded with \"surprise and outrage\" to the elimination of Haniyeh because they viewed it as a setback in reaching a ceasefire in Gaza, according to Tuesday's report in the Post.\n\nWhile Jerusalem has not publicly commented on the targeted killing, it informed Washington immediately afterward that it was responsible, according to the article, which cited three U.S. officials.\n\nThe United States has been working with Israel and other parties on an agreement to halt fighting in Gaza, which is entering its tenth month, and free the remaining hostages held by Hamas.\n\nAccording to the Post, \"Israel has repeatedly launched strikes on Hezbollah and Iranian commanders without first informing the United States, enraging Biden officials and the president himself.\"\n\nReport: Iran could attack after gathering of Islamic countries\n\nWhile the U.S. officials cited by the Post believe diplomatic efforts are bearing fruit, Saudi Arabia's state-owned Al Arabiya, citing U.S. intelligence sources, reported on Tuesday that Iran might be delaying a strike until after Wednesday's gathering of Islamic countries' foreign ministers in Jeddah.\n\nThe meeting was called by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation at the behest of Tehran, according to the Islamic Republic's semi-official Tasnim News Agency. Its purpose is \"to discuss the continued crimes of the Israeli occupation against the Palestinian people.\"\n\nThe OIC represents 57 states and presents itself as \"the voice of the Muslim world.\"\n\nAccording to the Al Arabiya report, the Americans also estimate that they will be able to help Israel \"defend itself well\" against an Iranian attack, but are expressing concern that a massive attack by Hezbollah from Lebanon could overwhelm Israel's air defense systems.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the United States had over the weekend observed movements in Iran possibly signaling preparations for an attack. According to the U.S. officials cited in the report, these included the movement of missile launchers and various \"military exercises.\"\n\nWhite House: Ceasefire talks have 'reached a final stage'\n\nAccording to a White House readout released on Tuesday, Biden thanked Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi during a telephone conversation \"for his determined leadership in the facilitation of negotiations [toward an Israel-Hamas ceasefire] that have now reached a final stage.\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre refused to elaborate on Biden's remarks during a press briefing later in the day.\n\n\"I'm not going to go beyond what the president stated. We have been very clear that it is important that the -- the ceasefire deal, the hostage deal gets done. It has been a priority for this president for some time now,\" she said.\n\n\"You've heard from the president directly. He wants to get this done. He wants the war to end. He wants hostages to come home and to go home to their loved ones and families,\" she added. \"And so, we believe ... the end of this war would significantly lower tensions in the region.

Iran says it is preparing for a large-scale attack on the Jewish state as retribution.\n\n\"If the United States gets involved in any attack on Iran, have no doubt that the United States will be wiped out in Iraq, and the U.S. bases in the Persian Gulf region will be destroyed and those regimes that host the U.S. bases will be destroyed,\" Mohammad Marandi, an adviser to the Iranian nuclear negotiating team, said in a Wednesday interview.\n\nIran's regional terror proxies in Yemen and Iraq have launched hundreds of strikes on U.S. positions across the region in recent years, with a significant uptick coming in the wake of Hamas's Oct. 7 terror attack on Israel.\n\nFollowing Haniyeh's killing last week, Biden-Harris administration officials launched an intense diplomatic campaign to temper Tehran's response. Then, on Monday, a rocket attack from what the Pentagon called an \"Iran-aligned militia\" injured five U.S. service members and two U.S. contractors.\n\nStill, U.S. officials reportedly believe their mediation is working. Iranian officials are signaling they will bombard Israel with advanced missiles and rockets.\n\n\"Iran has no option but to strike Israel even though Iran does not want a regional war,\" Marandi said. \"So the smart thing for the Americans to do is to be very careful about what they do.\"\n\nIn likely preparation for a strike, the Iranian military has begun deploying \"radar, missile, and drone capabilities\" across the country, state-controlled media reported on Wednesday.\n\nRussia has also provided Tehran with advanced air defense systems and sophisticated radars following a request by Iran for support. Russian security official Sergei Shoigu was in Tehran earlier this week as Moscow began delivering weapons to the country.\n\nIran's army chief said in a Wednesday speech that Tehran's \"response to the Israeli act of assassination would be powerful,\" state-controlled media reported. \"The Zionist criminal gang that does not adhere to any rules and laws will definitely receive a definite and strong answer for the assassination of Martyr Haniyeh.\"\n\nIt is believed Iran has advanced ballistic missiles and drones that are capable of penetrating Israel's Iron Dome defense system, which was strained earlier in the year when Iran launched an unprecedented barrage on the Jewish state that was fended off with support from the United States and Arab nations.\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration, meanwhile, continues to urge calm on all sides.\n\n\"It's urgent that everyone in the region take stock of the situation, understand the risk of miscalculation, and make decisions that will calm tensions, not exacerbate them,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday. \"We've been engaged in intense diplomacy with allies and partners, communicating that message directly to Iran. We've communicated that message directly to Israel.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden reportedly scolded Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a tense phone call last week, with Biden telling Netanyahu, \"stop bullshitting me.\"\n\nThe United States believes Israel's recent killing of top Hezbollah and Hamas commanders is harming efforts to broker a ceasefire that would end the current war.\n\nResponding to the report, Netanyahu's office said the leader \"expects the Americans to also not intervene in Israeli politics.\"", "source": {"uri": "freebeacon.com", "dataType": "news",

by F-22 Raptor jets earlier, another move to demonstrate military strength in the region as Iran mulls its response to the alleged Israeli assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh last Wednesday.\n\nThe US aided Israel in defending itself against a massive drone and missile attack launched by Iran in April, in turn prompted by Israel's targeted killing of Mohammad Reza Zahedi, the highest-ranking Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander since the US eliminated Qasem Soleimani in 2020.\n\nSince Iran's threats, more naval vessels have arrived in the region to prevent projectiles from reaching Israel in the case of an assault by Iran or its proxies.\n\nThe nature and timing of the attack remains unknown, although officials have indicated it is expected to be similar to the April attack.\n\nIsrael has remained on edge as reports of the attack to come soon have been arriving for the past week.", "source": {"uri": "i24news.tv", "dataType": "news", "title":

They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, and did not provide further details about the potential attacks.\n\nThe latest crisis follows the assassinations last week of Fuad Shukr, a top Hezbollah military commander, and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas's political leader.

For more than a week, the United States and Israel have said that the attack may come anytime. There are fears that the anticipated Iranian attack and subsequent Israeli response could plunge the Middle East in an all-out war.\n\nNow, The Guardian has reported that owing to lack of support for the attack from fellow Islamic nations, Iran may rethink the scope of its attack.\n\nThe newspaper, however, said that Iran is not going to cancel the plan to attack but may scale it down. It may now attack those responsible for the attack, specifically the Mossad and other Iranian agencies, instead of civilians.\n\nLack of Muslim countries' support may affect Iran's plan: Report\n\nAt a meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Saudi Arabia this week, the member-states condemned the Haniyeh's assassination in Tehran in unison, but they did not explicitly support the widely-anticipated attack on Israel.\n\nAt the meeting, Pakistan's Deputy Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said that the assassination must be avenged but they must not fall into Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's trap of \"design for a wider war\".\n\nMoreover, Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi has met Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri twice since Haniyeh's assassination. He has told Iran that Jordan will not allow its airspace to be used by Iran and would shoot down missiles, drones, or rockets if the pass through Jordanian airspace.\n\nSafadi told CNN that Jordan has conveyed to both Israel and Iran that no one should use the Jordanian airspace. He said the first commitment of the country is to its own people and it would not allow Iran or Israel to make Jordan a party of their conflict.\n\n\"Our message has been clear to the Iranians, to the Israelis, that we will not be a battleground for anybody. We will not allow anybody, to the extent that we can, to violate our airspace. Our first responsibility is towards our people, protecting the sovereignty of our country and the safety of our people. So our position is that nobody should use our airspace, nobody should subject our people to the threat of any projectile falling over any of our territory and harming our people, and that is a position that we've communicated to both the Iranians and the Israelis in very unequivocal terms,\" said Safadi.\n\nThe Guardian has reported that as so many days have passed since Haniyeh's assassination, officials are increasingly saying that Iran has no intention of starting a regional war or causing mass civilian casualties inside Israel.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has, however, reported that Iran has told Arab leaders that it no longer cares if its attack triggers an all-out war in the Middle East.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

This discourse has been led by the new Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ali Khamenei. Notably, Iran hoisted a red flag known as the \"Flag of Revenge\" atop a mosque on the outskirts of Qom city, as reported by the BBC. Raising the \"Flag of Revenge\" in Iranian tradition signifies a formal declaration of a state of war. Furthermore, Iranian Leader Ali Khamenei has issued a warning of \"severe punishment\" for Israel in light of Haniyeh's assassination.\n\nThis makes us anticipate an increase in tensions in the Middle East, particularly given Iran's swift responses to the United States during the Trump administration following Soleimani's death, as well as its direct attacks on Israel. What makes this situation even more dangerous is the potential for other parties to become directly embroiled in the conflict. The killing of Ismail Haniyeh by Netanyahu on Iranian soil is a direct provocation to Iran, Hamas, and Hezbollah, especially in the wake of the assassination of prominent Hezbollah leader Fuad Shukr.\n\nThe assassination of Ismail Haniyeh marks Prime Minister Netanyahu's second endeavour to escalate the longstanding conflict between Israel and Iran into a confrontation, which had previously been conducted through proxies for many years. The initial instance occurred in early April when Israel targeted a structure near the Iranian consulate in Damascus, resulting in the deaths of seven members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, including the notable commander Mohammad Reza Zahedi. In retaliation, Iran executed a missile and drone assault on Israel. This incident represented Netanyahu's first provocation aimed at intensifying the conflict in the Middle East, an action that The Economist characterized as a significant escalation, highlighting that it was the inaugural occasion on which Iran attacked Israel directly from its territory. Additionally, an article from The Hill, a publication focused on congressional and White House matters, featured insights from Tara Sonnenshein, a researcher at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, who indicated that Iran may have crossed a \"red line\" by deploying drones against Israel.\n\nNetanyahu's intentions to escalate the conflict in the Middle East are evident, as he stands to benefit significantly from such actions. By creating the illusion of victory following his failure to achieve tangible success in the Gaza conflict, he aims to bolster his political standing. Moreover, the prospect of a broader regional war serves as a convenient distraction from the atrocities and genocide being committed against innocent civilians in Gaza. Moreover, this potential escalation could potentially prolong Netanyahu's time in office and potentially shield him from impending legal consequences related to corruption charges.\n\nHowever, Netanyahu's primary objective is to involve the United States in a large-scale conflict in the Middle East. He has consistently sought to instigate a direct clash between the United States and Iran, viewing it as a significant benefit for Israel. Netanyahu has been obsessively focused on this goal for an extended period. Research indicates that since the 1990s, Netanyahu has been warning about Iran's potential development of nuclear weapons, frequently urging the United States to authorize or carry out military strikes against Tehran. This campaign has been accompanied by covert Israeli operations aimed at disrupting Iran's nuclear program, including the targeted killings of key Iranian scientists and nuclear facilities. In his memoir, \"Bibi: My Story,\" Netanyahu recounts how he requested President Barack Obama in 2013 to launch strikes on Iranian nuclear sites during Obama's initial visit to Israel, a plea that was turned down. In 2015, Netanyahu spoke before a joint session of Congress, urging lawmakers to oppose the nuclear agreement with Iran known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, asserting that Iran not only poses a serious threat to Israel but also to global peace.\n\nToday, Netanyahu finds it increasingly imperative to involve the United States in the Middle East for a variety of reasons. Firstly, to shield Israel from potential Iranian aggression, particularly in the aftermath of the exhaustive ten-month conflict in Gaza following the Hamas-led Operation Protective Edge on October 7, as well as attacks on Israeli settlements and other fronts, as reported by the New York Times. Secondly, to ensure that any future American agreement with Iran will not materialize in the event of a Democratic Party victory. Thirdly, the United States' backing of Netanyahu in this aggressive approach may serve to alleviate international criticism, particularly following the International Court of Justice's ruling that the occupation was illegal and the International Criminal Court prosecutor's announcement of seeking arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Lastly, and most significantly, this escalation towards a regional conflict involving the United States will allow Netanyahu to alter the Middle East dynamics and present this contrived war as a necessary battle for Israel's survival in the hostile Middle East.\n\nSo far, it appears that the United States is aligning closely with Netanyahu's ambitions, particularly during the crucial period of the US elections, where Jewish funding and backing hold significant sway. Despite Biden's previous declaration that the US would not back any Israeli retaliation against Iran, emphasizing the divergence between Netanyahu's policies and those of the US, recent developments show an increase in American military presence in the Middle East. The US Department of Defense, through a statement from the Pentagon, announced the reinforcement of US forces in the region in anticipation of a potential Iranian strike on Israel, including the deployment of additional warships and fighter jets.\n\nCertainly, the outbreak of a major war in the Middle East would harm American interests. For the United States, such a war would significantly expand its commitments and entanglements in the region at a time when the U.S. is seeking to withdraw its forces from the Middle East. More importantly, the U.S. blindly following Netanyahu's criminal escapades would undermine its prestige and influence in the Middle East, while bolstering the influence of other regional and international actors. However, Netanyahu continues to receive support, despite the hollow opposition statements issued by the Biden administration that are not implemented on the ground. The question is how far the United States will support Netanyahu's criminal actions.", "source": {"uri": "dailynewsegypt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News Egypt"}, "authors": [],

But the near-daily exchanges of fire have added up.\n\nSatellite imagery makes clear just how profound the toll has been on both sides of the border. This is what one Lebanese town, Aita al-Shaab, looked like before and after it came under attack.\n\nIsraeli forces and Hezbollah militants, who are backed by Iran, have been fighting off and on for years. But the conflict intensified last October after another Iranian ally, Hamas, led an attack on Israel from the Gaza Strip, setting off the war there.\n\nIn the cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, the most widespread structural destruction has been in Lebanon, where thousands of buildings have been damaged or destroyed. The thousands of Israeli attacks since October have far outnumbered Hezbollah attacks into Israel, according to data collected by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, a nonprofit that studies world conflicts.\n\nAround a quarter of the structures are damaged in some villages, according to an analysis of satellite data by Corey Scher of the CUNY graduate center.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes and shelling in Lebanon have killed nearly 500 people, at least 100 of them civilians, according to the U.N. and Lebanon's health ministry.\n\nHezbollah has launched 7,500 rockets, missiles and drones since the start of the war in Gaza, according to the Israeli prime minister's office, killing 43 people in Israel, more than half of them civilians, and setting swaths of farmland ablaze. Northern Israel has seen more than 700 wildfires, according to the prime minister's office, which Israel has blamed on the Hezbollah barrages.\n\nThis satellite imagery shows what happened to large areas of dry brush surrounding the Malkiya kibbutz after it was ignited.\n\nIt is not only Israel that is burning.\n\nThe fighting has caused significant fires on both sides of the border, and many fear they may cause long-lasting damage to land that plays an important role in food production.\n\nMany villages near the border on both sides are ghost towns. Roughly 60,000 people in northern Israel and 100,000 in southern Lebanon have been displaced by the fighting along the border since October, with no clear timeline for returning home.\n\nNow, there is fear that like the wildfires, the conflict itself may spread. In the past three weeks, attacks have escalated, threatening a larger regional war.\n\nIn July, a rocket from Lebanon killed 12 civilians in a town in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights. It was the deadliest attack on Israeli-controlled territory since the Oct. 7 attacks led by Hamas.\n\nIsrael responded with a strike in Beirut's southern suburbs, killing a Hezbollah leader along with five civilians, according to Lebanese authorities. A senior Hamas figure was assassinated hours later in the capital of Iran. Both Hezbollah and Iran vowed vengeance.\n\nLebanon's border towns with Israel, made up mainly of Shiite Muslims, are a bastion of support for Hezbollah. But there are also Christian and Sunni Muslim enclaves.\n\nSome of those border towns that have borne much of the destruction in the current attacks were the scene of heavy ground fighting in 2006, when Israel and Lebanon fought their last war.\n\nNow, with hostilities heating up, some Israelis want their country to mount a full-scale invasion again. Others fear that an all-out response from Hezbollah could be devastating. The militants' arsenal of sophisticated precision-guided missiles is considered capable of striking cities across Israel, along with critical infrastructure like power plants and ports.\n\nIsraeli military commanders have their own concerns. They are still prosecuting one major war -- against Hamas in Gaza -- and do not relish the prospect of a second. And with munitions stockpiles dwindling, it is unclear how intense a battle the military could wage in Lebanon.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"},

A rocket strike at a soccer field in the village has killed at least 12 children and teens. It's the deadliest strike on an Israeli target along the country's northern border since the fighting between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah began.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah stand at the brink of full-scale war for the first time since 2006. But more dire than Hezbollah's rocket arsenal is the threat that it will launch an Oct. 7-style ground incursion into Israel.\n\nThe immediate crisis is a result of what Israel officials say was a Hezbollah rocket attack that killed 12 Israeli Druze youths. Since the day after Hamas' Oct. 7 massacre, Hezbollah has been firing rockets into Israel almost daily. While the majority of the strikes have used anti-tank guided missiles, the group has also used longer-range, more powerful munitions provided by Iran. That was apparently the case on July 27, when Hezbollah is accused of firing an Iranian Falaq-1 rocket toward the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights and striking a soccer field and playground in the Druze community of Majdal Shams. (Though Israel released data on the rocket and its trajectory that tie it to Hezbollah, the group has issued a rare denial of responsibility for the attack.)\n\nThree days later, an Israeli airstrike killed Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut. And the day after that, an explosion widely attributed to Israel killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh at a guesthouse in Tehran. The region is now on pins and needles awaiting reprisals.\n\nAnd yet there is hope for de-escalation. The factors that have prevented Hezbollah from opening a full-fledged second front for Israel since October still hold true.\n\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has pledged to continue firing rockets into Israel until the fighting stops in Gaza. And even if a cease-fire deal is reached and the rockets stop, more than 60,000 Israeli civilians displaced from their homes along the border with Lebanon will not return until the threat posed by Hezbollah ground forces is dealt with.\n\nThe Hamas massacre came straight out of Hezbollah's playbook. The Israeli military has been actively training for years to counter a Hezbollah plot to overrun Israeli communities, kill and kidnap civilians, and undermine Israel's sense of security. Part of what was unexpected about Oct. 7 was that it happened on the southern rather than the northern border.\n\nMoreover, after its 2006 war with Israel, Hezbollah built an arsenal of some 150,000 rockets, deployed forces throughout southern Lebanon and otherwise violated a U.N. Security Council resolution meant to prevent further conflict.\n\nIsraelisare beginning to learn just how close to disaster they also came on Oct. 7. As Hamas terrorists streamed across the southern border that day, only two Israeli battalions comprising about 600 personnel were covering the entire northern border. Today some 40 battalions defend that border, but such a deployment is difficult to maintain over the long haul.\n\nIsraeli officials are under tremendous pressure to return their citizens to the sovereign territory Hezbollah has effectively depopulated for most of a year.\n\nIsraeli officials understand that a war with Hezbollah today would be like no war Israel has ever fought. They would prefer to let the current war end and take a couple of years to restock munitions and plan for a war with Hezbollah. But if Israeli civilians are unable to return to their homes soon, the war may come much sooner than they would like.\n\nIsraelis agree that they can no longer live with a gun to their heads, not from the south or from the north. The idea that enemies sworn to destroy them can be allowed to amass massive arsenals on their borders is no longer tenable. That means Israel will ultimately have to address both Hezbollah's rocket stockpile and its 30,000-strong standing militia.", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The fact that we even have to ask the question can be blamed on what has led to so much of the current instability in the Middle East: the Biden-Harris administration's appeasement strategy in the region.\n\nEven before the Iranian-sponsored Hamas terrorist attack on Israel last October, their failed approach was emboldening America's adversaries, notably Iran and its proxies. And the administration has only doubled down on its flawed strategy since then, letting money continue flowing to Tehran and promising the Palestinians a state as a reward for their terrorism.\n\nUnder the Biden-Harris administration, the United States\u202fhas freed close to $100 billion in Iranian assets and restarted negotiations on the dangerous Iran nuclear deal. The administration even abstained from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) vote to declare an immediate ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war -- a war instigated by Iran.\n\nThis feckless approach has already had terrible outcomes. The world saw that last October, when Hamas terrorists, funded and equipped by an emboldened Iran, infiltrated Israel and massacred 1,200 Israelis. Then, on April 13, Iran launched 300-plus missiles and drones towards Israel -- the largest attack in Iran's history in the region, and the first direct attack by Iran on Israel.\n\n>>> Biden's Anti-Israel Deterrence Will Provoke Future Violence\n\nSince last October, Iran-backed militias have attacked more than 170 U.S. bases and assets, and Hezbollah has launched more than 2,000 attacks on northern Israel. The Jewish state is now in more danger than it has been for half a century.\n\nWhat we have seen over the last year is a catastrophic failure of deterrence in the Middle East. It doesn't have to be this way. Deterrence creates stability and peace. Just look at the Trump administration's record.\n\nUnder President Trump, we didn't have a single war or embassy evacuated. Israel was strong and secure, and signed the first peace deals with Arab neighbors in 25 years. Energy markets were stabilized, and energy prices for Americans were much more affordable.\n\nThese positive outcomes result from standing strongly with Israel in word and deed, enforcing tough economic sanctions on Iran, and not shying away from eliminating terrorist leaders like Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Qasem Soleimani.\n\nWe also can't forget how President Trump's leadership as a commander-in-chief served as a deterrent to Iran. His public condemnation and aggressiveness towards the country made it clear to them and the rest of the world that the United States will no longer tolerate their actions. His sanctions regime kept Iran's nuclear program in a box.\n\nToday, Iran perceives the United States as weak largely due to President Biden's cognitive decline and foreign policy gaffes -- including the embarrassing the Afghanistan withdrawal and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Vice President Harris has been complicit in his failed policies while she conspired to hide his weakness from the American people.\n\nThe first step to restoring a deterrence is to convey that the U.S. will hold Iran directly responsible for any attack conducted by its surrogates and proxies on U.S. forces, facilities, citizens, and interests.\n\n>>> Endangering Israel's Security -- and Our Own\n\nNext would be imposing costs on Iran by removing Iranian military commanders responsible for directing their surrogates and proxies, as well as seizing and forfeiting all vessels and cargo sanctioned Iranian exports. This also means enforcing all sanctions on Iran's oil, petrochemical, and metal exports, the financial institutions that process the sales, and the entities involved in the transport, insurance, and services.\n\nThe United States must also stand with our ally Israel. Restoring and accelerating the provision of all munitions authorized by Congress for Israel and our Middle East partners providing support to the US and Israel should become a top priority for Congress if the Biden-Harris administration continues to slow-walk the supplies.\n\nThe Iran-backed terrorist threat\u202fhere at home also must be better addressed. Identifying, tracking, detaining, and expelling all illegal immigrants who have entered the U.S. from Iran, or its affiliates is necessary. The president may also use 212(f) of the INA to suspend the entry of Iranians and their partners into the U.S. should they be found to harm national interests.\n\nSimply put, there are many tools to better deter Iran and its proxies available to a president who actually takes America's national security seriously. Deterrence creates peace and stability in the region. The absence of it invites war.", "source": {"uri": "heritage.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Heritage Foundation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

After Haniye was murdered by Israel in the heart of Tehran, there was more pressure on Iran than ever before. The whole world, and especially Muslim countries, are waiting for Iran's response. Iran has acted cautiously on this issue so far. Foreign Policy Expert Dr. Iran's possible retaliation against Israel. Bar\u0131\u015f Ad\u0131belli commented.\n\n\"IRAN DID NOT GET THE SUPPORT IT EXPECTED FROM RUSSIA\"\n\nDr. stated that Iran could not get the response it expected from Russia after Haniye's assassination.

Following the incident, Iran promised to inflict \"harsh punishment\" on Israel, which has neither denied nor acknowledged any role in the killing. Washington expected a large-scale missile and drone strike on the Jewish state at the beginning of this week, but the attack has not so far materialized.\n\nThe outlet claimed in an article on Wednesday that the reason for this was the diplomatic efforts by the administration of US President Joe Biden, which has been engaged in intense diplomacy in recent days to ensure that American allies in the Middle East lobby Tehran to reconsider its plan to strike Israel.\n\nAccording to two high-ranking US officials, who talked to Politico, Washington warned Tehran through intermediaries that \"a massive strike would only inflame tensions and risk a direct confrontation between the two countries.\"\n\nThe Iranian authorities initially rejected the US argument that Haniyeh's killing did not require a large-scale response because it was caused by a bomb planted in a covert operation, and was not part of a larger attack on Iran, the sources said. But now Tehran is \"increasingly on board\" with such an interpretation of events, they claimed.\n\nAnother argument used by Washington was the fact that no Iranian citizens were killed in the attack on the Hamas political chief, the officials added.\n\n\"Tehran seems to have re-calibrated and the US does not expect an attack on Israel imminently,\" the sources said. However, they added that \"some kind of Iranian response\" to Haniyeh's assassination should still be expected.\n\nThe Washington Post reported on Tuesday that Israel only informed the US of the Hamas political chief's assassination after the fact, which caused \"surprise and outrage\" in the White House.\n\nSpeaking at the extraordinary meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, Iran's acting foreign minister, Ali Bagheri Kani, called Haniyeh's killing \"only one example of the terrorist crimes of the Israeli regime in the region and beyond.\"\n\nWith the US preventing the UN Security Council from taking \"appropriate action... against the aggressions of the Israeli regime, Iran has no choice but to use its inherent right to legitimate defense,\" the diplomat insisted.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Qasem_Soleimani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of Qasem Soleimani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Organisation of Islamic Cooperation"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeddah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeddah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jeddah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.08/article/66b4c03885f54049120cd4c6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799808", "eventUri": "eng-9799808", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

The only questions are when, where and how far will Iran go, which leads to its own supplemental question: how dangerous will this situation now become?\n\nIran's intention to retaliate was announced on July 7 by acting foreign minister, Ali Bagheri-Kani, at an extraordinary session of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Saudi Arabia. Bagheri-Kani told the meeting: \"In the absence of appropriate action by the [United Nations] security council against the aggressions and violations of the Israeli regime, the Islamic Republic of Iran has no choice but to exercise its inherent right to legitimate defense against this regime's actions.\"\n\nIsrael is convening an emergency meeting of its security cabinet to discuss how to prepare for this retaliation. According to Middle East analysts at the Institute for the Study of War, this is being made more difficult for Israel's security agencies by Iran's armed forces media which is publishing a range of different information. The aim, they believe, is to \"decrease Israel's ability to effectively defend against an Iranian attack by causing Israel to disperse its air and missile-defense assets\".\n\nGaza Update is available as a fortnightly email newsletter.

Where Haniyeh was the pragmatic face of Hamas, his successor, Yahya Sinwar, is widely understood to be the architect of the October 7 attacks and is viewed as one of the group's most extreme figures. He has, after all, spent 23 years of his life in Israeli prisons and has been directing the operations of militants inside the Gaza Strip since the start of the war.\n\nAccording to Leonie Fleischmann of City, University of London, Sinwar's appointment sends a clear message to Israel that killing the group's leaders will not weaken Hamas but will instead strengthen its resolve to hold on to Gaza and continue engaging in a violent struggle.\n\nWith Sinwar taking the reins, a ceasefire in Gaza looks to have become even more remote - he reportedly has closer ties to Iran and is more aggressive than other Hamas leaders. But, in Fleischmann's view, the fact that ceasefire hopes have been dimmed are not entirely surprising when you take the position of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, into account.\n\nNetanyahu has been regularly criticised, from both inside Israel and more widely, for prolonging the assault on Gaza in order to ensure his own political survival. His apparent sanctioning of Haniyeh's assassination - Israel has not claimed responsibility for the killing - may have been yet another attempt to derail the ceasefire negotiations, Fleischmann says.\n\nRead more: Ceasefire in Gaza more remote with the assassination of Haniyeh and promotion of Sinwar\n\nThis is a view shared by Scott Lucas, an expert on international politics at University College Dublin. He argues that the war has landed Netanyahu in deep trouble. Netanyahu has so far failed on his pledge to \"destroy\" Hamas, and Israeli troops appears to be stuck in perpetual operations in full view of a mainly disapproving world.\n\nThe high-profile killing of \"enemies\" in Haniyeh and Shukr may have bought Netanyahu some time, he says. But it's a gamble for the Israeli prime minister. The political dynamic in Washington - once Israel's most staunch friend - shifted when the US president, Joe Biden, a longtime and stalwart supporter, announced he would not contest the next election.\n\nA lot will depend on who wins in November. As we have reported here, Biden's replacement at the top of the Democratic Party's ticket, Kamala Harris, has a far more nuanced attitude to the conflict in Gaza and has already publicly declared that she wants a ceasefire sooner rather than later, with a two-state solution firmly on the table.\n\nRead more: Assassination of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders is a gamble for Benjamin Netanyahu that buys him time but risks wider wars\n\nOver the past ten months, as the conflict in Gaza has raged, Israel (and the US) and Iran (and its proxies in Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon and Syria) have also engaged in a sporadic, tit-for-tat series of strike and counter-strike. Most of this has been carefully calibrated to keep the hostilities alive, while avoiding escalation into all-out war, something neither side has wanted.\n\nBut the rocket which hit a football game in a village in the Golan Heights on July 27 changed all that. The strike killed 12 children and teenagers, all between the ages of ten and 20, injuring at least 29 others. Erika Jiminez, Leverhulme early career fellow at the School of Law, at Queen's University Belfast, who has been conducting research in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, warns that it has greatly increased the complexity of the situation.\n\nIsrael captured the Golan Heights from Syria after the six-day war in 1967 and has occupied the strategically important region ever since, declaring the rocky 1,000 square kilometre plateau to be part of Israel in 1981. The vast majority of the Syrian population fled in 1967, but about 20,000 inhabitants remained - mainly Syrian Druze people. The Druze are a minority Arab sect with about a million members spread across the Middle East, who don't believe in inter-marriage and don't allow outsiders to join the religion.\n\nAs Jiminez explains, despite being given Israeli identity papers, they have steadfastly refused to take up Israeli nationality. But notwithstanding, Netanyahu lost no time in blaming Hezbollah for the attack and vowed they would pay a \"hefty price\".\n\nRead more: Rocket attack kills 12 children in Golan Heights - who are the Druze who live there?\n\nWhether we will now see a wider regional conflict is difficult to say: all parties are making ominous noises. But, according to Ian Parmeter of Australian National University, the death of particularly Haniyeh is likely to have caused enormous anger in Iran and it has pushed the whole region onto a knife's edge.\n\nIn his view, Iranian retaliation is most likely to come through Hezbollah. But Parmeter says that Iran also has other allies on which it can call, including Shia militant groups in Syria and Iraq, as well as the Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nWe've seen that Iran has declared its intention to seek revenge for the assassinations. The question now remains when it will come and what will be the consequences.\n\nRead more: Hamas leader's killing in Tehran likely to further escalate violence in Middle East\n\nGaza Update is available as a fortnightly email newsletter.

In this article, India Today's Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) team tries to provide a big picture of the power structure in the region.\n\nIMMINENT ATTACK\n\nIsrael and its largest ally, the United States are gearing up for a large-scale attack following a string of high-profile killings of Axis leaders, with the most prominent being Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah commander Faud Shukr less than 10 days ago.\n\nTensions in the region have been high since the deadly October 7 Hamas attack on Israel last year but spiralled up dangerously after Israel allegedly carried out ambitious operations in Tehran and Beirut following a rocket strike that killed 12 young men in Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on July 27.\n\nIn April, Iran fired more than 330 drones and missiles toward Iran in response to an Israeli attack on its consulate in the Syrian capital Damascus that killed 13 people. Iranian state media has suggested that the upcoming attack would be similar to but greater than the April assault.\n\nPOSSIBLE ATTACK SCENARIO\n\nAs D-day nears, analysts suggest three approaches Iran may adopt to deal a blow that deters the Israelis but not as severe as to invite direct US involvement.\n\nScenario 1: More missiles & drones from different sides - The foremost challenge facing the Iranians is the difficulty of bypassing Israel's robust missile defence systems. Out of over 300 projectiles sent in April, only a few fell in the Israeli territory. The rest were intercepted and eliminated before they reached its airspace.\n\nAnalysts at the Institute of the Study of War, a US-based think tank believe that Iran would not just fire projectiles from its territory but ask regional proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and Iraq to launch simultaneous attacks to overwhelm the air defences of Israel and the US. Drones and missiles fired from Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria would be much harder to intercept than those launched from Iran due to shorter distances and flight times to Israel. It would give US and Israeli forces significantly less time to respond.\n\nAs per assessments, it would take Hezbollah drones around 15 minutes to reach Haifa and around 40 minutes flying on direct paths to reach Tel Aviv.\n\nScenario 2: Simultaneous attacks on US forces - Experts fear that Iran Axis forces in Syria and Iraq could simultaneously attack US forces, especially in northern Syria. Recent reports in Syrian media talked of the arrival of Yemen's Houthis in Syria from Iraq and their commission to different positions across eastern and southern Syria.\n\nSuch a strategy will pull American attention and resources away from identifying and intercepting projectiles bound for Israel, making projectiles more likely to penetrate Israeli air defences.\n\nScenario 3: Multi-day attack - Iran and its allies could conduct waves of drone and missile attacks over several days, enabling Iran and its proxies to learn and adjust their attacks as they observe how successful each volley is.\n\nThere are also talks of targeted killings of Israeli figures in Iranian media. On August 4, Iranian armed forces-run Defa Press called on the Axis of Resistance to target \"prominent\" Israeli leaders in retaliation for Haniyeh's killing - which has been blamed on Israel.\n\nNonetheless, it would be difficult for Iran and its proxies to hand over any real damage to Israel, given the massive American firepower and troops presence in the Middle East region.\n\nAs per The Intercept, the US has more than 60 bases, garrisons, or shared foreign facilities in the region - from small combat outposts to massive air bases in countries like Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn June last year, the US Department of Defence put its troop numbers in the Middle East at more than 30,000. It is believed to have increased since, given the presence of a carrier strike group and an amphibious ready group - together hosting more than 12,000 sailors and marines not to mention many other sophisticated warships sailing in the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman and the Mediterranian.\n\nEarlier this week, the US ordered the deployment of an additional fighter squadron to the Middle East to bolster defensive air support capability in addition to ballistic missile defence-capable cruisers and destroyers.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India

Earlier, it was speculated that a missile strike from Israel did the job. As of press time, that Jewish nation had neither claimed nor denied responsibility for the deadly strike that has left Iran reeling in confusion and embarrassment. The Hamas' strongman was in that Islamic country as a guest of the government to participate in the activities marking the inauguration of the newly-elected president, Masoud Pezeshkian.\n\nAlmost simultaneously, Saleh al-Arouri, one of the most senior figures in the Hamas hierarchy and a leading man on both the political and military fronts, was killed in Beirut, Lebanon.\n\nIran has vowed to inflict maximum damage on Israel in retaliation. Hamas and their allies in Hezbollah are also planning reprisal attacks. The delay in launching the attacks, they said, was part of the plan to wear Israel out to catch it off-guard.\n\nAlready, the United States of America has commenced the process of deploying military resources to the Middle East region to safeguard its assets there and also to offer Israel any help it might require in the event of attacks by Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah. The United States and Israel have committed to face any reactions from that axis of resistance. And the world is intensely frightened at the prospect of a full-blown war engulfing the region.\n\nThere are concerns that incidents in that region last week, if not controlled, might escalate the war in Gaza. To avoid this, the United States is mounting a frenzy of diplomatic moves to bring the situation to a manageable level. This was even as Iran was reported to have launched a strike on America's base in Iraq that caused what is described in military circles as tolerable damage. To most observers of events in the region, for Iran, risks of not retaliating to Israel assassinations in Tehran outweigh risks of retaliation.\n\nFor the first time, Iran has admitted publicly that it has nuclear capability. Add this to its burgeoning alliances with Russia and North Korea, and the anxiety in diplomatic circles becomes exceedingly palpable.\n\nThis newspaper hopes that diplomacy will be given free rein and that the United States and its allies in the region, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, for instance, will be able to persuade embarrassed Iran, hurt Hamas and Hezbollah to toe the path of restraint. How far that will go is yet to be seen, especially with the appointment of a hardliner, Gaza chief, Yahya Sinwar, as a replacement for Haniyeh, known in the diplomatic community as a relative moderate.\n\nBefore the events of last week, international pressure, including an International Court at the Hague's pronouncement, had failed to persuade Netanyahu to abandon his obdurate policy of destroying Hamas. The argument that Hamas is an ideology that cannot be easily annihilated has failed to sway Netanyahu, whose political survival is perceived to be intricately hinged on a prolonged war in Gaza.\n\nIn our opinion, the Israeli leader is welcome to fight for his political survival the way he sees fit, provided that he does not drag the rest of the world into it. Unfortunately, the United States, in our view, is the only nation that can influence him to abandon what is becoming a revenge mission. We use the word, unfortunately, advisedly because that world power, instead of using its leverage on Israel to achieve peace is, in the opinion of the international community, fanning the embers of heightened conflict. The pervasive position around the world is that there is an urgent need to de-escalate the war in Gaza. And time is fast running out.\n\nWith the war between Russia and Ukraine intensifying so aggressively, the China-Taiwan face-off in the South China Sea, and North Korea's deployment of missile launchers on its borders with South Korea, the world, we are afraid to point out, is sitting on a tinderbox. The election in the United States is fast approaching. The outcome, according to polls, is presently not easily predictable. There may be a change of government personnel and, with it, a policy change. No one knows for sure, especially with the sabre-rattling that one of the presidential candidates has become famous for.\n\nFrom this premise, we urge all parties involved in the crisis to do everything possible to avert the cataclysm an escalated conflict in the Middle East may turn out to be. If good sense fails to prevail and the worst becomes feasible, there will be no victors, and humanity, as we know it now, may not be the same. No one should desire that.", "source": {"uri": "leadership.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Leadership"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org",

Israel hasn't confirmed or denied responsibility.\n\nAccording to CNN, flights across Iran and its neighbours were cancelled amid fears that missiles could fly any moment, triggering a much-feared escalation of Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nWith his country on the brink of triggering a regional war, Iran's Acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri attended the OIC Summit on Wednesday.\n\nCNN quoted Jordan's foreign minister, Ayman Safadi as saying, \"The first step toward stopping the escalation is ending its root cause, which is the continued Israeli aggression on Gaza.\"\n\nUnited States Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the US has told both- Israel and Iran that \"no one should escalate this conflict\". He added that the ceasefire negotiations have reached \"a final stage\", CNN reported. Blinken added that any tensions in the region can jeopardize the peace talks.\n\nAccording to CNN, Safadi was in Tehran over the weekend and met both Bagheri and Iran's new President Masoud Pezeshkian, and appears to believe that Iran may be looking for an off ramp to escalation.\n\nIran needs diplomatic cover to back away from its threats and a Gaza ceasefire would allow Tehran to claim it cares more for the lives of Palestinians than it does for taking revenge. \"But the payoff needs to be big enough for Iran as its honour and deterrence are at stake,\" CNN said.\n\nAccording to CNN, France's President Emanuel Macron is adding his diplomatic heft, declaring in a phone call with Pezeshkian Wednesday that retaliation against Israel \"has to be abandoned\".\n\nPezeshkian's response suggests he is listening, CNN reported quoting Iran PM, \"If America and Western countries really want to prevent war and insecurity in the region, to prove this claim, they should immediately stop selling arms and supporting the Zionist regime and force this regime to stop the genocide and attacks on Gaza and accept a ceasefire.\"\n\nHowever, Hamas made peace talks with Israel further difficult as it replaced Haniyeh with Yahya Sinwar, the alleged mastermind behind the October 7 attacks, which resulted into the ongoing war.\n\nCNN said that the resolution from OIC will come into effect only if US President Joe Biden meddles, as it can convince Netanyahu.\n\nRiyad Mansour, Palestine's Permanent Observer at the UN said, \"The region does not need escalation. What the region needs is a ceasefire. What the region needs to address legitimate rights. I have a feeling that Prime Minister Netanyahu wants to drag President Biden into a war with Iran,\" he said.\n\nCNN reported that Israel views Iran and Lebanon-based Hezbollah as different hands under the same theological head.\n\nA US official told CNN that they fear Hezbollah may strike Israel, and if the latter retaliates, the whole region may get wrapped in a regional escalation.

I'm Andrew England, the Middle East editor at the Financial Times, standing in for Gideon Rachman while he's away. This week's edition is about the threat of all-out war in the Middle East. My guest is Emile Hokayem, director at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London and a Middle East expert. Last week, Israel carried out two assassinations against Hizbollah and Hamas leaders in Beirut and Tehran. A harsh response from Iran and its Lebanese allies seems almost inevitable, as Israel and the wider region wait anxiously for what may come next. The key question is, could this trigger the regional war that many have feared since Hamas's deadly October the 7th attack on Israel and Israel's thunderous retaliatory offensive in Gaza?\n\n[FUNERAL CEREMONY MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nAndrew England\n\nA funeral ceremony for Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was held in Tehran last Friday, and Iran has vowed that his death will not go unpunished. The assassination of Fuad Shukr, Hizbollah's military chief, in Beirut has prompted a similar threat from the Lebanese militant group. Meanwhile, the US has deployed more military assets, including warships and fighter jets, to the region to help defend Israel and display deterrence. And diplomatic efforts to broker a deal to secure the release of more than 100 Israeli hostages still held in Gaza have stalled.\n\nNews clip\n\nAnother blow against peace. Israeli police clash with protesters in Tel Aviv, where not even the threat that an Iranian attack could keep them off the streets. They accuse their prime minister of choosing escalation over a hostage deal.\n\nAndrew England\n\nSo I started my conversation with Emile by asking how close we are now to all-out war in the Middle East.\n\nEmile Hokayem\n\nI think at this moment, both sides are willing to risk a war, but don't necessarily want an all-out war. It's almost a game of dare. And clearly in that game, the Israelis are ahead. They've scored more points. They have more options. They have an idea of what they can do next, while it is Iran and its partners who have struggled to think about what they could do next while avoiding what would be an unwanted all-out war that would pull in the US. But we're as close as we've ever been, to be honest.\n\nAndrew England\n\nWhy do you think Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government went ahead with the assassinations? Because it wasn't just that they assassinated Shukr. It was in Hizbollah's heartlands in southern Beirut and obviously with Haniyeh, he was the political leader of Hamas. He was very much involved in the negotiations to try and secure a deal for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of Israeli hostages. So he was a key interlocutor with the mediators trying to end the war in Gaza, which is the reason for all these regional hostilities. So what would have been Israel's thinking in your game of dare to take such provocative acts?\n\nEmile Hokayem\n\nI think Netanyahu did it because he could do it, probably, well, here a few years from now, whether Israel had other opportunities to assassinate these two commanders. But the point is that Israel has been seeking to restore its credibility, its deterrence since October 7th. And what it's been able to do in two weeks in July is as close to that as it gets. The large-scale attack on Hodeida in Yemen, the assassination of Mohammed Deif, the military commander of Hamas, followed by the assassination of Fuad Shukr in Beirut and Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran -- all that, from Netanyahu's perspective, is a very strong political win that allows him to push back on his detractors in Israel, allows him to push back on the US and American pressure and tell everyone that military force dictates the battlefield and dictates negotiations. I suspect that strategists in Tehran and Beirut and elsewhere have been really struggling with the kind of response that would avoid that all-out war. I would argue that all along, Israel and Iran and Hizbollah wanted to avoid an all-out war, but Israel all along was willing to risk it because it thought it had escalation dominance. At the moment, I suspect that Hizbollah and Iran have joined that club of parties willing to risk a war in order to save face. And saving face is not a minor matter. It's essentially the credibility of deterrence.\n\nAndrew England\n\nWhat makes you so convinced that Iran and Hizbollah have wanted to avoid an all-out war? I mean, clearly Iran for many, many years has talked of wiping Israel off the map. The whole axis of resistance, which includes Hizbollah, the Houthis in Yemen, Hamas, Iraqi and Shia militias in Iraq and Syria, each have that shared anti-Israeli ideology. And, you know, we've seen Hizbollah exchange missile fire with Israel for 10 months since October the 8th. And the latest escalation started with a rocket attack in the occupied Golan Heights that killed 12 youngsters on a football pitch, which Israel and the US blamed on Hizbollah. So what makes you so convinced that Iran and Hizbollah don't want a war and what their calculation is?\n\nEmile Hokayem\n\nYeah, I mean, there is obviously very harsh Iranian rhetoric calling for the end of the existence of Israel and support for all these groups that are committed to not just the defeat, but the destruction of Israel. But I think the strategy is a bit different than that. Iran has wanted to harass and exhaust the US in the Middle East through a thousand small cuts. The point was never to go head-to-head with the US and Iran i think all along understood that going head-to-head with Israel meant going head-to-head with the US as well. So the strategy was to encircle Israel to build instruments of deterrence and punishment by creating this multi-front scenario where Israel could face attacks from the south, the north, the east, ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, UAVs and ground operations, and so on. And obviously, Hizbollah was the most formidable instrument in this regard.\n\nHizbollah wasn't designed to be a force that would face the kind of campaign we see right now. High-intensity, attritional campaign where Hizbollah, because of superior Israeli intelligence and air capabilities, faces the assassination of its top military cadre in such a short period. Now it has to learn under fire. And that's not what Iran had designed that particular force for. And, you know, to go back to October 7th, at the moment, there is zero evidence that Iran knew the details or the timing of the Hamas attack. Actually, there's evidence saying that even Hamas leaders, including Ismail Haniyeh, did not know about it. But twice since the 2000, Iran has faced a situation where it had to make high-stakes decision based on the behaviour of its partner. In 2006, Hizbollah was not necessarily wanting it, started a war with Israel that Iran had to manage at lands. And in 2023, Iran was surprised by what happened when Hamas went into Israel and killed large numbers and kidnapped large numbers of civilians and soldiers, and since then has tried to calibrate the response.\n\nI would add something else, which is quite remarkably, in a way, Ebrahim Raisi, the president, who died in a helicopter crash in May of this year, had in a way prioritised the improvement of regional relations. And while the region ie the Gulf states -- Egypt, Jordan, Turkey and so on -- are not naive about Iran. They went with that. They essentially wanted a more pacified regional environment. So when the war started, Iran managed to keep those relationships going. Iran actually has been more engaged by regional power since October 7th, precisely because people don't want to find themselves in the middle of a regional war. And so Iran saw that, in a way, as a validation that meant their partners could fight Israel, Hamas in a high-intensity war, the others in a medium-intensity manner and still keep its regional relations. So from Iran's perspective for a long time, this looked like a good scenario, except that they never controlled that escalation ladder. And now they see themselves and they are actually quite exposed.\n\nAndrew England\n\nAnd of course, in April we saw a tit-for-tat missile exchange between Israel and Iran. Iran fired a barrage of missiles and drones at Israel after Israel struck its diplomatic compound in Damascus and killed several senior Revolutionary Guards commanders. That was seen as a very telegraphed attack. And then Israel struck back, but that was managed. Neither side then displayed any desire to go to a full-blown war. Are we in the same scenario now, or has the calculation changed on either side?\n\nEmile Hokayem\n\nLook, our analysis at the IISS suggests that Iran was looking for a big hit in April, and it was essentially military defeated because of the superior air defences deployed by Israel, the US, the UK, France, Jordan and so on. But at the time, symbolically, the Iranians felt that they had made a point. It was the first nation to attack Israel directly in 40 years. I think now the game is different. I mean, what we seem to have learned from the Israelis is that if an Israeli citizen, whether military or civilian is killed, Israel will lash back. This is what happened a few weeks ago when the hostages managed to hit Israel and killed a civilian. That prompted an Israeli response. So my suspicion this time is everything will depend on the success of the Iranian operation. If they kill even limited numbers of people, Israel will be prompted to escalate again.\n\nAnd so the question right now for all these defence planners in Iran, Beirut and other places is what's the appropriate response? Is that a large barrage of missiles, rockets, UAVs? Is it a ground operation? Is it both at the same time? Is it one wave or several waves? Is it targeted only at military installations or other critical infrastructure or civilian infrastructure? And much will depend on how Iran and Hizbollah define their own victims. You know, the Haniyeh assassination in particular is seen as quite provocative. There are even suggestions that President Biden was very unhappy with it because it scuttled efforts at a ceasefire. You know, if you are an Arab leader, having seen the assassination of Haniyeh, you really want to stick your neck for Israel. These are considerations that are quite significant at present.\n\nAndrew England\n\nWe know Israel boasts the Middle East's most sophisticated army. It gets a massive amount of military support from the US. It's got a very developed indigenous defence industry, very good air defences. How much of a threat to Iran and Hizbollah and other members of the Axis of Resistance pose to Israel? You know, in April, and this time, the US has restated its ironclad commitment to Israel's security, in April, when Iran fired its barrage, a coalition of the US and its allies helped take out the projectiles before they even reached Israel. So how much of a threat are we talking about here from Hizbollah and from Iran?\n\nEmile Hokayem\n\nWell, obviously, Israel has technological superiority and it was demonstrated in April. But Iran has a few advantages as well. First, it has a large and very diverse arsenal. It matters because the goal of Iran, its allies, is to overwhelm Israeli air defences. It's to shoot high and low, fast and slow. Ballistic missiles are different from cruise missiles that are different from UAVs. All this matters, and the fact that it's possible that they will be fired from more than one front also matters. It puts a lot of pressure on Israel's early warning radar systems, batteries and so on. Second point is that Israel is limited in terms of interceptors. I mean, you need a lot of the right stuff to take down those missiles.\n\nAndrew England\n\nThese are the missiles used to take out missiles, right?\n\nEmile Hokayem\n\nExactly. But the point is, the tempo matters. You know what matters as well, geography. Israel is a relatively low country, while Lebanon has valleys and mountains and so on. And so it's difficult for Israeli radar to pick up cruise missiles or in this case, more relevant UAVs. Same thing from Iran, Jordan and so on are higher ground than Israel. So for Israel, you don't necessarily see everything that's coming your way. And the Iranians know that. But, you know, there are other options. What about ground operations? What I'm trying to say is that the Iranians will have to really think hard about their own risk appetites. What is the one thing that could lead to an all-out war that would drag the US into the fight? Benjamin Netanyahu has shamelessly looked for a political victory. You know, he's visited Washington two weeks ago for his speech in Congress. He may have decided that perhaps President Biden is too weak, and Kamala Harris may obstruct some of his plans for later. Perhaps that's the calculation that you should do it now and see what comes. Well, Israel gets all the help it expects from the US and more this time or not.\n\nAndrew England\n\nGiven the US role in all these, I mean, we know that the Biden administration has been working every diplomatic channel it can to de-escalate the situation along with its Arab allies. I mean, how much influence over Israel and just general sort of diplomatic heft does the US have in the region?\n\nEmile Hokayem\n\nI mean, look, the US is definitely struggling. A few months ago, President Biden had put on the table his proposal, and when the US felt that Hamas was the blocker, the US said so. But when it comes to Israel, it's only some leaks that come up, you know, mentioning US frustration. The US has definitely not tried to pressure Israel as much as it could. And the US itself is divided. There are those who will argue there that Israel needs to be given the time and space to get it done, so it doesn't happen again -- their description, not mine. There are others who look at the reputational, political, such as the cost of all that and say we're carrying the risk. We have to deploy aircraft carrier strike groups. We are distracted from Ukraine and China. It's our image that's going south, so we really have to do it. Plus, we care about hostages. While we're not sure that Benjamin Netanyahu does.\n\nBut the point is that all this American anger or disappointment or frustration with Netanyahu is not really translating into policy. They are pleased with the Israelis take the win. You know, you just killed Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh, so declare victory and end it. But as long as these are pleas and non policy pressure, I suspect that they won't succeed significantly. The real game is more, I think, in Israel, where there are tensions building in sides about the course of the war, frustration about the lack of a day after, the societal divides that we saw play out with now the conscription of religious students, or the financial costs of the war, or the unethical behaviour of IDF units in the prisons, or the political and reputational costs of the cases at the ICJ, the International Court of Justice, or the ICC, the International Criminal Court. It may be the case that the US will at one point decide that's it, that's enough. But we've been waiting for that moment for some time.\n\nAndrew England\n\nDoes anyone have leverage over Iran or Hizbollah in this scenario? I mean, who can put pressure on them?\n\nEmile Hokayem\n\nCertainly. I mean, that's a very fair question. I think until the assassination of Fuad Shukr, Hizbollah was willing to accept the ceasefire, not one that would have fully satisfied the Israelis but that would have significantly tamped down the fighting in northern Israel, southern Lebanon. They were just waiting for ceasefire in Gaza. After the assassination of Fuad Shukr, I think Hizbollah doesn't want to hear much. I would argue similar things about Iran, but after the assassination of Haniyeh as well, they want to score points on the battlefield. So I think certainly the ceasefire and hostage deals are in jeopardy for the moment. Perhaps there will be some diplomatic genius somewhere to put it back on track. I suspect between the ceasefire agreement and an escalation short of all-out war, the balance way towards the latter, not the former.\n\nAndrew England\n\nEven if we avoid a serious escalation this time, can a further, broader conflagration, particularly on the northern front, be avoided given Israel's very state desire post-October the 7th to drive Hizbollah back from its border region, the Lebanese-Israeli border? Given the fears in Israel that if Hamas could do what it did on October the 7th, Hizbollah, which is far better armed, far more serious fighting force, could do far more damage if it so choose. Are we basically sort of stuck in this cycle of violence?\n\nEmile Hokayem\n\nThe way it was to me once by a very senior western official, is that the Gaza war is one that Israel didn't plan or prepare for because they thought that the Palestinian question, the Gaza question, was essentially solved. Hamas was contained. The Palestinians were boxed then. However, since 2006, the IDF has been preparing and planning for a revenge war with Hizbollah.\n\nAndrew England\n\nThat's when Hizbollah and Israel fought a 34-day war.\n\nEmile Hokayem\n\nExactly. And the growth in Hizbollah's power, because of its experience in Syria or its acquisition of guided missiles and UAVs and so on, just made it inevitable. And Israelis understand that that's going to be 10 times, 100, 1,000 times costlier and more difficult and bloodier than the fight in Gaza. I would argue that a number of people see it the same way in Lebanon as well. The question is, how do you buy enough time? Is there a way to avoid it through diplomacy? In 2022, a US official managed to get Lebanon and Israel to agree on their maritime border, which at the time many, including myself, thought was unlikely and at the time was seen as a way to not end but freeze this conflict for a while. I think this is firmly in the past, after the Gaza war, and the two parties are going to operate under the assumption that's going to happen. The question is, who decides when it happens?\n\nAnd second, from an Israeli perspective, what are achievable goals? How deep do they have to go into Lebanese territory? Do they have to occupy the country again, as they did from '78 and then '82 to 2000? Or is there a different concept? And from Hizbollah's side, strategically defeating Israel is unlikely, but imposing a cost on Israeli society, eroding its morale and so on. Maybe doable. That would be an interstate war. That would be in diplomatic and other terms. It would be very different than what's happening in Gaza. Lebanon is a tiny country with a failing state, and certainly a place where Hizbollah has forced itself on the rest of the country when it comes to questions of war and peace. But even then, countries like the US, France, Saudi, Qatar, Turkey, Russia and so on will look at a conflict like this one very differently. So it's not as if Israel would have free hands. But again, all this may change. I mean, you mentioned the July rocket attack that cost the lives of 12 Druze children on the Israeli occupied Golan Heights. You know, I doubt that what Hizbollah that day was trying to do was to kill 12 kids. But that's what happens in war. And Hizbollah has been on the back foot ever since. My point is that this is what happens on battlefields. This is why you want to contain the conflict so that incidents like these don't lead to an all-out conflict.\n\nAndrew England\n\nOK, let's end now with the, you know, the million-dollar question. We've had more than seven decades of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We're now into 10 months of the conflict triggered by Hamas's October the 7th attack. And all previous efforts to bring a sustainable resolution to this conflict have failed. We've had almost 40,000 people killed in Gaza since Israel launched its retaliatory offensive, according to Palestinian health officials. What will bring that elusive sustainable peace to the region, and how does this latest spiral of violence end?\n\nEmile Hokayem\n\nThere are those who will argue that it won't end, that what Israel has done in Gaza was to significantly degrade Hamas and has preserved the ability to go into Gaza wherever it wants and do whatever it wants there. Just as what's happening at lower intensity in the West Bank, that Israel wants to preserve its strategic and operational ability to manoeuvre, and it does not need to set along anything that, you know, Israel is not interested in the political track. It may be the case militarily that may be demanding on Israel financially, societally, that perhaps Israeli leaders can convince their population that this is the only way to go forward.\n\nNow, what this approach does not do is to guarantee that Palestinians will submit altogether, either citizens or society or armed groups, you know, including the more extremist of them, Hamas and Islamic Jihad. We can dance around this question forever, but until there is a clear, irreversible path to a Palestinian state that is viable alongside Israel, it's very difficult to see this conflict stabilising in any significant way. There is a grim scenario there, which is that the Gaza Strip right now has been made completely unliveable by the Israeli campaign, and that over the next few years, the life conditions of Palestinians who live in Gaza, it's going to be so bad that they will decide to leave most of them, many of them. And that demographic change in and of itself will transform the nature of that particular aspect of this conflict. This kind of exhaustion, attrition, if it's successful there, perhaps we'll see a repeat of it in some ways in the West Bank. The question then becomes, would the international community agree to it? I think it was in November and December that Tony Blinken, the secretary of state in the US, said no to occupation, nor to the change in the demography of Gaza.\n\nThe question for the Palestinians remains. I mean, you know, they certainly have a right to have a state, but how do they go about building an international consensus about it? I think that's where they're struggling. There is no formula for stripping out Hamas influence from Palestinian society as long as the occupation continues. You can\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009the great Hamas militarily, you can pressure it politically and, you know, make it embarrassed for what it's done to Israelis, of course, but also to Palestinians. But the point is, there's no escape from the fact that to be stabilised, that conflict needs a political solution. And that political solution is a Palestinian state, not a very popular message these days in Israel, for sure, and in probably half of Washington. But elsewhere, I think there is a recognition that waiting forever in the hope that this issue will fizzle out or will vanish into thin air. It's just not viable.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nAndrew England\n\nThat was Emile Hokayem at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, ending this edition of the Rachman Review.

That was the hope among regional leaders gathered at an emergency summit in Jeddah, CNN opined.\n\nSince Hamas' political chief Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran last week, the Iran leaders have vowed vengeance against Israel, whom they claim was responsible. Israel hasn't confirmed or denied responsibility.\n\nAccording to CNN, flights across Iran and its neighbours were cancelled amid fears that missiles could fly any moment, triggering a much-feared escalation of Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nWith his country on the brink of triggering a regional war, Iran's Acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri attended the OIC Summit on Wednesday.\n\nCNN quoted Jordan's foreign minister, Ayman Safadi as saying, \"The first step toward stopping the escalation is ending its root cause, which is the continued Israeli aggression on Gaza.\"\n\nUnited States Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the US has told both- Israel and Iran that \"no one should escalate this conflict\". He added that the ceasefire negotiations have reached \"a final stage\", CNN reported. Blinken added that any tensions in the region can jeopardize the peace talks.\n\nAccording to CNN, Safadi was in Tehran over the weekend and met both Bagheri and Iran's new President Masoud Pezeshkian, and appears to believe that Iran may be looking for an off ramp to escalation.\n\nIran needs diplomatic cover to back away from its threats and a Gaza ceasefire would allow Tehran to claim it cares more for the lives of Palestinians than it does for taking revenge. \"But the payoff needs to be big enough for Iran as its honour and deterrence are at stake,\" CNN said.\n\nAccording to CNN, France's President Emanuel Macron is adding his diplomatic heft, declaring in a phone call with Pezeshkian Wednesday that retaliation against Israel \"has to be abandoned\".\n\nPezeshkian's response suggests he is listening, CNN reported quoting Iran PM, \"If America and Western countries really want to prevent war and insecurity in the region, to prove this claim, they should immediately stop selling arms and supporting the Zionist regime and force this regime to stop the genocide and attacks on Gaza and accept a ceasefire.\"\n\nHowever, Hamas made peace talks with Israel further difficult as it replaced Haniyeh with Yahya Sinwar, the alleged mastermind behind the October 7 attacks, which resulted into the ongoing war.\n\nCNN said that the resolution from OIC will come into effect only if US President Joe Biden meddles, as it can convince Netanyahu.\n\nRiyad Mansour, Palestine's Permanent Observer at the UN said, \"The region does not need escalation. What the region needs is a ceasefire. What the region needs to address legitimate rights. I have a feeling that Prime Minister Netanyahu wants to drag President Biden into a war with Iran,\" he said.\n\nCNN reported that Israel views Iran and Lebanon-based Hezbollah as different hands under the same theological head.\n\nA US official told CNN that they fear Hezbollah may strike Israel, and if the latter retaliates, the whole region may get wrapped in a regional escalation.

But Iran has also shown that it can benefit from chaos. Thus, the killing of Haniyeh - in a government guesthouse just hours after the Hamas leader had attended the inauguration of Iran's new president - could allow Iran to increase its regional influence by harnessing Arab outrage at Israel and fostering Sunni-Shi'ite convergence.\n\nSince the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Tehran has publicly endorsed and championed the Palestinian cause. More broadly, Iran's influence in the Middle East is underpinned by a complex interplay of religious, ideological, political, and regional factors. Benefiting from unresolved regional conflicts, sectarian tensions in neighboring countries and U.S. regime change policies, Iran has meticulously developed a robust network of proxies across the Middle East.\n\nThe Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its elite Quds Force have systematically provided arms, training, and financial assistance to militias and political entities in at least six nations: Bahrain, Iraq, Lebanon, the Palestinian Territories, Syria, and Yemen. Since the outbreak of the Gaza war following Hamas's attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Iran has backed its partner Hezbollah in Lebanon, Shi'ite militias in Iraq and Syria, and the Yemeni Houthis as they have sought to assist Hamas in fighting back at Israel and its main sponsor, the United States.\n\nNow as the region awaits a promised Iranian retaliation for the killing of Haniyeh - and a Hezbollah response to the assassination of a prominent militia leader in Beirut just a few days earlier - Iran is the object of efforts by many countries urging it not to further inflame a region embroiled in a grisly war.\n\nJordan, Syria, and Iraq have all condemned the assassination of Haniyeh as a destabilizing act that threatens regional stability. Jordan's top diplomat made a rare visit to Iran, also driven by concerns about escalation. Qatar, a pivotal mediator in Middle Eastern conflicts, highlighted that the assassination of Hamas's chief negotiator disrupted ongoing efforts to achieve a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nIn Lebanon, caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned Haniyeh's killing as a significant threat to peace. Similarly, Algerian Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf denounced the assassination as \"treacherous and shameful,\" while Egypt highlighted the repercussions of the killing on sovereignty and regional stability.\n\nThe collective condemnations potentially enable Iran to leverage this disapproval to strengthen its influence in the region and the wider Islamic world.\n\nHistorically, Iran's Islamic regime has sought to inspire similar religious uprisings, particularly in its neighborhood. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the 1979 revolution, articulated an even wider ambition, stating, \"We shall export our revolution to the whole world. Until the cry 'there is no god but God' resounds across the globe, the struggle will continue.\"\n\nIranian-Palestinian relations in particular have functioned as a strategic alliance, with Iran seeking to enhance its influence and the dispossessed Palestinians benefiting from state sponsorship. Iran's support for the Palestinian cause is partly ideological, rooted in the religious significance of Jerusalem for Muslims. Since Hamas's 2007 takeover of Gaza, Iran has been a primary supporter, providing financial aid, military technology, and intelligence worth about $300 million annually.\n\nDespite its pan-Islamic rhetoric, Iran also seeks to consolidate the position of fellow Shi'ite Muslims, as evidenced by its assistance in creating Hezbollah in Lebanon after the 1982 Israeli invasion of that country, the financing and training of various militia groups in Iraq, backing the Houthis in Yemen, and ensuring the survival of the Assad regime in Syria. Yet Iran seeks to avoid being perceived as the standard-bearer of Shi'ites alone.\n\nThe alliance with various Palestinian groups consolidates Iran's role as a steadfast advocate of the Palestinian cause. Iran may even seek to leverage the assassination of Haniyeh - a humiliating security failure - to continue to position itself as the indispensable champion of the Palestinian struggle.\n\nBeyond the statements of support that Iran has received since Haniyeh's death, the assassination and the Gaza war might favor Iran's strategic position.\n\nThe Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Persian Gulf states, were under pressure already because of the deaths of 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza. The killing of Haniyeh might spark further public backlash, putting pressure on governments in the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan to reconsider their ties with Israel.\n\nAlready, prospects for extending the accords to Saudi Arabia are on the back burner, while the UAE has expressed \"deep concern over the continued escalation and its repercussions on security and stability in the region,\" emphasizing the need for \"maximum restraint and wisdom.\" Similarly, Bahrain has highlighted the \"dangerous repercussions on regional security and stability,\" calling for an immediate end to the conflict and urging the international community to support de-escalation efforts.\n\nSaudi Arabia has been trying to balance its strategic interest in a defense relationship with Israel, aimed at countering Iranian influence, with the widespread pro-Palestinian sentiment among its population and the broader Muslim world. Its willingness to host the emergency OIC meeting in Jeddah illustrated this juggling act. It might also increase diplomatic support for the Palestinian Authority and financial aid to Palestinian refugees.\n\nThe assassination of Haniyeh was a geopolitical earthquake with the potential to reshape regional dynamics. Iran's support for a so-called \"Axis of Resistance\" has put it into jeopardy as tensions rise with Israel and the two countries' long-time \"shadow war\" breaks out into the open. At the same time, however, Iran's backing of the Palestinian cause disrupts U.S. and regional efforts to contain Tehran and forces Persian Gulf states to reassess their ties with Israel amid a public backlash against mounting Palestinian deaths. How Iran maneuvers in this crisis will be pivotal in defining its future regional role.", "source": {"uri": "stimson.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stimson Center"}, "authors": [{"uri":

subjected to daily attacks by thousands of missiles and drones, says Yitzhak Barik\n\nIf Israel launches a preemptive strike against Hezbollah and Iran, it will trigger a regional war that Tel Aviv would be unable to fight effectively without US support, Israeli Reserve General Itzhak Brik said Wednesday, the Hebrew Channel 12 reported.\n\nConcerns are growing about the outbreak of a comprehensive regional war following Israel's assassination of top Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in an airstrike on a suburb of Beirut on July 30 and the assassination of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in the Iranian capital Tehran the next day in an attack attributed to Tel Aviv, despite it not claiming responsibility.\n\nBrik said that in recent days, some people have failed to understand the concerning condition of the Israeli army, suggesting that Iran and Hezbollah should be attacked preemptively before they strike Israel.\n\nHe expressed concern that those advocating for a preemptive strike fail to consider that such an action would immediately trigger a regional war.\n\nHe emphasized that the Israeli army does not have the capacity to respond to a regional war, neither in defending this national infrastructure nor in defeating Iran, Hezbollah and their proxies.\n\nHe added that some argue a preemptive strike could provide an advantage in an inevitable regional war.\n\nHowever, Brik countered that a pre-emptive strike will certainly bring about a regional war, while the reactions of Iran and Hezbollah, if they are minor, \"will not necessarily drag us into a regional war.\"\n\nHe noted that the Israeli army alone lacks a winning strategy for a regional war, even if it starts with a preemptive strike, and thus requires US support.\n\nBrik also emphasized that Israel's dependence on the US is crucial for its resilience in such a conflict.\n\nHe added that Israel cannot endure or win the war without US assistance.", "source": {"uri": "yenisafak.com",

unable to fight effectively without US support, Israeli Reserve General Yitzhak Brik said Wednesday, the Hebrew Channel 12 reported.\n\nConcerns are growing about the outbreak of a comprehensive regional war following Israel's assassination of top Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in an airstrike on a suburb of Beirut on July 30 and the assassination of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in the Iranian capital Tehran the next day in an attack attributed to Tel Aviv, despite it not claiming responsibility.\n\nIran and Hezbollah have vowed a \"strong and effective\" response to the assassinations while attempts are being made to calm the situation through regional contacts and moves.\n\nBrik said that in recent days, some people have failed to understand the concerning condition of the Israeli army, suggesting that Iran and Hezbollah should be attacked preemptively before they strike Israel.\n\nHe expressed concern that those advocating for a preemptive strike fail to consider that such an action would immediately trigger a regional war.\n\nBrik said that if Israel launches a preemptive war, its population centers, power stations, gas platforms, transportation infrastructure, industrial infrastructure and army bases will be subjected to daily attacks by thousands of missiles and drones.\n\nHe emphasized that the Israeli army does not have the capacity to respond to a regional war, neither in defending this national infrastructure nor in defeating Iran, Hezbollah and their proxies.\n\nHe added that some argue a preemptive strike could provide an advantage in an inevitable regional war.\n\nHowever, Brik countered that a pre-emptive strike will certainly bring about a regional war, while the reactions of Iran and Hezbollah, if they are minor, \"will not necessarily drag us into a regional war.\"\n\nHe noted that the Israeli army alone lacks a winning strategy for a regional war, even if it starts with a preemptive strike, and thus requires US support.\n\nBrik also emphasized that Israel's dependence on the US is crucial for its resilience in such a conflict.\n\nHe added that Israel cannot endure or win the war without US assistance.",

Initially, diplomatic efforts tried to contain the situation. Tensions grew after the Israeli military killed Hamas leader Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut's southern suburbs in early January. This led to a flurry of diplomatic activity aimed at preventing the war from spreading.\n\nThe third phase came after Israel's killing of Iranian Revolutionary Guard leaders at the Iranian consulate in Damascus and Iran's retaliation. The fourth phase is unfolding now, with Israel recently assassinating Hezbollah leader Fuad Shukr in Beirut's southern suburbs and Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\n\nThis has left Lebanon in suspense, with everyday life paused as everyone waits for responses from Iran, Hezbollah, and Israel.\n\nThe strategies of both sides have shifted. Hezbollah thought that attacking northern Israeli settlements would force Israel to stop its assault on Gaza and meet its demands.\n\nHowever, Hezbollah's goals were not met. On the other hand, the Israeli military believed that its strikes in Lebanon and Syria would make Hezbollah retreat and comply with Resolution 1701 by withdrawing north of the Litani River. This has not happened, despite international pressure.\n\nWhenever tensions rose, diplomatic efforts were made to prevent the conflict from widening. These efforts succeeded in stopping the war from expanding before the recent assassinations of Shukr and Haniyeh but failed to de-escalate or end the current conflict.\n\nA diplomatic source, speaking under the conditions of anonymity, told Asharq Al-Awsat that international efforts have not yet managed to ease the tensions between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nLebanon is now facing crucial and challenging days as it awaits Hezbollah's response to the assassinations and Israel's reaction.\n\nThe source pointed out that embassy closures and urgent evacuation warnings from Western embassies underline the serious risks, signaling that any major attack on Israel could have severe consequences for Lebanon.\n\nThe source hopes that all parties understand that the ongoing diplomatic efforts are the last chance to avoid a wider war.\n\nAs Lebanon waits for Hezbollah's response to the killing of Shukr and Iran's reaction to the assassination of Haniyeh, the country is facing high tension.\n\nWestern and Arab embassies have urgently advised their citizens to leave Lebanon, and most airlines have suspended flights to Beirut International Airport.", "source": {"uri": "english.aawsat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asharq Al-Awsat English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quds_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quds Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasem_Soleimani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qasem Soleimani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litani_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Litani River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Revolutionary_Guard_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli settlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damascus"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Damascus"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Syria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://static.srpcdigital.com/styles/1200x600/public/2024-08/741987_0.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799808", "eventUri": "eng-9799808", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

AP\n\nThe night of July 30 may have changed the West Asian region forever. On this fateful night, three strikes across three capitals in the region led to two key assassinations. Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh, who was in Tehran for the inauguration of Iran's newly elected president Masoud Pezeshkian, was assassinated in a targeted strike at his residence in a closely guarded area of Tehran. In Beirut, a precision airstrike took out senior Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr, who Israel had blamed for the missile attack in the occupied Golan Heights on July 27, which led to the death of 12 Israeli citizens.\n\nElsewhere, in Baghdad, a missile attack by US forces targeted a base south of the city used by Iran-backed Iraqi Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), killing four members of the group.\n\nA day later, on 1 August, Israel claimed it had also eliminated Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif in an airstrike carried out in Khan Younis city in Gaza on July 13. Earlier, on July 20, Israeli fighter aircraft had targeted the port city of Hodeidah in Yemen, which is controlled by the Houthis, setting a major oil storage dump on fire and killing six people.\n\nWith Israel being blamed for all the strikes, the Gaza war, which has been oscillating between hopes of a ceasefire and continuing death and destruction, may have just crossed a critical threshold. It may no longer be possible to keep the conflict isolated to Gaza. This is especially relevant in view of Iran's announcement, after a brief military spat with Israel in April this year, that \"the era of strategic patience is over\" and that any Israeli assaults will be met with a \"direct\" response.\n\nFollowing the assassinations, the response was led by none other than Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who was firm and clear about seeking revenge. The leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, also vowed severe retaliation against Israel.\n\nA strike by Iran and its allies thus seems inevitable; it is only a question of 'when' and 'how'. As the region awaits the inevitable, it may be relevant to examine the military capabilities of each side to better understand how such strikes could unfold.\n\nMilitary capabilities\n\nIran is the main protagonist in the anticipated strike. For years, it has relied on its proxies in the region to wage war on its behalf, but this time, it is likely to undertake a direct strike. As Iran and Israel are separated by almost 1,800 km, a ground war or \"boots on the ground\" is unlikely. Therefore, military power projection will be through standoff weapon systems like drones and missiles.\n\nRegarding airpower, Iran has a poorly equipped and ageing fleet. Its air force comprises an array of aircraft, ranging from US-made F-14s to Chinese F-4s, F-5s, and F-7s, along with Russian Sukhois and MiG-29s. Most estimates suggest a total of 330-350 aircraft. Although Iran has been asking Russia to supply Sukhoi-35 fighter jets, this is unlikely to materialise soon.\n\nIt is Iran's missile technology, however, that is potent and lethal. Iran's array of missiles is the largest and most diverse in the region. Many are reported to be inherently capable of carrying nuclear payloads. Iran has an arsenal of medium- and long-range ballistic missiles that can be launched from Iran itself, while shorter-range missiles can be fired from Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon. Iran possesses the Khorramshahr-1, 2, and 3, which are MRBMs with ranges of 2,000 to 3,000 km, the Fatah-1 with ranges of 1,400 to 1,700 km, and many others, such as the Sejjil (2,000 km) and Paveh (1,650 km). It is estimated that Iran has also developed the Khyber Shikan missile, a more advanced version from the Fatah-1 family of missiles.\n\nIn addition, Iran has developed hypersonic missiles, which fly at speeds of Mach 5 and are beyond the interception capability of most anti-missile systems. Russia has used these missiles in Ukraine with great success. Iran also has cruise missiles, such as the Kh-55, with a range of up to 3,000 km.\n\nIran possesses a large variety of drones as well, having mastered the art and science of developing low-cost, low-technology drones. Prominent among these is the Shahed category of drones, which are suicide or kamikaze drones meant to explode on their targets. Shahed-131s were used when the Houthis targeted Saudi oil fields and airfields in 2019. The improved version, the Shahed-136 drone, has a longer range of over 1,500 miles and can carry 20-40 kg of explosives. The Shahed-238 drone has jet propulsion, making it faster and capable of carrying heavier payloads. There are also the Samad-1, 2, and 3 categories of drones, which have effective ranges of 1,800 km and can carry substantial payloads.\n\nHezbollah\n\nHezbollah, or \"The Party of God\", is the world's most heavily armed non-state group and has been described as \"a militia trained like an army and equipped like a state\". This Iran-backed group possesses more than 150,000 missiles and rockets, according to the World Factbook of the US Central Intelligence Agency, which can hit almost all of Israel. Many of its weapons are Iranian, with some also drawn from Russian or Chinese models. Although Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah claims to have 100,000 fighters, most estimates suggest it has up to 45,000.\n\nUnguided rockets, such as Katyusha missiles with a range of 30 km, comprise the bulk of Hezbollah's missile arsenal. It also possesses Iranian models, such as Raad (Arabic for \"thunder\"), Fajr (\"dawn\") and Zilzal (\"earthquake\") rockets, which have a more powerful payload and longer range than Katyushas. In the ongoing war in Gaza, Hezbollah has fired Katyushas and Burkan (\"volcano\") missiles, with an explosive payload of 300-500 kg, at Israel. It has also used Iranian-made Falaq-2 rockets, which were used for the first time in June this year and which carry a larger warhead than the previously used Falaq-1.\n\nHezbollah uses anti-tank missiles, including the Russian-made Kornet, which have proved very effective against tanks and armoured personnel carriers. It has also reportedly used an Iranian-made guided missile known as \"al-Mas\", which can hit targets beyond the line of sight, enabling it to strike from above. Hezbollah successfully used anti-tank missiles during its 2006 war with Israel, when it struck nearly 50 Israeli Merkava tanks.\n\nAlthough Hezbollah is known to possess Soviet-era anti-aircraft gun systems, such as the ZU-23, OSA, Strella, Igla, and Pantsyr S-1, it is only during the current Gaza war that it has downed Israeli drones - including the Hermes 450 and Hermes 900 - using surface-to-air missiles.\n\nHezbollah also utilises one-way explosive drones, as well as drones that drop bombs and return to Lebanon. These are mostly short-range drones supplied by Iran, along with locally assembled Ayoub and Mersad models, which analysts say are cheap and relatively easy to produce.\n\nIn addition to its stand-off weapons, Hezbollah has a well-trained and highly motivated 'Special Forces' too who are well trained in guerilla warfare. Having fought Israel in 2006 and in constant state of conflict since then, these are battle hardened and capable of inflicting damage through raids.\n\nHouthis\n\nThe military capability of the Houthis is basically centered on two types of weapon platforms -- UAVs and ballistic and cruise missiles. Most of the acquisitions and developments in its arsenal are through Iran. Their initial inventory comprised Russian P-21 and P-22 missiles and Chinese C-801 missiles, both taken over from the Yemeni armed forces.\n\nThe Houthis have the Typhoon missile, a rebranded version of the Iranian Qadr missile, with a range of 1,600 to 1,900 km. It was unveiled in a military parade weeks before the onset of the Gaza war. They also possess the Quds-2 cruise missile, with a range of 1,200 km. They may also possess a version of the Chinese C-802 (YJ-82/CH-SS-N-6 Saccade) anti-ship cruise missile (ASCM). According to the Military Balance 2024 report, the Houthis have developed more ASCMs, which were unveiled during military parades in 2023, including two anti-ship versions of the Iranian Quds/351 LACM. Both systems have a range of at least 800 km.\n\nThe Houthis have also unveiled a variety of anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs) and guided rockets employing Iranian infrared or imaging infrared seeker technology. These include the 450 km-range Asef, a rebranded ASBM version of Iran's Fateh-313 missile, and the Tankil missile, a rebranded anti-ship version of the IRGC-developed 500 km-range Zohayr. There are reportedly three smaller ASBMs as well: the 140 km-range Faleq, the Mayun, and the Bahr al-Ahmar.\n\nRegarding drones, the Houthi drone inventory includes the Iranian Shahed-136 drone, which has a range of about 2,000 kilometres. The Houthis also possess Iranian-made Samad-2 and Samad-3 drones, which have a range of around 1,500 km and carry a payload of about 20 kg. The drone used by the Houthis in their recent attack on Tel Aviv in July is called the \"Yafa\". This seems to be an upgraded and locally modified version of the Samad-3, designed to increase its range and help it avoid detection.\n\nHamas\n\nHamas is the third component of the \"3Hs\", supported by Iran. It does not have any conventional forces or weapons. Its fighters are estimated to number around 25,000 to 30,000 and are primarily trained in guerrilla warfare and terrorist tactics. Hamas has been fighting the Gaza war with Israel since October 2023 and has suffered major damage and casualties, but it remains resilient and effective.\n\nApart from basic hand-held weapons, Hamas is known to possess an array of short-range rockets, including the Russian-made Kornet platform and the Iranian Fajr family of anti-tank weapons. It is also known to have Iranian-made Fateh-110 ballistic missiles, which have a range of up to 185 miles. It uses fast-moving light vehicles, such as jeeps, pickup trucks, and motorbikes. Its general modus operandi involves the use of tunnels deep under the Gaza fence, the placement of IEDs, and the carrying out of spectacular attacks in Israel.\n\nOther Militias in Iraq and Syria\n\nIran also has support from various militia groups in Iraq and Syria. Most prominent among these are the Iraqi Shiite militias known as the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF). These groups have repeatedly attacked US troops in Iraq -- over 60 times -- since the start of the Gaza war. Apart from the drone strike on January 28 on a facility known as Tower 22 in Jordan, on the Syrian border, which killed three US troops, a rocket attack on the Al-Asad US airbase in western Iraq injured five US soldiers as recently as August 6.\n\nThe wait for the retaliation\n\nThe military capability of the \"Axis of Resistance\" is thus very effective, and it has been demonstrated more than once that its weapon systems can penetrate the formidable Israeli defences. Even on high alert, anticipating a retaliatory strike, three out of four drones from south Lebanon were able to penetrate Israeli defences on August 6 and explode in northern Israel.\n\nIsrael will clearly be banking on its early warning systems and anti-missile defence systems, including the long-range MIM-104 Patriot PAC-2, with a range of 160 km, and the short-range Iron Dome (anti-rocket system), David's Sling, and the famous Arrow air defence systems.\n\nThe US has already moved an aircraft carrier battle group into the region. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Jordan have declared that they will not permit Iran or its proxies to use their airspace to carry out an attack, thereby giving proxy support to Israel.\n\nIran, on the other hand, is determined to retaliate. It has already informed the UN that it will carry out a retaliatory attack on Israel in self-defence against violations of its national security and territorial integrity, citing Article 51 of the UN Charter. The world waits as Israel braces for an unprecedented and coordinated attack, while the region faces the prospect of an escalated conflict spreading far beyond Gaza - one that promises to alter the security landscape of the region forever.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The only questions are when, where and how far will Iran go, which leads to its own supplemental question: how dangerous will this situation now become?\n\nIran's intention to retaliate was announced on July 7 by acting foreign minister, Ali Bagheri-Kani, at an extraordinary session of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Saudi Arabia. Bagheri-Kani told the meeting: \"In the absence of appropriate action by the [United Nations] security council against the aggressions and violations of the Israeli regime, the Islamic Republic of Iran has no choice but to exercise its inherent right to legitimate defense against this regime's actions.\"\n\nIsrael is convening an emergency meeting of its security cabinet to discuss how to prepare for this retaliation. According to Middle East analysts at the Institute for the Study of War, this is being made more difficult for Israel's security agencies by Iran's armed forces media which is publishing a range of different information. The aim, they believe, is to \"decrease Israel's ability to effectively defend against an Iranian attack by causing Israel to disperse its air and missile-defense assets\".\n\nGaza Update is available as a fortnightly email newsletter.

Where Haniyeh was the pragmatic face of Hamas, his successor, Yahya Sinwar, is widely understood to be the architect of the October 7 attacks and is viewed as one of the group's most extreme figures. He has, after all, spent 23 years of his life in Israeli prisons and has been directing the operations of militants inside the Gaza Strip since the start of the war.\n\nAccording to Leonie Fleischmann of City, University of London, Sinwar's appointment sends a clear message to Israel that killing the group's leaders will not weaken Hamas but will instead strengthen its resolve to hold on to Gaza and continue engaging in a violent struggle.\n\nWith Sinwar taking the reins, a ceasefire in Gaza looks to have become even more remote - he reportedly has closer ties to Iran and is more aggressive than other Hamas leaders. But, in Fleischmann's view, the fact that ceasefire hopes have been dimmed are not entirely surprising when you take the position of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, into account.\n\nNetanyahu has been regularly criticised, from both inside Israel and more widely, for prolonging the assault on Gaza in order to ensure his own political survival. His apparent sanctioning of Haniyeh's assassination - Israel has not claimed responsibility for the killing - may have been yet another attempt to derail the ceasefire negotiations, Fleischmann says.\n\nRead more:\n\nCeasefire in Gaza more remote with the assassination of Haniyeh and promotion of Sinwar\n\nThis is a view shared by Scott Lucas, an expert on international politics at University College Dublin. He argues that the war has landed Netanyahu in deep trouble. Netanyahu has so far failed on his pledge to \"destroy\" Hamas, and Israeli troops appears to be stuck in perpetual operations in full view of a mainly disapproving world.\n\nThe high-profile killing of \"enemies\" in Haniyeh and Shukr may have bought Netanyahu some time, he says. But it's a gamble for the Israeli prime minister. The political dynamic in Washington - once Israel's most staunch friend - shifted when the US president, Joe Biden, a longtime and stalwart supporter, announced he would not contest the next election.\n\nA lot will depend on who wins in November. As we have reported here, Biden's replacement at the top of the Democratic Party's ticket, Kamala Harris, has a far more nuanced attitude to the conflict in Gaza and has already publicly declared that she wants a ceasefire sooner rather than later, with a two-state solution firmly on the table.\n\nRead more:\n\nAssassination of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders is a gamble for Benjamin Netanyahu that buys him time but risks wider wars\n\nOver the past ten months, as the conflict in Gaza has raged, Israel (and the US) and Iran (and its proxies in Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon and Syria) have also engaged in a sporadic, tit-for-tat series of strike and counter-strike. Most of this has been carefully calibrated to keep the hostilities alive, while avoiding escalation into all-out war, something neither side has wanted.\n\nBut the rocket which hit a football game in a village in the Golan Heights on July 27 changed all that. The strike killed 12 children and teenagers, all between the ages of ten and 20, injuring at least 29 others. Erika Jiminez, Leverhulme early career fellow at the School of Law, at Queen's University Belfast, who has been conducting research in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, warns that it has greatly increased the complexity of the situation.\n\nIsrael captured the Golan Heights from Syria after the six-day war in 1967 and has occupied the strategically important region ever since, declaring the rocky 1,000 square kilometre plateau to be part of Israel in 1981. The vast majority of the Syrian population fled in 1967, but about 20,000 inhabitants remained - mainly Syrian Druze people. The Druze are a minority Arab sect with about a million members spread across the Middle East, who don't believe in inter-marriage and don't allow outsiders to join the religion.\n\nAs Jiminez explains, despite being given Israeli identity papers, they have steadfastly refused to take up Israeli nationality. But notwithstanding, Netanyahu lost no time in blaming Hezbollah for the attack and vowed they would pay a \"hefty price\".\n\nRead more:\n\nRocket attack kills 12 children in Golan Heights - who are the Druze who live there?\n\nWhether we will now see a wider regional conflict is difficult to say: all parties are making ominous noises. But, according to Ian Parmeter of Australian National University, the death of particularly Haniyeh is likely to have caused enormous anger in Iran and it has pushed the whole region onto a knife's edge.\n\nIn his view, Iranian retaliation is most likely to come through Hezbollah. But Parmeter says that Iran also has other allies on which it can call, including Shia militant groups in Syria and Iraq, as well as the Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nWe've seen that Iran has declared its intention to seek revenge for the assassinations. The question now remains when it will come and what will be the consequences.\n\nRead more:\n\nHamas leader's killing in Tehran likely to further escalate violence in Middle East\n\nGaza Update is available as a fortnightly email newsletter.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) introducing a resolution to authorize the use of U.S. armed forces against Iran, Congressman Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) said on social media Saturday that \"the U.S. must not be dragged into a war with Iran.\"\n\n\"The Iraq War was the biggest American blunder of the 21st century,\" Khanna added. \"Every candidate running this cycle must be clear on where they stand on this.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) said early Sunday: \"I agree with Ro Khanna. No war with Iran! Let's all get on record with this.\"\n\nHassan El-Tayyab, legislative director for Middle East policy at the Friends Committee on National Legislation, urged Khanna to introduce a related war powers resolution, arguing that \"we really could use a clear vehicle like this to increase the pressure for no U.S. military intervention in a disastrous war with Iran.\"\n\nSince Hamas, the Palestinian political and militant group that has controlled the Gaza Strip for nearly two decades, led the October 7 attack on Israel, Israeli forces -- backed by diplomatic and weapons support from U.S. President Joe Biden and Congress -- have killed at least 39,583 people in the coastal enclave and injured another 91,398, according to local officials.\n\nThe government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu -- which faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice over Gaza -- has elevated fears of a regional war this week with an airstrike targeting Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut, Lebanon and the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh at his residence in the Iranian capital of Tehran.\n\nBy killing Haniyeh, \"Netanyahu has systematically sabotaged cease-fire talks because ending the war will likely end his political career,\" Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, said Wednesday.\n\n\"Here we go again. Scrambling to prevent total war by pressing Iran not to retaliate,\" Parsi said Sunday, pointing to the final paragraph of a New York Times opinion piece he wrote in April about a conflict that began with an attack on Iran's diplomatic compound in Syria. \"Had Biden forced a Gaza cease-fire, we wouldn't perpetually be on the precipice of war.\"\n\nParsi had argued earlier this year that \"Mr. Biden has pursued policies that have pushed the Middle East to the precipice of war. His tactical successes in avoiding the worst outcomes of his policies should not be belittled. But they can never make up for his government's broader failure to pursue a strategy that brings real security to America and real peace to the Middle East.\"\n\nParsi also highlighted a social media thread from Suzanne DiMaggio, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who said Sunday that \"similar de-escalation/crisis management efforts that helped to defuse the Israel-Iran confrontation in April... are in motion again -- only this time, the situation is far more complex and dangerous.\"\n\n\"Stumbling from one escalatory cycle to another and relying heavily on luck to avert a full-blown regional war is unsustainable and irresponsible,\" she warned. \"We're a miscalculation or a miscue away from an event that could draw the U.S. and Iran into a direct military conflict.\"\n\n\"Hoping that cooler heads will prevail time and time again is not a strategy. The diplomatic off-ramps to break the cycle are clear and begin with securing a cease-fire agreement and hostage release in Gaza,\" she continued. \"As we saw during the humanitarian pause in late 2023, every Iranian proxy and aligned group stood down during this period. In addition to ending the bloodshed and massive suffering, a cease-fire would calm the situation in the region, providing time and space for negotiations, large-scale aid, and the rebuilding of Gaza.\"\n\nHaniyeh's assassination -- the details of which are being disputed -- has Israel preparing for potential retaliation from Iran and its proxies. Netanyahu on Sunday told a Cabinet meeting that Israel is already in a \"multifront war\" with both.\n\nAccording toThe Associated Press, which reported on the prime minister's remarks:\n\n\"Netanyahu said Israel was ready for any scenario. Jordan's foreign minister was making a rare trip to Iran as part of diplomatic efforts -- \"We want the escalation to end,\" Ayman Safadi said -- while the Pentagon has moved significant assets to the region.\n\n\"We are doing everything possible to make sure that this situation does not boil over,\" White House deputy national security adviser Jon Finer told ABC.\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed Friday that it was deploying additional military resources to the Middle East, despite reported tension between Biden and Netanyahu, who was in Washington, D.C. last month to address Congress and meet with key U.S. leaders.\n\nCiting an unnamed Biden administration official, Haaretzreported Saturday that the most recent conversations between Biden and Netanyahu, including one at the White House, \"were difficult and tense.\"\n\nAs the Israeli newspaper detailed:\n\n\"Biden realized that Netanyahu was lying to him about the hostages,\" the official told Haaretz. \"He's not saying it publicly yet, but in the meeting between them, he specifically told him, 'Stop bullshitting me.'\"\n\nThe official said that the U.S. is preparing to help Israel in the face of Iran and Hezbollah's response to the assassinations that Israel carried out last week in Beirut and Tehran -- despite the tension between the two leaders -- but made it clear that there would be no American backing for moves that would further expand the scope of the conflict.\n\n\"Netanyahu is trying to prolong the war instead of focusing on how to get to a hostage deal,\" the official said. \"It's making it harder for us to continue supporting Israel over time.\"\n\nResponding to the reporting on social media, Parsi said: \"In a shocking turn of events, an Israeli prime minister who has lied to every American president since Bill Clinton, turns around and ** drum roll ** lies to Biden! It took Biden 10 months to 'realize' he was being lied to. TEN MONTHS!!!\"", "source": {"uri": "defenddemocracy.press", "dataType": "news", "title": "defenddemocracy.press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ro_Khanna",

That was the hope among regional leaders gathered at an emergency summit in Jeddah, CNN opined.\n\nAlso Read | Australia Shocker: Sydney Female Teacher Has Sex With Student in Her Car, Sends Video Pleasuring Herself to Minor; Suspended.\n\nSince Hamas' political chief Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran last week, the Iran leaders have vowed vengeance against Israel, whom they claim was responsible. Israel hasn't confirmed or denied responsibility.\n\nAccording to CNN, flights across Iran and its neighbours were cancelled amid fears that missiles could fly any moment, triggering a much-feared escalation of Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nAlso Read | Muhammad Yunus Takes Oath of Office As Head of Bangladesh's Interim Government, To Seek Peace and Prepare New Elections.\n\nWith his country on the brink of triggering a regional war, Iran's Acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri attended the OIC Summit on Wednesday.\n\nCNN quoted Jordan's foreign minister, Ayman Safadi as saying, \"The first step toward stopping the escalation is ending its root cause, which is the continued Israeli aggression on Gaza.\"\n\nUnited States Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the US has told both- Israel and Iran that \"no one should escalate this conflict\". He added that the ceasefire negotiations have reached \"a final stage\", CNN reported. Blinken added that any tensions in the region can jeopardize the peace talks.\n\nAccording to CNN, Safadi was in Tehran over the weekend and met both Bagheri and Iran's new President Masoud Pezeshkian, and appears to believe that Iran may be looking for an off ramp to escalation.\n\nIran needs diplomatic cover to back away from its threats and a Gaza ceasefire would allow Tehran to claim it cares more for the lives of Palestinians than it does for taking revenge. \"But the payoff needs to be big enough for Iran as its honour and deterrence are at stake,\" CNN said.\n\nAccording to CNN, France's President Emanuel Macron is adding his diplomatic heft, declaring in a phone call with Pezeshkian Wednesday that retaliation against Israel \"has to be abandoned\".\n\nPezeshkian's response suggests he is listening, CNN reported quoting Iran PM, \"If America and Western countries really want to prevent war and insecurity in the region, to prove this claim, they should immediately stop selling arms and supporting the Zionist regime and force this regime to stop the genocide and attacks on Gaza and accept a ceasefire.\"\n\nHowever, Hamas made peace talks with Israel further difficult as it replaced Haniyeh with Yahya Sinwar, the alleged mastermind behind the October 7 attacks, which resulted into the ongoing war.\n\nCNN said that the resolution from OIC will come into effect only if US President Joe Biden meddles, as it can convince Netanyahu.\n\nRiyad Mansour, Palestine's Permanent Observer at the UN said, \"The region does not need escalation. What the region needs is a ceasefire. What the region needs to address legitimate rights. I have a feeling that Prime Minister Netanyahu wants to drag President Biden into a war with Iran,\" he said.\n\nCNN reported that Israel views Iran and Lebanon-based Hezbollah as different hands under the same theological head.\n\nA US official told CNN that they fear Hezbollah may strike Israel, and if the latter retaliates, the whole region may get wrapped in a regional escalation.

In the case of Iran's relationship with Israel, the question of when Iran will attack Israel dominates the agenda of global media, growing more urgent with each passing day and hour.\n\nWars throughout history often erupt when tensions peak, the risk is immense, and when conflict between two nations threatens to engulf humanity. In times like these, when discussions of war dominate the discourse, I sense that the possibility of peace might emerge unexpectedly.\n\nWhen the speech of Israeli Prime Minister Benajmin Netanyahu, seemingly possessed by the spirit of Hitler, received a standing ovation at the U.S. Capitol, it was more than just a gesture of support; it symbolized American approval of the killing of 40,000 civilians and an endorsement of Netanyahu's atrocities. While this may be rooted in American domestic politics and despite the well-known affiliation of all American senators and representatives with the Jewish organization American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), it is still difficult to accept that the entire U.S. Congress could be enslaved by Zionism. It may sound like a joke, but those familiar with the inner workings of the United States know this is the reality.\n\nNetanyahu's standing ovation is not only an endorsement of the killing of 40,000 civilians and his various atrocities, but it is also an endorsement of the further madness to come.\n\nIn these circumstances, Israel's killing of Hezbollah's chief of staff and the assassination of Hamas political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh, the negotiator representing Hamas in Doha, indicate that war seems inevitable and that apocalyptic scenarios are becoming the only foreseeable outcome.\n\nHowever, the seriousness of the threat posed by Iran and Hezbollah has prompted the U.S. and the countries of the region, particularly Egypt and T\u00fcrkiye, to look for ways to stop this war and its course.\n\nOne of the remedies sought is an accelerated and limited Iranian intervention, which could raise the option of discussing a permanent process between Hezbollah and Israel. But the anger on both sides is immense, and there seems to be only one way out.\n\nIf a permanent cease-fire between Hamas and Netanyahu were to be established, Hezbollah might adopt a cautious stance, and Iran could potentially endorse the agreement. In light of recent setbacks, Iran and Hezbollah might choose to remain passive in the face of such a peace initiative, with Iran acknowledging its recent losses and Hezbollah similarly refraining from opposition due to its own challenges.\n\nHowever, when states with a long-standing tradition face significant challenges or perceive a humiliating intervention, they often channel their frustrations toward other states. This pattern is evident in historical and contemporary contexts, such as the strained relations between Russia and the U.S. or T\u00fcrkiye's periodic confrontations with adversaries. Historically and presently, significant powers tend to uphold a sense of dignity and, over time, may eventually seek revenge for perceived insults or injustices.\n\nIf there is a peace negotiation between Israel and Hamas and it is concluded in a just manner, both Hezbollah and Iran would be willing to go along with it.\n\nOften, the prevailing scenario involves a sequence where Iran launches attacks on Israel, the U.S. retaliates against Iran, and the Mediterranean and the Middle East spiral into a conflict-ridden crisis. However, considering the current global situation, the world is not in a state that can endure a significant war in the Middle East. The geopolitical and economic pressures of today make such a conflict particularly untenable.\n\nIn anticipation of a potential Iranian attack, significant disruptions have occurred in stock markets across the U.S., the Far East, Japan, and other regions. There has been a surge in emergency oil purchases as markets brace for possible shortages. Should a conflict erupt, particularly with U.S. involvement, the situation in the region could rapidly escalate into a severe crisis, with profound implications for global stability and economic conditions.\n\nRecently, T\u00fcrkiye has been intensifying its diplomatic efforts. In this regard, it would be wise for T\u00fcrkiye to contemplate the renewal of peace with Israel. This strategy could help prevent a significant conflict and offer an opportunity to reshape regional dynamics.\n\nShould the United States, T\u00fcrkiye, Egypt, and other influential countries intensify their efforts, Russia and China might also take a favorable stance.

Initially, diplomatic efforts tried to contain the situation. Tensions grew after the Israeli military killed Hamas leader Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut's southern suburbs in early January. This led to a flurry of diplomatic activity aimed at preventing the war from spreading.\n\nThe third phase came after Israel's killing of Iranian Revolutionary Guard leaders at the Iranian consulate in Damascus and Iran's retaliation. The fourth phase is unfolding now, with Israel recently assassinating Hezbollah leader Fuad Shukr in Beirut's southern suburbs and Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\n\nThis has left Lebanon in suspense, with everyday life paused as everyone waits for responses from Iran, Hezbollah, and Israel.\n\nThe strategies of both sides have shifted. Hezbollah thought that attacking northern Israeli settlements would force Israel to stop its assault on Gaza and meet its demands.\n\nHowever, Hezbollah's goals were not met. On the other hand, the Israeli military believed that its strikes in Lebanon and Syria would make Hezbollah retreat and comply with Resolution 1701 by withdrawing north of the Litani River. This has not happened, despite international pressure.\n\nWhenever tensions rose, diplomatic efforts were made to prevent the conflict from widening. These efforts succeeded in stopping the war from expanding before the recent assassinations of Shukr and Haniyeh but failed to de-escalate or end the current conflict.\n\nA diplomatic source, speaking under the conditions of anonymity, told Asharq Al-Awsat that international efforts have not yet managed to ease the tensions between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nLebanon is now facing crucial and challenging days as it awaits Hezbollah's response to the assassinations and Israel's reaction.\n\nThe source pointed out that embassy closures and urgent evacuation warnings from Western embassies underline the serious risks, signaling that any major attack on Israel could have severe consequences for Lebanon.\n\nThe source hopes that all parties understand that the ongoing diplomatic efforts are the last chance to avoid a wider war.\n\nAs Lebanon waits for Hezbollah's response to the killing of Shukr and Iran's reaction to the assassination of Haniyeh, the country is facing high tension.\n\nWestern and Arab embassies have urgently advised their citizens to leave Lebanon, and most airlines have suspended flights to Beirut International Airport.", "source": {"uri": "english.aawsat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asharq Al-Awsat English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Revolutionary_Guard_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Damascus"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Damascus"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litani_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Litani River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli settlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Syria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://english.aawsat.com/s3/files/styles/1200x600/public/2024-08/741930_0.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799808", "eventUri": "eng-9799808", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

condemns 'heinous' killing of Haniyeh, violation of Iran's sovereignty", "body": "CAIRO - 8 August 2024: An extraordinary meeting for foreign ministers from member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) has strongly condemned the \"heinous\" assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the former Hamas leader, in an Israeli strike on Iran.\n\nThe open-ended extraordinary gathering of the executive committee at the foreign ministers' level of the OIC convened on Wednesday to discuss the Israeli crimes against the Palestinian people and its Infringing on Iran's sovereignty.\n\nIn a communique following the meeting, the foreign ministers held Israel, the illegal occupying force, entirely accountable for the assault on Haniyeh, which occurred in late July.\n\nThe ministers declared the incident as \"a crime of aggression, a flagrant violation of international law and the UN Charter and a serious infringement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and national security of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\"\n\nThe meeting additionally denounced the continuous Israeli crimes, cautioning that they destabilize security and peace in the region.\n\nThe ministers urged immediate and efficient action by the UN Security Council within its primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security.\n\nFurthermore, the extraordinary session vehemently condemned the persistent war crimes, aggression, and genocide perpetrated by Israel in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nIt was noted that Israeli aggression against Palestinians over the past 300 days resulted in the deaths and injuries of over 140,000 Palestinians, predominantly women and children.\n\nThe OIC gathering also censured the destruction of essential facilities and infrastructure, as well as the displacement of over two million Palestinians from their residences.\n\nThe meeting called for an immediate cessation of Israeli aggression and the practice of torture, starvation, and collective punishment against the Palestinian population.\n\nIt also reaffirmed an unequivocal rejection and vowed to counter through all means any efforts to displace, expel, or forcibly transfer the Palestinian people from their homeland.\n\nHazardous regional situation\n\nIsrael is on alert for potential retaliatory actions from Iran following the Israeli forces' assassination of prominent Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.\n\nLate in July, Israeli forces killed Fuad Shukr, a prominent commander of Iran-backed Hezbollah in Beirut, and Hamas' Haniyeh in a strike in Tehran.\n\nIran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) pledged that Israel would face \"severe punishment at the appropriate time, place, and manner\" for Shukr's killing.\n\nThe IRGC stated that Hezbollah's attacks are anticipated to extend beyond military sites.\n\nIt also mentioned that the strike against Shukr resulted in the deaths of five civilians, with the support of the United States.\n\nSeveral countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and others, have updated their travel advisories for Lebanon, urging their citizens to refrain from all travel to the country due to the deteriorating security situation.\n\nMeanwhile, Haniyeh was assassinated in his residence in the Iranian capital shortly after participating in the inauguration of Pezeshkian.\n\nThe Israeli military has declared a state of high alert in anticipation of an Iranian counterattack on Israel, while the Pentagon has announced the deployment of additional warships and fighter jets to deter any potential assault.\n\nSeveral major airlines, including United, Delta, and Lufthansa, have suspended flights to and from Israel due to concerns about the escalating security situation.\n\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed retaliation after Haniyah's death, characterizing it as a \"duty.\" Reports indicate that Khamenei has ordered a direct strike against Israel.\n\nBoth Hezbollah and Hamas have also pledged to avenge Haniyeh's killing, heightening fears of a potential regional conflict.\n\nThe growing tensions across the region come while the Israeli war in Gaza has continued for 10 months.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes across the strip, even in designated \"safe zones,\" have killed 39,653 individuals and injured 91,535, according to Gaza's health ministry on Tuesday.\n\nAdditionally, Gaza has experienced extensive destruction of vital infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, and essential facilities, heightening the region's susceptibility to an imminent famine.", "source":

Since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel responded with a brutal campaign in Gaza, the region has been on edge. The longer the Gaza war rages, the more likely it is to set off a regional war. Following the assassination in Tehran of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas's political leader, a potentially calamitous cycle of escalation looms as Iran and its allies, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, and militias operating under the banner of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq and Syria, prepare to retaliate.\n\nWhile the outlook is dire, recent history suggests a dangerous escalation cycle between the longtime adversaries can be contained. Nineteen dramatic days in April showed how it can be done. After an Israeli strike on an Iranian consular facility in Damascus killed several senior commanders from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Tehran launched an unprecedented and massive direct strike against Israel.\n\nA degree of forewarning; the fact that Iran's network of nonstate allies largely held their fire; and aerial defenses from Israel, together with the United States and other Western and some Arab countries, limited the damage, and Israel responded with a limited strike inside Iran.", "source": {"uri": "crisisgroup.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crisis Group"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Syria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Revolutionary_Guard_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arab world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damascus"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Damascus"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.crisisgroup.org/sites/default/files/styles/large_16x9_ct/public/2024-04/Foreign_Policy_logo_2014.png?itok=t2GVrXkt", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799808", "eventUri": "eng-9799808", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.615686274509804, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Have we been here before?", "body": "As we wait for a possible attack from Iran or Hezbollah, it is impossible not to reminisce on other times when it seemed like the world was going to end.\n\nI've been experiencing a series of flashbacks lately. It might be my age, or it might be The Situation - the feeling that the world is perilously spinning ever faster. Whether or not age brings wisdom is debatable, but it brings the benefits of experience.\n\nSo, here I am, facing an old-new dilemma. In January 1991, as then-editor of In Jerusalem, The Jerusalem Post's local supplement, the imminent outbreak of the First Gulf War presented me with an unforgettable challenge: The paper went to press just after the January 15 deadline for Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait expired, and I had to take into account that by the time readers picked up a copy on Friday, the country could be at war. And not just any war - a war in which Saddam Hussein might throw nonconventional weapons at us, instead of restricting them to the Kurds and his own people.\n\nI had to decide what the cover story would be - assuming it would be printed and there would still be readers. (For the record, the paper was printed and distributed after a delay of a few hours after the first Scud attacks on Israel.)\n\nUltimately, I had the inspired idea of sending a reporter to interview a psychologist on how to cope with stress. The main tip, \"Don't worry about things that are beyond your control,\" remains with me and has served me well during the many, many subsequent wars and waves of terrorism. Advertisement\n\nAhead of that January 15 deadline, I attended an \"end of the world\" party mainly with other journalists, the cynical breed that we are. This week, I was reminded of that party in the home of Ron Kampeas, today with the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. I'm less blase about the risks of war now - I'm older; I've seen real losses; and I have a combat soldier son in the reserves. But I still think the \"Don't panic\" slogan of both the British comedy series Dad's Army and Douglas Adams's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the only sensible option.\n\nSOME FRIENDS were paralyzed this week by the fear of an Iranian response to the elimination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. It was an achievement requiring immense intelligence and operational skills and has been widely attributed to Israel, especially as it came within 24 hours of Israel eliminating Hezbollah's No. 2, Fuad Shukr, in Beirut.\n\nOther friends are more pragmatic and are doing what Israelis do best: Adapt and carry on. It's not as though Iran or its terrorist proxies Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis need an excuse to attack Israel - or the West.\n\nAt a Shabbat lunch with friends last week, the conversation centered not on local events but on the horrendous wave of antisemitic attacks in places ranging from Melbourne to Toronto, where a Jewish school bus and school building had been set on fire. Violent rallies and chants of \"Intifada, revolution\" are taking place in major Western cities by terrorist supporters wrapped in keffiyehs and waving Palestinian flags.\n\nThe threat is not to Israel but to the West at large. And a police response warning Jews to stay away for their own safety \"is not helpful,\" to borrow a phrase from US President Joe Biden and others after the Haniyeh elimination. Incidentally, following the terrible right-wing race riots in the UK, I'm waiting to see Biden issue sanctions on the individuals involved and for the UN to hold a special session - you know, like what would happen if the thugs had been Israeli Jews. Advertisement\n\nWhen I went shopping this week, I saw no evidence of panic buying. The people on the line complained about the usual things: the prices, the heatwave, and the challenges of keeping young children amused during the summer vacation. Some were concerned about the havoc caused to vacation plans as international airlines gave into fear - terrorism - and canceled flights to Tel Aviv.\n\nWhat struck me was not the worry about the current hostilities but a reminder of ancient times. Next week, the Jewish people mark Tisha B'Av, the 9th of Av, the date when the First and Second Temples were destroyed. It's a day of mourning, fasting, praying, and reading the biblical Book of Lamentations. Among the mourning practices is the abstinence from wearing leather shoes, hence Jerusalem stores this time of year offer sales on plastic footwear. It's a reminder of both the ancient loss and the modern revival of the Jewish homeland.\n\nOn the worst day possible\n\nThere has been much media speculation that Iran will choose to attack the Jewish state on Tisha B'Av, because of the perceived psychological impact, symbolism, and vulnerability. In October 1973, on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, the Arab world launched (yet another) war aimed at annihilating Israel; 50 years later, almost to the day, when Hamas invaded southern Israel - murdering, raping, burning, and abducting - it was on Simchat Torah, a festival of rejoicing.\n\nIn April, Iran launched hundreds of missiles and killer drones on Israel. Thanks in part to an extraordinary alliance that included the US, France, Jordan, and reportedly some Gulf States, the damage was less than the Shi'ite ayatollahs had dreamed of: A young Bedouin girl was severely wounded in her home in the Negev (she was recently released from the hospital) and there was some minor damage to a military base.\n\nThe strike, however, wasn't a complete waste of time for Iran - they learned certain facts about capabilities and possibilities for the future. I'm not complacent. Instead of wagging a finger and warning Tehran about hitting Israel, world leaders should be taking active measures against Iran.\n\nIt is not Israel that is escalating the conflict: Iran sponsors the terrorists who on October 7 perpetrated their mega-atrocity on Israel. Iran supplies the weapons - rockets that are still being launched at Israel. Iran backs the Houthis who attack international shipping.\n\nIsrael cannot stand alone in the fight. It is not Israel's fight alone. When the world powers allow the Islamic Republic of Iran to access billions of dollars that it uses to fund its terrorist proxies and enable it to remain on the threshold of military nuclear capability, calls for restraint make a hollow echoing sound. Threatening Israel with arms sanctions does not deter Tehran.\n\nIn the First Gulf War, then-prime minister Yitzhak Shamir acquiesced to American calls for \"restraint\" - something he later described as being one of the toughest decisions he had to make - and the US provided Israel with Patriot anti-missile systems, the less sophisticated precursor of the jointly developed Iron Dome system. Shamir's restraint earned him passing praise, but it is now clear that it was the decision by Menachem Begin to bomb Iraq's nascent nuclear reactor in 1981 that kept us safer during the war.\n\nFor decades, Israel has been warning of the dangers emanating from Tehran. Too often, it was dismissed as an obsession of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his own purposes. An \"axis of evil\" has developed in the meantime - Iran, Russia, China, and to a lesser extent North Korea. These are the countries that support Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of neighboring Ukraine; China's threats to democratic Taiwan and the South Sea; and Iran's expansion throughout the Middle East.

On the other: dissidents, journalists, and prisoners of conscience,\" Weiss wrote.

Restraint is an admirable trait in a fight in a school playground. It is not a strategy to ensure survival in the global arena.", "source": {"uri": "m.jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post | JPost.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

How dare you?! No power will support us ... We will have to fight on two fronts and maybe three. Even the United States does not support us ... we will have no weapons supply if we run into shortages during the war.\"\n\nThe speaker: The leader of the religious Zionist Party, Moshe Haim Shapira. The reprimanded officer: Chief of Staff, Yitzhak Rabin. The time: The so-called \"waiting period,\" a tense three weeks between the time in which Egyptian forces crossed the Suez Canal and the breakout of the 1967 Six Day War.\n\nIsrael was under pressure; the Chief of Staff was under pressure. Historians have more than one interpretation concerning Rabin's eventual \"collapse\" under pressure. There was Rabin's version, and there was Air Force Chief and future president Ezer Weizman's. The short biography on Rabin written by Prof. Itamar Rabinovich, undoubtedly a very sympathetic writer (he was a close advisor to Rabin in his second term as Prime Minister), beautifully describes the increasing burden on Rabin. Former PM David Ben-Gurion shouts at him; Defense Minister Moshe Dayan makes life difficult for him; Shapira presses him. When politicians are under pressure, they tend to pass it on to those in charge of military affairs.\n\n\"The three meetings took a heavy toll on Rabin,\" Rabinovich wrote. He tends to accept Rabin's version. His wife Leah, believing her husband must get some rest, called a medical officer who sedated Rabin. He slept for the next 24 hours, and then went back to work. The waiting period was tense. In retrospect it turned out that Israel's anxieties were overstated. Within six days it defeated its enemies. Of course, the parallels stop here. No one expects such a rapid victory in a war against Hezbollah, Yemen and Iran, which would be an unwelcome addition to the war with Hamas. As I write these words, a war hasn't started. By the time you read them, who knows what's going to happen.\n\nAs I write these words, a war hasn't started. By the time you read them, who knows what's going to happen.\n\nBack in 1967, Israel had a cautious political leadership and an energetic military leadership. General Ariel Sharon hoped that a war would convince the Egyptians not to fight Israel \"for the next 10 or 20 years\" (as described by historian Tom Segev). Sharon was right in his realization that Israel can bring about \"the total destruction of the Egyptian forces.\" Sharon was wrong in his assessment that a heavy blow, such as the one delivered by Israel in the Six Day War, would indeed deter the Egyptians for 10 or 20 years. It deterred Egypt for no more than two. Which tells us something about the limits of two common clich\u00e9s that we hear a lot these days - that restraint is a positive attribute of policy, and that deterrence is an effective tool of policy.\n\nWould it have been better for Israel if the days of that long waiting period, on the eve of the Six Day War, had been used to prevent the war? Would the situation in the Middle East have been better if the Johnson administration had been more resolute, more determined, in its dealings with the Egyptians and the Syrians? Alternative history is fun, but not quite serious fun. The war would not have broken out, Israel would not have won - with alternative history, all bets are off. Perhaps the future would have progressed in the direction of reconciliation and peace, perhaps the continuation would have been a more difficult war under more difficult conditions a few years later. And here, trying to draw a parallel is possible. It is difficult to say emphatically what would be more beneficial to Israel: A major flare-up that would reshuffle all the cards in the Middle East, or maybe Israel's interest is to have a limited exchange of blows, the result of which would be the preservation of the existing balance of power?\n\nWould it have been better for Israel if the days of that long waiting period, on the eve of the Six Day War, had been used to prevent the war?\n\nThe existing balance of power is unstable. Sticking to it probably means more rounds of violence in the future, perhaps on better terms for Israel, perhaps not.\n\nShortly after the Oct. 7 attack, the Israeli cabinet faced a dilemma. Israel's north was evacuated because of the understandable fear of a massacre of Israelis who live by the Lebanese border. Israel's troops were facing south, as the need to fight Hamas was obvious. Hezbollah - warned and undeterred by President Biden's \"don't!\" speech - assessed that it could act with relative impunity against Israel.\n\nDefense Minister Yoav Gallant smelled an opportunity. Hamas is a small player. Hezbollah is the much larger fish. Maybe Israel ought to turn a calamity into an opportunity and attack in the north rather than the south?\n\nPrime Minister Netanyahu and the cabinet debated and rejected Galant's proposal. The other ministers had three main objections: One - Hamas was the enemy that Israelis wanted to fight, and fighting on two fronts is a challenge. Two - Hamas is the enemy whose defeat seemed more realistic, and Israel wanted a clear show of its ability to eliminate an enemy. Three - fighting Hezbollah could mean a flare-up of a regional war, and the U.S. put immense pressure on Israel to not act in a way that would increase the likelihood of such a war.\n\nAnd so, a status quo emerged: Hezbollah barraged Israel daily, in a fashion reminiscent of the war that came after the Six Days War - the 1969-1970 War of Attrition. With time, Yemenite radicals joined the party and contributed their rockets. And in April, Iran took the most visibly aggressive step against Israel in its history and sent hundreds of flying explosive devices to Israel. Israel's response on all fronts was limited. It aimed to contain the violence and focus on Hamas.\n\nA status quo emerged: Hezbollah barraged Israel daily, in a fashion reminiscent of the war that came after the Six Days War - the 1969-1970 War of Attrition.\n\nWas this decision, to refrain from igniting a broader flareup, a mistake? Again - we can toy with alternative histories, but it all leads to dead ends. The downside of the current situation is clear: Hezbollah and Iran are exactly where they want to be. They can harass Israel without the need to worry about grave consequences. Israel does not want a larger war; they don't want a larger war. But that's just a headline below which a sub-headline is necessary: Israel doesn't want a larger war - and expects hostilities to end. Iran and Hezbollah do not want a larger war - and aim for hostilities to continue. Israel's hands are tied -- by operational limits, by its need to remain focused on Gaza, by its allies. The hands of its enemies are relatively free. They need to make sure of just one thing: To keep their action under a certain unspecified level of violence. Killing twelve boys in the Golan Heights - that's the kind of error they want to avoid, as it forces Israel to respond more vigorously to the attacks, and forces them to respond to the response, and could force Israel to reconsider the status quo of harassment.\n\nThe downside of the current situation is clear: Hezbollah and Iran are exactly where they want to be. They can harass Israel without the need to worry about grave consequences.\n\nWhat does Israel really want? I'm going to take a short detour before we conclude.\n\nThere are two competing historical narratives describing the actions of King Henry VIII (the one known for his six wives). One presents him as a hedonistic and shallow king, manipulated by advisers, \"inept,\" torn between competing factions; the other presents him as cunning, as \"the motivating force behind all important policies.\" Each of them is based on documents and testimonies. Each of them depends, in the end, on the decision of whoever writes the history of Henry VIII's reign in the 16th century.\n\nHistorian Lucy Wooding, whose book on the King I am reading during the 2024 Waiting Period, ruled in favor of the king. That is, she argues that Henry was \"making use of factions, rather than factions making use of the king.\" Wooding believes that presenting Henry as a puppet of his advisors was mainly due to political or propaganda needs. When he did something unpopular, it was convenient to blame someone else. It's not his fault -- it's Anne Boleyn's. It's not his fault -- it's Thomas Cromwell's.\n\nYou can read this biography and reflect on Benjamin Netanyahu's image. After all, there are also two similar narratives about his actions and decisions in recent weeks and months. And if I may guess, these two interpretations will continue to resonate in future histories of Israel. The historian of year 2524 is going to have to weigh them. One contends that Netanyahu is the leader whose wishes are decisive, the one who steers the country in the direction he is aiming for. The other contends that the PM is a puppet, manipulated by his much more radical coalition partners, Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir. They control him, because of their power to maintain or overthrow the coalition.\n\nThe one side contends that Netanyahu is a decisive leader who steers the country in the direction he desires. The other contends the PM is a puppet, manipulated by his much more radical coalition partners, Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir.\n\nDoes Netanyahu want an end to the war, a hostage deal, a cessation of hostilities? Or does he not want a hostage deal, want to escalate the war, believe that the battle must continue? We know what Netanyahu says, we see what he does, we hear what his coalition partners advise or pressure him to do. But with all this evidence the debate could not be resolved. Much like the case of Henry VIII, there's Wooding's argument for Netanyahu as the master of strategic goals, and there's a competing case for Netanyahu as the puppet of political considerations. Netanyahu's heart and mind are a black box. None of those who look at him from the outside know for certain what he is thinking, what considerations really motivate him.\n\nNetanyahu's heart and mind are a black box. None of those who look at him from the outside know for certain what he is thinking, what considerations really motivate him.\n\nNetanyahu's opponents, his many critics, believe that he is motivated by political reasons. He wants to calm down Ben-Gvir. He wants to prolong the war to postpone elections. He wants to take a position that suits the political \"base.\" The opponents believe - and this is the harshest verdict a public can reach concerning a leader - that the PM deliberately and mischievously prolongs the war, not for the strategic reasons he keeps voicing, but for purely political reasons.\n\nOf course, Netanyahu's supporters vehemently disagree with such allegation or conclusion. They see substantive reasons for his actions and decisions. Netanyahu insists on victory, while his opponents are getting ready to cave. Netanyahu resists U.S. pressure to stop short of achieving Israel's objectives, while his opponents are quick to accept unreasonable demand.\n\nIt is difficult for both sides to admit that, indeed, there are two types of reasons for doing what the government does. It is difficult for both sides to admit that indeed, there is no way to know which of the two is the decisive one in Netanyahu's mind. Israelis' position is determined not by the evidence, but rather according to their predetermined position: those who are suspicious of the PM assume that his main objectives are political. Those who are less suspicious of him accept his strategic arguments.\n\nIsrael is kicking the can down the road. The U.S. is kicking it down the road. The world is kicking many cans down the road.\n\nThe \"can\" was Hamas - it was kicked down the road from 2007, when it took over Gaza, to 2024.\n\nThe \"can\" is Hezbollah - it was kicked down the road from the 2006 Lebanon war, to 2024.\n\nThe \"can\" is the Houthis in Yemen, and it is the belligerent, revolutionary, Iran.\n\nKicking a can down the road tends to be used as a negative description of inaction. Instead of deciding, one kicks the can. Oftentimes, the result is calamity, because problems don't just disappear when countries and leaders ignore them. Israel decided that Hamas in power could be contained by a mixture of deterrence and bribe. It decided not to launch a costly preventive war to stop Hamas from becoming more powerful. In retrospect it is easy to see that Israel was wrong to make this calculation. But imagine the opposite policy. Imagine Israel deciding, in 2009 or 2016, to go to war whose aim is to uproot Hamas. Would Israelis support it? Would the international community support it? And just remember, this is the same international community that never took the extra step necessary to prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon. It is the same international community that lets the Houthis terrorize passing cargo ships.\n\nKicking the can has a bad name, but not bad enough to make it disappear as a policy, because it's convenient for leaders and publics, because it's easier to sell, because sometimes it does work. Sometimes buying time is the best option one has. And sometimes - if rarely - challenges are indeed resolved by the mere passage of time. Since no one seems to want a war, and until someone decides to risk a war, the noise you hear, it is just an empty can.", "source": {"uri": "jewishjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shmuel_rosner@jewishjournal.com", "name": "Shmuel Rosner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itamar_Rabinovich", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Itamar Rabinovich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Dayan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moshe Dayan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Sharon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ariel Sharon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Egyptian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alternate history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Six-Day War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief of staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_Rabin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yitzhak Rabin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Status quo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Henry VIII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Segev", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Segev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezer_Weizman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ezer Weizman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Religious Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_Attrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War of Attrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Puppet state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ben-Gurion", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Ben-Gurion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

Israel executed a dual strike against the leaders of the two largest fronts within the so-called \"Unit of Arenas,\" which Iran believes it has imposed upon Tel Aviv. The first target was Fouad Shukr, the Chief of Staff of Hezbollah forces in the southern suburbs of Beirut. Shortly after that, Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of the political bureau of Hamas, was targeted in Tehran. His assassination posed considerable embarrassment and a severe blow to the prestige of the Islamic Republic.\n\nThe assassination of Haniyeh while he was visiting Tehran to attend the inauguration of the new Iranian president constitutes a severe violation of Iran's sovereignty and undermines any claims regarding the republic's ability to safeguard its internal security. Furthermore, the newly elected president, Masoud Beizikian, affiliated with the reformist movement, now finds himself in an extremely challenging position. He had prioritized improving relations with the West and Washington, but this assassination will likely compel him to revise those priorities. This aligns with Israel's interests, as they believe that enhancing relations will inevitably lead to the lifting of sanctions and the acceleration of Iran's nuclear programme.\n\nThe two strikes revealed Israel's ability to target whoever it wants, confirming that it is the only party that can violate the agreed-upon rules of engagement. Other parties must deal with the consequences of this violation without exceeding those rules. This is not the first breach of Iranian security and likely won't be the last. There have been a series of assassinations of Iranian scientists, the theft of Iranian nuclear archives displayed by Benjamin Netanyahu, and a scandal involving Mossad elements kidnapping Iranian intelligence leaders in Tehran, interrogating them, filming them, and sharing them on social media.\n\nBefore the recent assassinations, the war in Gaza was approaching its first year with no hope of containment. Now, the situation has become even more complex and obscure. The justifications for expanding the war have outnumbered the reasons for halting it, putting the entire region at risk of sliding into a regional conflict.\n\nIran is determined to push forward its agenda in the region through the \"Axis of Resistance,\" managed by its militias in Lebanon, Yemen, and Iraq, along with full coordination with Islamic resistance elements in Gaza. Tehran deliberately showcases this coordination politically and in the media, as evident in the recent speech by Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, which sometimes resonated with the speech of Ansar Allah leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi. This makes it difficult to ignore the link between the Israeli army's bombing of Hodeidah and its simultaneous bombing of Hezbollah arms depots in southern Lebanon.\n\nBut do these fronts have a real impact on the course of events in the region? This question requires a thorough chronological review. The Middle East has witnessed unprecedented regional and international wars and conflicts since the end of World War II, starting with the Suez War in 1956, the Arab-Israeli wars, the war in Lebanon, and the conflict in Yemen, which coincided with the Iran-Iraq war. This was followed by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the American invasion of Iraq, paving the way for what is called fourth and fifth-generation wars, including the Arab Spring revolutions in Libya and Syria, and recently, the conflict in Sudan.\n\nThis indicates that the situation before the term \"unit of squares\" was not optimistic; rather, it can be asserted that the magnitude of conflicts and regional divisions has given rise to such terminology to address the current circumstances per the interests and agendas of the state. The aforementioned does not justify the acceptance of the Iranian agenda, which is not innocent and has further obscured the regional landscape. However, the reality is more complex than it appears, and those who reduce it to the events of October 7th are not being fair to the nature of the situation and are overlooking the true causes of this intricate crisis.\n\nHowever, if we leave aside what has been mentioned before, the Iranian arms will not remain dependent on what Tehran dictates to them along the line, and soon the emerging interests of some of those arms may intersect with the interests of the main funder and may even collide. This is one of the hellish equations of war in the region that cannot be read outside its strong connection to the past conflicts of the region and its future, and soon outside the Palestinian and Israeli transformations and at the level of the American political scene, especially after President Joe Biden's decision not to run for a second term and its impact on the future of the Middle East.\n\nAfter nine months of the bloodiest war in the Gaza Strip, the emerging results indicate that Hamas' conflict with Israel did not cancel its conflict with the Palestinian Authority. Historically and in principle, both parties can be held responsible for this conflict. At present, Hamas bears the responsibility for the continuation of Palestinian division, as it is the main Palestinian party engaged in the conflict in Gaza. While Israel is responsible for the stream of Palestinian bloodshed, Hamas' political and moral responsibility towards the Palestinian cause requires finding political solutions to end the war. Its goal in negotiations should be the political survival of Palestinians, not just its survival, in addition to preserving their lives. However, its political and moral accountability is linked to the cost of its survival in the \"day after\" the war, as its continuation represents not only a defeat for Israel but also for the Palestinian Authority. This does not imply that Hamas is solely responsible for hindering negotiations or that Israel is adamant about stopping the ceasefire. The issue is not as straightforward as that, but rather that Hamas should be more concerned than anyone else, whether Israel or any regional power involved in the conflict, with stopping the war if necessary. Even if it requires greater concessions, it is not in front of Israel, but in front of the Palestinians, by opening the way to cancel the Palestinian division and unify the Palestinian political vision in a way that enables Palestinians to support their cause regionally and internationally. This is a central point in all conflicts in the Middle East, as its solution is primarily based on a political decision rather than a military one.", "source": {"uri": "dailynewsegypt.com",

The key word is NUCLEAR and the Jews are hiding in Jerusalem like the Germans did their bunkers by hospitals in World War II, in order to use Jerusalem as the Human Shield as they believe Islam will not strike their 3rd holiest site at Jerusalem.\n\nThe key word in this is NUCLEAR. That is repeated as that device which was in Cyprus a few times is not one which was continued to be tracked as a 9 11 event trigger response of carte blanche.\n\nFor the first time in decades, the Shin Bet has opened the underground \"nuclear\" shelter in Jerusalem known as the \"Doomsday Bunker\" which will house the country's top political leadership and officials of the Defense and Security complex, a sign that Israel is preparing for war large scale with unknown ramifications.\n\n\"The Shin Bet has completed preparations for the operation of the underground command and control shelter in Jerusalem, intended to house the state's political-security elite during a major war.\n\nThe shelter is equipped with all means of command and control, it is connected to \"The Pit\", the headquarters of the Ministry of Defense in Tel Aviv, and all other shelters, senior leaders can stay for a long time during a war and it is invulnerable,\" reports the Israeli news website Walla.\n\nBiden Harris and Shapiro are blinking in not wanting to get involved in this war with Iran, but Iran is gearing up with full Russian response being flown into Iran. Iran comprehends that it will die if it continues to wait, and now is the best venture for the deployment of their nuclear weapons.\n\nThis will be large scale missile strikes, but the Iranians are learning. Soft targets are now a priority. I highlight in red about this expanded war front.\n\nSenior Israeli officials are preparing for a multi-day offensive by Iran, Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups in response to the killing of Hamas's top political figure, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran on Wednesday.\n\nOfficials believe the attacks will include hundreds of missiles, rockets and drones, attempting to overwhelm Israel's air defenses over a period of at least three days .\n\nUS and Israeli officials said both Iran and Hezbollah are still working to finalize their military plans and get them approved at the political level.\n\nAn Iranian source told Al-Jazeera that the retaliation will be severe and painful. Iran can target Israeli citizens or senior officials abroad in addition to launching missiles at home.\n\nThe WSJ notes that Iran has told Arab diplomats it doesn't care if the response sparks a war with Israel , according to people familiar with the talks.\n\nIran like all enemies of the state of Tel Aviv, needs to cut off and kill the extension of Mosaad which placed a bomb in their VIP quarters that murdered the Hamas leader. That means the Mosaad and their agents across the world in finance, industry, government and think tanks who all rock the cradle of the world's political centers. If Iran would focus on eliminating that syndicate of influence, this would end the projections of power against Iran and Iran would only need face the Jewish nuclear arsenal which it could respond.\n\nThere is in the Iranian statement the Mosaad 9 11 cover needed to attack Jew York City by their proxies and have Iran blamed for this to force political America on the Obama Harris Shapiro Tel Aviv ticket to hit Iran, and then we have a real Russian response which Russia has ordered plans to move it's industrial centers to Siberia in phase 1 plans submitted by October 1st.\n\nAt this point the Kamala World War GOPliters are hoping for profits and hegemony in nuclear war. Donald Trump in his Don Coin are going to use economic might to break BRICS which is a great deal less radioactive than the Kamala nuclear war which is being generated out of Tel Aviv.\n\nJust remember the Jews were digging nuclear tunnels in New York City, only one was found.

This war has been waged on a one-sided basis: the new part is that Israel is hitting back.\n\nWhen asked whether he felt the Iranian regime should be toppled or if that could lead to worse problems for the region, Bennett said he believed the regime should be destroyed.\n\n'The epicenter of terror'\n\n\"Iran's regime, the Iranian Islamic Republic of Iran, is the epicenter of terror. It's the source of about 80% of the terror in the Middle East and beyond, and it's destined to fall.\"\n\nHe compared the regime to the Soviet Union's regime and influence in the 1980s, calling both \"corrupt, old, unconnected regimes, incompetent, despised by their people.\"\n\n\"This regime will fall, and the Iranian people will be free again; the question is how soon? Will it be in two years, five years, or 30 years?\" Bennett added. The West, he continued, has an important role to play in this downfall, especially through economic action (such as embargoes and sanctions), which he said can \"accelerate the demise\" of the regime and consequently pave the way for a better future for the Middle East.\n\nBennett also spoke more on the killings of top commanders of Iranian proxies - Ismail Haniyeh from Hamas, and Fuad Shakr from Hezbollah - saying that these actions could not be seen as the \"cause\" of the issues but rather the \"result.\"\n\n\"We are fighting back on a war that they started,\" he explained. He criticized Piers Morgan's phrasing at the beginning of the discussion, saying Morgan made the situation appear \"symmetric\" which Bennett said it was not.\n\n\"We have no issue whatsoever with any of our neighbors,\" Bennett said. \"We don't want to dispose of them; we don't want to annihilate them.\"\n\n\"But Iran wants to annihilate Israel. Hamas wants to annihilate Israel. Hezbollah wants to annihilate Israel. So what we're doing is a defensive war against Iran, against its proxies, in order to defend ourselves.\"\n\nHe compared Israel to the \"wave breaker in the middle of a big wave of radical Jihadi terror that in a sense is defending the West from this wave.\"\n\nBennett reiterated the stance of many Israeli officials that the country has no choice but to fight back: \"when someone says we want to annihilate you, shoots rockets and arms from about seven different proxies to kill you, you got to fight until you win and that's what we're going to do.\"\n\nPost-war Gaza\n\nPiers Morgan questioned Israel's ethos of total victory, asking Bennett what that meant and whether the concept translated into an actionable future for post-war Gaza.\n\nBennett said that, for him, victory meant \"Hamas surrendering, raising a white flag, releasing the [hostages] and Israel taking all the Hamas leaders and fighters, putting them on a ship and shipping them away from Gaza, and then we can begin rebuilding a new Gaza.\"\n\nHe added that he was \"unhappy\" with the pace at which Israel's war against Hamas is being fought, calling it \"very low intensity.\"\n\n\"I would call it 5 to 10% intensity - that's not how you win wars, you have got to fight all in.\" Bennett continued by criticizing the speed of fighting, saying it was not happening quickly enough, but acknowledged that the \"tremendous\" international pressure on Israel might be a factor in the \"slowing down.\"\n\nSpeaking on the death toll of the war, which Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry numbered at 39,699 on Thursday, Bennett said that the \"actual numbers [of those killed] are factually very low compared to other urban warfare.\"\n\n\"I don't believe the Hamas reports,\" he continued, \"but let's even assume that they're anything near reality, we're at about a 1:1 ratio of combatants to civilians, which is incredibly low in urban warfare.\"\n\nHe made the comparison of Israel's war against Hamas to the Allies' war against Nazi Germany and Japan in the second world war, saying that, just like how the West \"knew that they had to defeat Japan, and Germany at whatever price,\" Israel must defeat Hamas at any price.\"\n\n\"We're fighting a war against total evil that wants to annihilate us and wants to annihilate your way of living, the free world.\"\n\n\"I can tell you that we are resolute,\" he stated. \"We're not going to sit with a stopwatch and say, you know, it's been 10 months now we stopped, and we let a genocidal regime continue trying to kill Israel.\"\n\nPiers Morgan ended by asking Bennett what Israel planned for Gaza's governance in the absence of a Hamas leadership. Bennett said the post-war plan would involve Israel \"retaining security and defense responsibility for the foreseeable future, so Hamas cannot arise again\" but emphasized that Israel had no desire to govern Gazan civilians.\n\n\"We're in the process of identifying competent local leadership that'll take care of governing Gaza. We will bring in highly qualified people from the Gulf, Saudis, UAE, whoever wants to fix it and primarily Egyptian involvement, and we'll begin rebuilding a new Gaza clean of terror.\"\n\nHowever, he concluded that this \"bright future\" would only be possible once Israel defeated Hamas.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The ongoing conflict in Gaza, coupled with the recent assassinations of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, attributed to Israel, has fueled expectations of Iranian retaliation. As Vox noted, \"uncertainty over how Iran will respond has raised the possibility of wider conflict in the region.\"\n\n\"It's unclear if Iran had anything to do with the attack on al-Asad, and no group has claimed responsibility as of yet. There are Iran-allied groups operating in Iraq, such as the prominent Iraqi militia Kataib Hezbollah. But even if one of these groups is behind the strike, that doesn't necessarily mean it was on Iran's orders; Iran's allies in Iraq sometimes act without explicit instruction.\" Vox said.\n\nThe analysis suggested that the attack on Ain al-Asad could be interpreted as part of a broader tit-for-tat dynamic, especially in light of the recent US operations targeting Iranian-backed militias. As Vox explained, \"Monday's attack can be seen as a tit-for-tat response for the US attack last week on the Popular Mobilization Forces, which killed four.\"\n\nThe implications of this incident are significant, highlighting the delicate balance of power and the potential for a larger conflict. Colin Clarke, a senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, told Vox, \"I think that's the challenge for the Iranians is trying to thread that needle where they respond in a way that doesn't prove to be completely impotent and reveal them as weak, but they also don't want to go overboard.\"\n\nAli Vaez, director of the Iran program at the International Crisis Group, added, \"Without inflicting pain, there is no gain deterrence-wise, and Israel is not a country that just absorbs pain and does not respond -- even with US arm twisting.\"\n\nThe broader context of this attack involves a series of strategic calculations by regional powers. Iran's potential response, which could include leveraging its regional allies to overwhelm Israel's Iron Dome defense system, poses a significant risk of escalating violence. Vaez suggested that the message behind the airbase attack could be that \"if [the US] fails to hold Israel back after Iran retaliates for Haniyeh's killing in Tehran, the US would also be caught in a crossfire this time around.\"\n\nUltimately, how Iran and its allies choose to respond to the recent assassinations will play a crucial role in determining the trajectory of the conflict. As Clarke warned, \"If they escalate too much, the Israelis are really going to continue, especially Netanyahu, to pressure the United States to become more involved, which is not a good scenario for the Iranians.\"\n\n\"Under that scenario, strikes and counterstrikes would likely continue -- and the death toll would rise, in Iran, among its allied groups, and perhaps in Israel as well,\" Vox concluded.", "source": {"uri": "shafaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0631\u062c\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0634\u0641\u0642 \u0646\u064a\u0648\u0632: \u0645\u062c\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0639 \u0645\u062f\u0639\u0648\u0645\u0629 \u0625\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0627\u064b \u062a\u0634\u0643\u0644 \u062e\u0637\u0631\u0627\u064b \u0639\u0644\u0649 4 \u0648\u062a\u0631\u062f\u0639 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u064b \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vox (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Mobilization_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Popular Mobilization Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata'ib_Hezbollah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kata'ib Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Regional power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Crisis_Group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Crisis Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iron Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://media.shafaq.com/media/arcella/1723028411799.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799808", "eventUri": "eng-9799808", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.388235294117647, "wgt": 104, "relevance": 1}

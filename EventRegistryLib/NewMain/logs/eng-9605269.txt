KYNT reported the shooting was in the 1000 block of Main Street.\n\nOstrem was booked at the Minnehaha County Jail with no bond on Tuesday morning, according to the Minnehaha County Jail records. The Attorney General's office, however, released a statement that Ostrem is being held on a $1 million cash only bond.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the Turner County Sheriff's Office, who is managing of Ostrem's charges, and did not hear back immediately for comment.\n\nSouth Dakota's Division of Criminal Investigation is leading the massive investigation. Other agencies involved are the Centerville Police Department, South Dakota Highway Patrol, South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks, Beresford Police Department, Viborg Police Department, Lincoln County Sheriff's Department, and Turner County Sheriff's Department.\n\nThe names of the three victims have not been released at this time.\n\nOstrem previously served as a city councilor and was the mayor in Centerville in 2010.\n\nOstrem, who is originally from Wyoming, was also a Turner County Sheriff's Office investigator in 2007, according to previous local media reporting. He played a role in helping Centerville overcome state-level scrutiny when the city's police chief faced an investigation for a crime in 2006.\n\nOstrem was the center of a two-year legal batter for Centerville between 2010 and 2012, when the city's former police chief filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against him.\n\nThe lawsuit was settled, but former chief Rachel Kopman alleged she was \"repeatedly inundated with sexually inappropriate comments and remarks from Ostrem.\"\n\nCenterville is the home to less than 1,000 people, according to the 2020 Census.

(KELO) -- A 64-year-old Centerville man is facing charges for three counts of first degree murder, according to court documents filed Tuesday.\n\nAccording to a filed complaint, former Centerville mayor and city councilor Jay Edward Ostrem killed three victims on Monday, May 27, 2024 \"with a premeditated design.\" According to lawsuits filed against him, Ostrem previously served as a city councilor and as mayor in Centerville in 2010.\n\nOstrem was booked into the Minnehaha County Jail on a $1 million cash only bond.\n\nAccording to the South Dakota Attorney General's Office, the incident happened around 10 p.m. Monday at a residence in Centerville.\n\nCourt papers say that at 9:44 p.m. Monday, a man described as \"frantic\" called 911 and reported a shooting, telling the operator that his family member had been shot and killed with a shotgun.\n\nThe caller told 911 the shooter was a man from across the street, and he had gone back to his house. While on the phone with 911, the caller told the dispatcher he had also been shot, and shortly thereafter stopped communicating with the dispatcher.\n\nWhen law enforcement arrived on scene, they saw Ostrem leave his house. Despite being told to stop, he continued walking west along Main Street. According to the affidavit, a Game, Fish and Parks officer who responded made contact with Ostrem down the street and demanded he get on the ground.\n\nOstrem obeyed this command and told the officer he had a gun in his pocket.\n\nAs officers approached Ostrem, they saw what they described as an AR-style rifle on the ground near him. They noted that Ostrem was bleeding from his left hand and that he smelled of alcohol.\n\nIn Ostrem's pocket, officers found a .380 handgun, as well as spent shotgun shell casings and at least one spent rifle casing.\n\nEntering the residence from which the 911 call had been made, law enforcement found three people dead from apparent gunshot wounds. Law enforcement next went to Ostrem's house where they made contact with an adult family member of Ostrem.\n\nDCI agents interviewed the family member who told them that on Thursday, May 23, 2024 a neighbor had been at their house while Ostrem was sleeping.\n\nThe family member stated that she and the neighbor had been drinking when he sexually assaulted her; forcibly kissing her, exposing himself to her, and pressing himself against her.\n\nAccording to the family member, she told Ostrem about the assault on Monday when they were both at home. She told DCI that after hearing about the assault, Ostrem \"got up and went raging out of the house.\"\n\nThe family member told DCI agents that Ostrem had not said anything to her as he left, that she did not know where he was going, and that she did not see him again before law enforcement arrived. She told them that Ostrem was former law enforcement and that he had weapons in the home and possibly in his vehicle.\n\nSouth Dakota's Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI) is investigating with assistance from other agencies.\n\nThis is a developing story.

inability to be as successful as men, the suit said.\n\nThe former chief did not receive any disciplinary action or reports against her until she alleged discrimination to the state's Division of Human Rights in October 2009, according to the lawsuit.\n\nCenterville is about 250 miles southeast of Pierre, the state capital and has a population of fewer than 1,000 people, according to the U.S.

Each count carries a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole.\n\n\"There is no further threat to the public,\" Jackley wrote in the press release.\n\nOstrem served as a Turner County sheriff's deputy through the early 2000s after a two-decade career in law enforcement in Wyoming. He was among the deputies involved in investigating the death of Dep. Chad Mechels, who was shot and killed by Ethan Johns in March of 2009. Johns is serving a life sentence for that crime.\n\nIn 2010, while serving as mayor of Centerville, Ostrem was sued for sexual harassment in federal court by former Police Chief Rachel Kopman, who claimed she'd been subjected to unwelcome sexual comments for more than a year before her dismissal as chief. The suit was settled in 2012.\n\nOstrem's law enforcement certification expired in 2016, Jackley spokesman Tony Mangan told South Dakota Searchlight.\n\nA complaint filed against Ostrem on Tuesday in Turner County names the three victims. South Dakota Searchlight is withholding their names, because the Attorney General's office says next of kin have yet to be notified. One of the men was the alleged perpetrator of the sexual assault. Another was a relative of that man, who called police to report the shooting before being shot himself.\n\nAccording to a probable cause affidavit filed Tuesday in Turner County, Ostrem's wife told police that the fatal events of Tuesday evening came after her disclosure to him that one of the victims had sexually assaulted her by rubbing his erect penis against her at the couple's Centerville home Thursday evening, as Ostrem slept.\n\nThe man lived across the street from Ostrem.\n\nUpon learning of the incident, the affidavit said, Ostrem \"got up and went raging out of the house.\" His wife stayed inside until police arrived, which happened shortly after Ostrem was found walking near his home with an \"AR-style rifle\" and a .380 pistol.\n\nA South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks conservation officer was the first to encounter Ostrem after the shooting, the affidavit said, and the officer noted \"an odor of consumed alcohol\" from Ostrem. The one-time deputy complied with the officer's commands to stop walking, and he told the officer he had a pistol in his pocket.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_County,_South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turner County, South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Turner County, South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centerville,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Centerville, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Centerville, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Johns", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethan Johns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marty_Jackley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marty Jackley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnehaha_County,_South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnehaha County, South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnehaha County, South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Electoral_College_vote_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2021 United States Electoral College vote count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Mangan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tony Mangan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wyoming"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wyoming"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pistol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Probable cause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Sexuality", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/south_dakota_searchlight_articles_601/9fa446c54bd4871edb8bf39e06e03c04", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605269", "eventUri": "eng-9605269", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Authorities did not list a motive for the crime, but local news outlets, including South Dakota Searchlight, reported that a probable cause affidavit said Ostrem justified the shooting by claiming it was in retaliation to a sexual assault on his wife.\n\nThat document reportedly added that Zach Frankus called 911 to report that his brother had been gunned down by \"a guy from across the street,\" and that the gunman had returned home. Police said Frankus remained on the phone with a dispatcher when a gunshot rang out and Frankus yelled that he was shot. After that, police said Frankus went silent.\n\n\"After some time on the phone with the dispatcher, the male calling party then reported he had been shot,\" the affidavit said, reported Sioux Falls Live. \"Shortly after he reported he had been shot, the male stopped communicating with the dispatcher.\"\n\nThe outlet reported that the first officer to arrive on the scene was a game warden with the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish, and Parks. That officer said he witnessed Ostrem leave the shooting scene. A second officer arrived shortly after, having traveled 12 miles from nearby Beresford, and helped take Ostrem into custody after he initially refused commands. Those officers reported that Ostrem's breath smelled of alcohol and that blood was on his left hand, reported Sioux Falls Live.\n\nPolice reportedly added that Ostrem possessed three guns at the scene, including a handgun, a shotgun, and an \"AR style rifle.\" Spent shotgun shells were also found on the ground.\n\nThe affidavit identified the victims as Paul Frankus, 26, Zach Frankus, 21, and Timothy Richmond, 35. It's unclear what Richmond's relationship to the Frankus brothers was, if any, but each reportedly died inside the same home on Centerville's main street.\n\nThe Argus Leader reported that Ostrem's wife told police that Paul Frankus had been drinking with her on Thursday when he allegedly exposed his genitals to her and tried to kiss her.\n\nIt was that alleged assault that appears to have set Ostrem off, the Leader reported. Citing his wife, the affidavit claims he was seen \"raging out of the house\" just moments after learning of the alleged incident on Monday and the three men were fatally shot shortly after.\n\nPhotos from the scene showed that Ostrem's front yard had a grill, lawn chair, American flag, and British flag. A profile on X in Ostrem's name showed he regularly re-shared conservative memes, pro-gun posts, and was an avid supporter of Donald Trump.\n\n\"BS in Political Science, Veteran, Retired LEO, happily married to my British Lass,\" his bio reads. \"#MAGA #NRA #BREXIT An actual real person.\"\n\nReports said Ostrem worked in law enforcement for more than two decades in Wyoming and South Dakota, and that he was mayor of Centerville approximately 15 years ago.\n\nIn that role, Searchlight reported that he was sued for sexual harassment in federal court by the town's former police chief, who claimed she'd been subjected to unwelcome sexual comments for more than a year before she was fired from the gig. That lawsuit was settled in 2012.\n\nIf convicted on the murder counts, Sioux Falls Live reports that state law would make Ostrem eligible to be sentenced to death.", "source": {"uri":

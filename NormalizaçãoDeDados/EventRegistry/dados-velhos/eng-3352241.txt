This has brought another period of uncertainty for the Valley, with mainstream politicians warning of serious consequences from any tinkering with the article.\n\nAnd with Attorney General KK Venugopal asserting that the Union government wanted a \"larger debate\" on the issue, many mainstream politicians have criticised the Centre for not filing an affidavit in the case.\n\nWhile the controversy over the issue flares up, Engineer Rashid, the firebrand MLA from north Kashmir's Langate constituency in Kupwara, has offered to quit the post of MLA and join the separatist leadership to \"fight for the right of people of the Valley.\"\n\nFile image of Engineer Rashid. Getty Images\n\nThis offer comes in response to the Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani's statement wherein he had asked mainstream political leaders to join the Hurriyat to help resolve the Kashmir issue. \"In response to Geelani Sahab's appeal to mainstream political parties, to join the Hurriyat, we are ready to give it a thought. I am ready to join the joint Hurriyat leadership,\" he said in a statement.\n\nBut Rashid's offer comes with the condition that the Hurriyat should have a plan to fight for Article 35A. And therein lies the problem. In the past few agitations, the Hurriyat-led separatist leadership hasn't shown any imagination for protests apart from the frequent call for shutdowns.\n\nBack in Rashid's constituency, many seem to support their MLA's move by saying that development of the area is less important when it comes to the Kashmir issue.\n\nMir Waheed, a journalist from the Langate area told Firstpost, \"He has not clearly mentioned of joining Hurriyat, but had said that if they have a better road map to go for resolving the Kashmir issue, he will think of joining. It's least important to think of development in his own constituency, rather than the Kashmir issue\".\n\n\"We have voted for Rashid Sahab not for development issues. He knows very well how to go about Kashmir related issues,\" Showkat Pandith, a businessman from Langate told Firstpost. Another resident, Reyaz Ahmad, echoed these views saying that Rashid is well aware of the situation. \"If we talk about development, he has done his part in last five years,\" he added.\n\nMaking his point clear, Rashid said that he \"will not be ashamed of working as a servant of Geelani, Mehbooba Mufti or Omer Abdullah for the betterment of Kashmir, but only if they have the potential to lessen the trouble of Kashmiris\".\n\nHowever, many believe that Rashid has made his point at a time when Hurriyat has nothing to fight the abrogation of Article 35A.\n\n\"I don't think Rashid is going to join Hurriyat because he has said that (he will join only) if Hurriyat has a clear road map, which everybody knows they don't have. The Hurriyat constitution might not allow him to be a member of both the posts and, moreover, Rashid stands for plebiscite which Hurriyat has almost abandoned. So, I believe it is Rashid's well-engineered political stint,\" Javid Wani, a political analyst told Firstpost.\n\nThere are various factors which might hinder Rashid's ways to join the Hurriyat. Some believe that north Kashmir, especially Langate, will lose its roaring voice from the state Assembly.\n\n\"Rashid cannot change the Hurriyat paradigm, which it holds since inception... both have a contrary vision. His joining may not produce the aspired results,\" Wani said.\n\nGiving a different assessment, Noor Ahmad Baba, a political science professor said: \"He is a very resourceful person and has the capacity to protest. He had been raising issues related to Kashmir from the very beginning. I believe that if he joins Hurriyat, at this point in time when they are under pressure, it will be a boost for the Hurriyat.\"\n\nRashid's offer of joining Hurriyat comes at a time when the latter is steadily losing ground in the Valley. While Rashid won't be a major steal for the Hurriyat, it will certainly indicate the shrinking space for mainstream politics in the current turbulent scenario of Kashmir.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 11, 2017 06:42 pm | Updated Date: Aug 11, 2017 06:44 pm\n\nTags :#Article 35a#Connectthedots#Engineer rashid#Hurriyat#India#Kashmir#Kashmiri separatists#Syed ali shah geelani", "timeCrawl": "13:26:00", "sim": 0.8156862854957581, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-11", "textStart": 4269, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 4281}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8624023", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "id": 276, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Liberalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Liberalism", "id": 492, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "id": 773, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/News_and_Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/News and Media", "id": 788, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Stamps", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Stamps", "id": 1022, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Political_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Political Science", "id": 1216, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

The two time MLA was working as an engineer in Jammu and Kashmir Project Construction Corporation (JKPCC) and was accused of being the spokesman of the militant outfit, Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), before he joined mainstream politics and contested the elections in 2008.\n\nEngineer Rashid. Getty Images\n\nThe plunge of former militants or even their sympathisers into mainstream politics was not against the trend. Congress MLA from Bandipora, Usman Majeed, was a militant before he turned to fight against them and became a legislator. In the current PDP-BJP dispensation, Social Welfare Minister Sajad Gani Lone is a politician whose father, Abdul Gani Lone, was considered to be the founder of Hurriyat. Lone gave up separatist politics and went to the extreme of supporting BJP and was one of the first few politicians from Kashmir to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, before the former chief minister, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, clinched a power sharing deal with the BJP.\n\nHowever, Rashid's joining of mainstream politics and now offering to work with either of the factions of Hurriyat headed by Mirwaiz Umer Farooq and Syed Ali Shah Geelani is a development that is dramatic. Although earlier former chief minister and National Conference president Farooq Abdullah praised the Hurriyat ahead of the Srinagar parliamentary elections in April, the offer to join the separatists by any mainstream politician in Kashmir is a first of its kind. Rashid was in 2006 accused of being the spokesman of JeM and he fought the case at a Srinagar court and was acquitted of the charges in 2012. Two years later in 2008 he resigned from the JKPCC to contest as an independent candidate from Langate assembly seat and got elected as an MLA. He won the 2014 election as well from the seat.\n\nBut as an MLA, Rashid talked about giving the people the right of joining Pakistan through the vote of self-determination, which forced the BJP members to seek his expulsion as a legislator. He also faced suspension as an MLA and has been critical of both the NC and PDP targeting them for the \"sufferings of people of Kashmir.\" Rashid was attacked by the BJP MLAs earlier in the Legislative Assembly after he organised a beef party at the Srinagar MLA hostel. The issue had snowballed into a major controversy and senior BJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh, had to apologise on behalf of his MLAs for the attack on Rashid as Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and NC working president Omar Abdullah condemned the action.\n\nBefore Rashid announced his plans to join Hurriyat, his party members including the Awami Itehad Party (AIP) spokesman Inam-ul-Nabi were in touch with the separatists in Kashmir. Inam went to meet Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz on Thursday to discuss the possibility of Rashid joining the separatist outfit, but he said \"the authorities didn't allow me to meet Mirwaiz.\"\n\nOffering to join Hurriyat for the larger Kashmir cause of right to self-determination, Rashid in a statement said, \"It is not the time to blame each other but work for resolution of Kashmir dispute and stop New Delhi from its utterances and efforts. It is indulging in changing the dispute nature of J&K.\"\n\nThe Langate MLA said that he was responding to the offer of Hurrriyat that mainstream politicians should join the separatists.\n\nRashid told Firstpost that he was forced to fight elections after the excesses committed by the government forces on him. He also said that he was seeking appointment with Geelani, Mirwaiz and Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front chairman Yaseen Malik and other pro-freedom leaders to discuss joining the separatists.\n\nA poster child of controversies Rashid would often praise Geelani and Mirwaiz in the Assembly, when others accused him of reneging on his oath to abide by the Indian Constitution. Rashid even said that Geelani and Mirwaiz were the true representatives of Kashmiri people while lashing out at Omar Abdullah asking him to desist from carrying out attacks on Geelani.\n\nOmar had questioned the locus standi of Geelani to give a call for protection of Article 35A when he had not been recognising the Indian constitution. Before Rashid made his offer public, he had supported the 12 August call of the Hurriyat Conference against any move to scrap Article 35A that bars the people from outside in owning the properties in Kashmir.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 10, 2017 10:11 pm | Updated Date: Aug 10, 2017 10:11 pm\n\nTags :#Abdul gani lone#Awami itehad party#Congress#Engineer rashid#Farooq abdullah#Hurriyat conference#Inam-ul-nabi#Jaish-e-mohammad#Mirwaiz umer farooq#Mufti mohammad sayeed#Mufti sayeed#Narendra modi#National conference#Nirmal singh#Omar abdullah#Pakistan#Pdp#Politicsdecoder#Sajad gani lone#Syed ali shah geelani#Usman majeed#Yaseen malik", "timeCrawl": "17:11:00", "sim": 0.7411764860153198, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 4389, "date": "2017-08-12", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 4398}, {"date": "2017-08-10", "textStart": 4557, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 4569}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8451021", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "id": 276, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "id": 773, "wgt": 100}], "details": {"gpCnt": 4}}

Sources quoting NIA investigators say close to 80 properties, including apple orchards, bungalows, apartments and commercial establishments in the Valley and Delhi are being looked at minutely. The real estate under investigation, officials say, is collectively worth several hundred crores. Over two dozen residential premises, agricultural and horticultural holdings and a school on seven acres of land in Sopore are linked to Geelani's family, believes the NIA. The list includes assets owned by or 'held for' Geelani, sons Nayeem and Naseem and son-in-law Altaf Fantoosh.\n\nThe revelations have largely emerged from the interrogation of the seven arrested Hurriyat functionaries, and hawala operators and Hurriyat associates in Delhi and Jammu. This includes Devinder Singh Behal, a lawyer arrested on July 30. Sources say the NIA is set to have some of the hawala operators and financiers turn approvers.\n\nWhile both the Geelani family and the Mirwaiz have refuted the NIA's assertions as \"propaganda\", there are clear indications in the Valley that the separatists are being isolated. Since the raids in June, there have been hardly any visitors to Geelani's Srinagar home. The police have detained his man Friday, Muhammad Ashraf Khan, while his secretary Peer Saifullah and media manager Altaf Shah have been arrested. \"No one comes here any more,\" a police guard posted outside tells reporters.

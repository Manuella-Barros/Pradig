Television is in early development on a 300 prequel series, with Zack Snyder in talks to direct & executive produce.\n\nThough exact details in terms of plot, writer, or where it would call home, Variety is reporting exclusively that Warner Bros. Television is in early development on a prequel series to Zack Snyder's Gerard Butler & Lena Headey- starring 2006 film 300. While a number of deals are still in play and not official, reports are that Zack Snyder is in talks to direct and serve as an executive producer on the series. But the potential connections to the original film might not end there. In addition, Deborah Snyder is reportedly in talks to executive produce under her and Zack's Stone Quarry production banner - with Stone Quarry's Wesley Collier, as well as Gianni Nunnari, Mark Canton, and Bernie Goldmann, expected to come aboard the project. The news comes as more and more studios look to mine their past successes for potential reboots, restarts, revamps, prequels, spinoffs, and more - with Paramount+ with Showtime's Dexter: Original Sin being a recent example from just this week alone.\n\nZack Snyder's original film was based on Frank Miller and Lynn Varley's graphic novel of the same name and also starred Rodrigo Santoro, David Wenham, Dominic West, Vincent Regan, Tom Wisdom, and Michael Fassbender. With a reported budget of $65 million and a global box office gross of over $450 million, it's no surprise that 300 would be a potential franchise opportunity. In fact, 2014 saw the release of 300: Rise of an Empire - based on Miller's graphic novel Xerxes - that saw Headey, Santoro, and other original cast members returning, and Sullivan Stapleton tapped for the lead role of Themistocles. Though Zack Snyder would serve as a co-writer on the screenplay, he did not return to direct. While not exactly the level of global box office that the original film was, \"Rise\" would go on to take in more than $337 million worldwide - and that's based on a reported budget of $110 million.", "source": {"uri": "bleedingcool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleeding Cool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ray_flook@bleedingcool.com", "name": "Ray Flook", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Television_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Television is developing a TV series set in the world of 300, the Zack Snyder movie based on Frank Miller's acclaimed graphic novel of the same name. The project will reportedly be a prequel, which will presumably center on the Spartans led by Leonidas before they went to war with Xerxes. The original film, of course, centered on a group of 300 Spartan soldiers who went into battle against the much larger Persian army led by Xerxes I. The 300 all died in the end, but they took out many more Persians with them. The story was previously adapted in the 1962 film 300 Spartans.\n\nWhile both 300 and 300 Spartans play pretty fast and loose with the history around the events, the story centers on the Battle of Thermopylae, which took place in 480 BC. According to Variety, who first reported the series in development, there are few details in place yet and no contracts are signed, but apparently they are looking at Zack Snyder to direct and executive produce the series. Other producers from the film, including Stone Quarry's Deborah Snyder and Wesley Coller, as well as Gianni Nunnari, Mark Canton, and Bernie Goldmann, are all in talks to return.\n\nThe idea of expanding the 300 universe is one that Snyder and Warners have been keen to explore for a while. The movie did get one sequel, but it underperformed. Other rumors suggested that there would be movies about other periods of history that would be made in a way that just \"felt like\" 300.\n\nBringing back familiar names and faces while rebooting the world feels fairly similar to Warner's approach to the Harry Potter TV show they're developing for Max. It seems plausible that a 300 series could end up on Max as well, although it would likely be a safer investment if it went to VHS itself.\n\nThe original 300 was a surprise hit. The movie, which starred Gerard Butler, Rodrigo Santoro, Lena Headey, David Wenham, Dominic West, Vincent Regan, Tom Wisdom, and Michael Fassbender, was made for around $65 million, and earned over $450 million at the box office. It remains one of the most profitable movies Snyder has ever made. Even the \"disappointing\" 300: Rise of an Empire cost $110 million and earned $337 million globally.\n\nThere are a number of popular movies that have been adapted for TV in recent years, or are currently in development. Fatal Attraction, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and I Know What You Did Last Summer got the treatment, and there are plans for Legally Blonde and Time Bandits shows coming soon.", "source": {"uri": "comicbook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comicbook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Thermopylae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sparta"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Persians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerxes_I", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xerxes I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Snyder", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zack Snyder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Television_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

With the series being so early in development at Warner Bros. TV and without many key members locked into place, a lot could change between now and its release.\n\nIGN has reached out to Warner Bros. TV for comment.\n\nSnyder's 300 tells the bloody story of Roman leader King Leonidas and the fight he and his 300 Spartans led against the Persian army. It's also based on Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name. The film, which starred Gerard Butler, Lena Headey, David Wenham, and Michael Fassbender, is known for its style, brutality, and slow-motion shots. A sequel, 300: Rise of an Empire, went on to release in 2014.\n\nSnyder reclaimed the rights to his lost sequel script, Blood and Ashes, late last year. The action film director called the script \"incredibly homoerotic\" and \"super violent\" at the time. It's unclear if it will have any ties to the new series with Warner Bros. TV.\n\n\"We got the rights back so we can make if we want it,\" Snyder said. \"I don't know what the marketplace is for an incredibly homoerotic, super violent, super sexual movie. But maybe it's perfect.\"\n\nFor more, you can read our original 9.9 review of 300. At the time, we said, \"Ultimately, this film combines an archetypal conflict, an ancient storytelling tradition reaching back as far as the Greeks themselves, and technique that makes it relevant to modern audiences. In other words, it's not clear whether great movie myths are born or bred, but 300 is unequivocally one of them.\"\n\nMichael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

No writer or platform is currently attached to the project.\n\nDeals are still being negotiated, but Zack Snyder, who directed and co-wrote \"300,\" is in talks to direct and executive produce the series. Deborah Snyder, who executive produced \"300,\" would also return as an executive producer under her and Zack's Stone Quarry production banner, with Stone Quarry's Wesley Collier also on board. Gianni Nunnari, Mark Canton, and Bernie Goldmann -- all of whom were producers on the film -- are likewise in talks to return.\n\nReps for WBTV declined to comment.\n\n\"300\" was based on the graphic novel of the same name by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley, which was itself loosely based on real historical events in addition to taking inspiration from the 1962 movie \"The 300 Spartans.\"\n\nIn the film, Leonidas, the king of Sparta, leads a small force of elite soldiers against the much larger army of Xerxes I of Persia. Gerard Butler starred as Leonidas, with Rodrigo Santoro as Xerxes. The cast also included Lena Headey, David Wenham, Dominic West, Vincent Regan, Tom Wisdom, and Michael Fassbender. The film proved to be a massive hit upon its release, generating over $450 million at the global box office against a reported budget of $65 million. It inspired numerous parodies as well, including the 2008 film \"Meet the Spartans\" as well as the \"South Park\" episode \"D-Yikes!\"\n\nA followup film, \"300: Rise of an Empire,\" was released in 2014. That film was based on Miller's graphic novel \"Xerxes\" with Snyder again co-writing the screenplay but not directing. Multiple original cast members returned, including Headey and Santoro, with Sullivan Stapleton playing the lead role of Themistocles. It was less well received than the original, but still grossed $337 million worldwide on a $110 million budget.\n\nShould the \"300\" series move forward, it would be the latest in a long line of films being adapted for television as the push for recognizable IP in the streaming world remains strong. Amazon, for example, recently ordered a \"Legally Blonde\" prequel series about the high school years of Elle Woods and released the \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\" TV series starring Donald Glover and Maya Erskine earlier this year. Apple, meanwhile, is prepping a \"Time Bandits\" series, while other recent examples include series based on movies like \"Fatal Attraction,\" \"Sexy Beast,\" and \"Dead Ringers.\"", "source": {"uri":

Deborah Snyder, who also served as an executive producer on the film, will also return. There is no streamer or network attached to the project just yet.\n\n300 was based on the graphic novel of the same name by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley and starred a very sweaty Gerard Butler as King Leonidas I, who leads 300 Spartans into battle against 300,000 Persians. You can infer how they got the name from here.\n\nThe cast of the original movie included Lena Headey, David Wenham, and Dominic West, though none of them are expected to be involved. Snyder co-wrote the sequel 300: Rise Of An Empire in 2014, which much of the cast returned for.\n\nWhile 300 was adapted from a book series, the plot is based on a real battle in the Greco-Persian Wars, so there are many adjacent stories to be told, perhaps one about 400 or maybe even 500 people.

Nearly 20 years ago, back in 2006, a little movie called \"300\" blew everyone's minds and kicked itself into the pop culture consciousness, teaching us all about the ancient Battle of Thermopylae, where King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and his 300 Spartans held off a massive Persian army under King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). Sure, it wasn't super historically accurate because it was based on the graphic novel by \"Sin City\" artist and scribe Frank Miller (with colors by Lynn Varley), but it was impossibly cool. It inspired all kinds of tributes and spoofs and even a spin-off film, \"300: Rise of an Empire,\" which showed the naval side of the battle, and now, it sounds like we're going to get a prequel TV series.\n\nAccording to Variety, Warner Bros. is developing a \"300\" prequel series with Snyder in talks to direct and executive produce. With the underwhelming response to \"Rebel Moon: Part Two,\" maybe it's a great time for Snyder to return to a well-known and loved franchise that's pretty much ready-made to please the vast majority of audiences.

Television and does not yet have any writers attached or even a specific streamer or channel it's heading to. All that's known is Snyder, his wife and producing partner Deborah Snyder, and many of the original film's producers are on board.\n\n300, of course, was released in 2006 and became one of the most popular and influential films of the era. It was only Snyder's second film but it put him on the map thanks to his bold, ambitious vision to bring the pages of the original Frank Miller/Lynn Varley comic book to life. Which he most certainly did, inspiring a whole slew of films with the film's saturated look and varying frame rates. In addition, the film spawned a theatrical sequel, 300: Rise of an Empire, which was not the smash of the original but still was a financial success.\n\nWhat specifically a 300 prequel series would be about is unclear. There are certainly any number of characters or battles the story could focus on in the time period. And, presumably, 2024 technology might make the look and feel of the show more affordable and accessible.

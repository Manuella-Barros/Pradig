Grace and five relievers held San Diego to four hits.\n\nGrace, who grew up in the Los Angeles area and pitched at UCLA, made his first big league start and his first start since 2012 when he was with Single-A Potomac. It was his 61st big league appearance.\n\nThe left-hander allowed two hits, struck out one and walked one.

The top pick overall in the 2009 draft, he's 6-1 against his hometown Padres.\n\nPadres: LHP Travis Wood (2-4, 6.46) is scheduled to make his fifth start since being obtained by San Diego.

Grace and five relievers held San Diego to four hits.\n\nGrace, who grew up in the Los Angeles area and pitched at UCLA, made his first big league start and his first start since 2012 when he was with Single-A Potomac.

I really put the bullpen in jeopardy tonight. For him to be able to step up and deliver what this ballclub needed, that really did a number for our team.\"\n\nScherzer, a two-time Cy Young Award winner who is 12-5 with a 2.25 ERA, said this is the same affliction that forced him out of a start at Miami on Aug. 1 after just one inning, but on the other side of the neck.

I was feeling good after my last start, but I forgot to do my neck exercises during this go around. I know it sounds stupid but it happened and for whatever reason it came back.

He retired Cory Spangenberg on a grounder to open the fifth and Baker came out to get him after 52 pitches.\n\nGrace said he found out before batting practice that he would start.\n\n\"I tried to treat this like a bullpen situation,\" he said. \"I wanted to get locked in early because I needed to go as long as I could in that situation. There was no room to throw more pitches than I should have. I tried to attack and be locked in as early as possible to try and extend my outing a little bit.\n\n\"I knew it would be a piece-together game in that situation. It was an awesome team win.

I just need to stay on top of my program. I've dealt with it before. If I stay strong, this goes away. Stay on the anti-inflammatories, do your exercises and this is a non-issue.\"\n\nHowie Kendrick hit a leadoff homer and drove in two runs for the Nationals.\n\nGrace made his first big league start and his first start since 2012 when he was with Single-A Potomac. It was his 61st big league appearance.\n\nThe left-hander allowed two hits, struck out one and walked one. He retired Cory Spangenberg on a grounder to open the fifth and Baker came out to get him after 52 pitches.\n\nGrace said he found out before batting practice that he would start.\n\n\"I tried to treat this like a bullpen situation,\" he said. \"I wanted to get locked in early because I needed to go as long as I could in that situation. There was no room to throw more pitches than I should have. I tried to attack and be locked in as early as possible to try and extend my outing a little bit.\n\n\"I knew it would be a piece-together game in that situation. It was an awesome team win. That was a pretty cool win to be a part of.\"\n\nShawn Kelley relieved Grace and with one out allowed Dusty Coleman's solo homer into the second deck in left field, his fourth.\n\nJoe Blanton (2-2) pitched a scoreless sixth for the win.\n\n\"You've got two hours out in front to switch gears and come off Max Scherzer,\" Padres manager Andy Green said. \"We just didn't have good at-bats throughout the day.\"\n\nKendrick homered to left on the third pitch from Luis Perdomo, his sixth leadoff shot this season and seventh homer overall. Kendrick also hit an RBI single with no outs in the seventh to chase Perdomo.\n\nWashington's Michael A. Taylor robbed Yangervis Solarte of a home run with a perfectly timed leap to catch the ball above the 396 sign in center field leading off the second, and right fielder Andrew Stevenson made a nice running catch of Wil Myers' fly ball with a runner on third to end the fourth.\n\nPerdomo (6-8) allowed five runs, three earned, and six hits while striking out five and walking three.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNationals: Strasburg, who went to high school in suburban Santee before pitching at San Diego State, is scheduled to come off the DL and start Saturday night. He hasn't pitched since July 23, when he went only two innings at Arizona. He went on the DL with an elbow nerve impingement. The top pick overall in the 2009 draft, he's 6-1 against his hometown Padres.\n\nPadres: LHP Travis Wood (2-4, 6.46) is scheduled to make his fifth start since being obtained by San Diego. He's 3-1 in eight all-time appearances at Petco Park, including six starts.\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T06:25:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd":

The Nationals ace was waylaid by a sore neck and was placed on the disabled list before the game.\n\nThat left Grace to make his first start in the majors in his 61st appearance. His last start came in 2012 when he was pitching for Class A Potomac.\n\nBut Grace, a left-hander with a fastball-sinker mix, was tough against the Padres. He surrendered two hits and a walk with a strikeout in 52 pitches.\n\nJoe Blanton (2-2), who pitched a scoreless sixth, got the win. Four other Washington pitchers combined to four-hit the Padres, with Sammy Solis getting the final three outs.\n\nLuis Perdomo (6-8) lost for the third time in his last four starts. He worked six-plus innings and allowed five runs (three earned), six hits and three walks with five strikeouts.\n\nThe Nationals scored twice in the seventh inning on a pinch-hitter Alejandro De Aza's sacrifice fly and Kendrick's RBI single for a 5-1 cushion to end Perdomo's night.\n\nAdam Lind's run-scoring single in the sixth scored Anthony Rendon for a 3-1 edge.\n\nDusty Coleman's 415-foot solo shot in the fifth, which landed in the second deck, pulled the Padres within 2-1.\n\nGrace was in a jam in the second after a leadoff single by Carlos Asuaje and a walk to Jose Pirela. But Grace got a double-play grounder from Yangervis Solarte and Wil Myers to fly out.\n\nWashington forged ahead 2-0 in the second when San Diego got sloppy. Coleman's errant throw from shortstop on a force at second allowed Matt Wieters to come around and score.\n\nKendrick started the game with a homer for the sixth time this season as the Nationals took a 1-0 lead. He redirected Perdomo's 83 mph slider over the left-center field fence.\n\nNOTES: Nationals manager Dusty Baker said RHP Stephen Strasburg will be activated off the disabled list and start Saturday. ... Nationals 1B Adam Lind was the lineup over Ryan Zimmerman, although Zimmerman entered in the seventh inning. ... Padres RF Hunter Renfroe was out of the lineup.

Not long before game time, the Washington Nationals scratched Max Scherzer, the two-time Cy Young Award winner who came within an out of throwing a complete game against San Diego earlier this year. As Scherzer went on the disabled list with neck inflammation, Matt Grace took the mound for his first major league start.\n\nWhat the Padres got instead: 4 1/3 scoreless innings against the little-known left-hander. Along the way, they found themselves on the wrong end of a homer-robbing catch. Then there were the self-inflicted wounds.\n\nThe first batter of the game, Howie Kendrick, homered off Luis Perdomo. A trio of errors aided the Nationals. The Padres never erased their deficit in a 7-1 loss at Petco Park.\n\nPerdomo completed six innings and reemerged for the top of the seventh. A shoddy defensive effort prevented him from recording another out. The right-hander allowed five runs, three earned.\n\n\"He was sinking the ball, I thought he was running it in on lefties well,\" Padres manager Andy Green said. \"I thought he was one of the few bright spots in the game. It was one of our uglier games, if not our ugliest game, in the last couple months. We did not play good baseball in any facet.\"\n\nPerdomo had no one but himself to blame for the first score. His third pitch of the night was a loopy, elevated slider. Kendrick crushed a drive to the seats in left-center.\n\n\"It was a pitch I missed,\" Perdomo said through an interpreter. \"It hung up there, and he took advantage of it. After that, I was able to calm down, relax, and I was able to do what I always do, which is get a lot of ground balls.\"\n\nIn the top of the second, a leadoff walk preceded a fielder's choice. Shortstop Dusty Coleman then made a diving stop, got to his feet and fired a low throw that skipped into right-field foul territory. Matt Wieters scored all the way from first.\n\nDown 2-0, the Padres were thwarted in an attempt to climb onto the scoreboard. Yangervis Solarte opened the bottom of the second with a deep drive. Nationals center fielder Michael A. Taylor leapt at the fence to intercept the ball.\n\nBenefiting from such defense, Grace permitted only two hits and a walk. He retired the first batter in the bottom of the fifth before former Padres reliever Shawn Kelley took the mound.\n\n\"Our at-bats weren't good,\" Green said. \"We knew what (Grace) did, we knew he sunk the baseball, and we just beat him into the ground all day.\"\n\nWith two outs, Coleman atoned for his error. He ambushed a first-pitch fastball from Kelley, hammering a solo shot 412 feet to left.\n\nPerdomo kept the Padres within a run over the next three innings, facing one batter more than the minimum.\n\n\"I felt really good,\" Perdomo said. \"Obviously, the results didn't end up the way we would've wanted. I got a lot of ground balls today. ... That's good, but at the same time, it was a game we lost.\"\n\nHe faltered with two outs in the sixth.

Grace made his first career start count, tossing 4 1/3 scoreless frames on 52 pitches, before handing it off to his fellow relievers. Shawn Kelley, Joe Blanton, Oliver Perez, Matt Albers and Sammy Solis combined to allow one run among them over the final 4 2/3.\n\n\"That was big,\" National manager Dusty Baker said. \"These guys, they kind of know when they're going to be used now. I was glad to see Kelley get his feet wet. Blanton is throwing the ball better than he had been all year. It's right on time. It's just great to see everybody contribute.\"\n\nThe Nats led throughout, following Howie Kendrick's leadoff blast against Luis Perdomo. The Padres right-hander was relatively sharp after that, but he got little help from his defense. In six-plus frames, Perdomo allowed five runs (three earned) on six hits and three walks.\n\n\"I felt really good,\" Perdomo said through an interpreter. \"Obviously the results didn't end up the way we would've wanted. I got a lot of ground balls today. That's the type of pitcher I am. I'm a ground-ball guy, and I was able to do that. That's good, but at the same time, it was a game we lost.\"\n\nSan Diego's only offense came in the fifth, when Dusty Coleman -- starting mainly because of his defense -- crushed his fourth home run, a solo shot to the upper deck in left field. But the Padres, who committed three errors and mustered only four hits, did little else to help Perdomo.\n\n\"He was one of the few bright spots in the game,\" Padres manager Andy Green said of Perdomo. \"It was one of our uglier games, if not our ugliest game, in the last couple months. We did not play good baseball in any facet.\"\n\nMOMENTS THAT MATTERED\n\nSloppy seventh: The Nationals put the game out of reach in the seventh inning, aided by two costly Padres errors. Andrew Stevenson led off the frame with a single, then stole second and reached third on Austin Hedges' errant thrown. Alejandro De Aza followed by lifting a deep fly ball to center field, where Manuel Margot dropped his two-handed catch attempt. De Aza reached second and scored on Kendrick's single, spelling the end of Perdomo's night.\n\n\"When you try to reach above your head with two heads while you're running full speed, it's an incredibly difficult thing to do,\" Green said of Margot's error. \"Just trust his athleticism. He catches almost everything with two hands, which isn't necessarily a problem. But sometimes you get out of outside of your body and you've got to reach back [with one].\"\n\nRobbery in center: The Padres didn't square up many baseballs against Grace. When they did, the Nationals' defense was there to negate it. Michael A. Taylor provided the night's best glovework with a brilliant catch to rob Yangervis Solarte of a home run in the second. Solarte smashed a deep drive to straightaway center, sending Taylor to the track. He leapt and caught the ball in one swift motion, barely making contact with the outfield wall.\n\n\"Awesome team win,\" Grace said. \"Mikey making that play in the beginning, and then just the defense in general, honestly. That's a pretty cool win to be a part of right there.\"\n\nQUOTABLE\n\n\"I really put the bullpen in jeopardy tonight and for him to be able to deliver what this ballclub needed, that really did a number for our team.\" -- Scherzer on Grace\n\n\"We had two hours to switch gears and come off Max Scherzer. We just didn't have good at-bats throughout the day.\" -- Green, when asked about the impact of the Nationals' pitching switch\n\nSOUND SMART WITH YOUR FRIENDS\n\nThe Padres were held without an extra-base hit for the first time since June 19 -- a span of 51 games.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\nNationals: Stephen Strasburg, a San Diego native, is scheduled to come off the disabled list Saturday to face the Padres at 8:40 p.m. ET. The right-hander's 3.25 ERA was the sixth best in the National League entering play Friday.\n\nPadres: Travis Wood gets the ball Saturday as the Padres face the Nationals in the third game of their four-game set. It will be Wood's ninth career appearance at Petco Park, where he owns a 2.75 lifetime ERA.

Max Scherzer, the Washington Nationals' ace, was supposed to pitch against the San Diego Padres. It was supposed to be another opportunity for him to pad his Cy Young credentials against a team he thoroughly dominated earlier in the season. It was supposed to be a rare relatively stress-free night for Baker, a manager who has had to mix and match through the summer to work around the slew of injuries to his roster. Instead, Grace, a solid left-hander whose starting experience since he was converted to reliever in 2013 was limited to one outing for Class AAA Syracuse in April, was suddenly pressed into action.\n\n[Nationals ace Max Scherzer placed on DL with neck inflammation]\n\nThere wasn't much time to evaluate the situation. Scherzer had informed the club of his sore neck just minutes earlier, which initiated the frantic 11th-hour change and later a move to the disabled list. Baker knew the most innings Grace had logged in a game this season was 2\u2154 on two occasions. That was about it. He just hoped Grace would minimize his pitches and claw as deep into the game as possible. But Grace exceeded those expectations in Washington's 7-1 victory on a night when the Nationals' seemingly endless depth won them another baseball game.\n\nThe Los Angeles native, whose family took a train Friday down to San Diego to attend the game without knowing he would start, tossed 4\u2153 scoreless innings before five relievers combined to close it out. He yielded two hits. He walked one and posted a strikeout. He received some help from Michael A. Taylor in the second inning, when the center fielder robbed Yangervis Solarte of a leadoff home run with a leaping catch on the warning track. It was a commendable impression of Mad Max, one with more contact and less snarling but similar results.\n\n[Ryan Madson will test his sprained finger on Saturday]\n\nWhile Grace set the tone on the mound for the 73-47 Nationals, a few other fill-ins provided the run support. Howie Kendrick, acquired last month, began the game with a solo home run off Padres right-hander Luis Perdomo and added an RBI single in the seventh to continue his blistering tenure was a National. Adam Lind, starting for Ryan Zimmerman at first base, smacked an RBI single in the sixth. Alejandro De Aza, called up on Wednesday, knocked in a run and scored another. Right fielder Andrew Stevenson, who began the season with Class AA Harrisburg, singled and scored.\n\nFor good measure, Daniel Murphy (RBI single) and Anthony Rendon (sacrifice fly), two of the few regular starters remaining for the Nationals, added a couple insurance runs in the ninth. It was a collective effort with help from a bunch of players that weren't on Washington's Opening Day roster, the kind that the Nationals have relied on in recent weeks to sustain their mammoth lead in the National League East.\n\nIt then fell on the bullpen to piece together the remaining outs. Shawn Kelley was the first reliever Baker called on, replacing Grace with one out in the fifth. It was the right-hander's first outing since June 16, and, like most of his outings before he landed on the disabled list with a trapezius strain, Kelley surrendered a home run. The second batter Kelley faced, Dusty Coleman, a 30-year-old rookie, smacked a solo shot to left field to cut Washington's lead to 2-1. It was the 10th home run Kelley allowed this season in 18\u2154 innings.\n\nFrom there, Joe Blanton, Oliver Perez, Matt Albers, and Sammy Solis combined to hold San Diego (54-68) to one hit and two walks over the final four innings. They partnered to finish off what one of their relief corps comrades started on a night that began with yet another injury.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T06:09:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 3228,

He labored a bit in the third and fourth but twice escaped with a runner in scoring position.\n\nGrace did get some help from his defense, most notably Michael A. Taylor, who made a spectacular leaping grab of Yangervis Solarte's second-inning drive to center field that might have otherwise cleared the wall for a home run.\n\nAnthony Rendon also made a couple of nice plays at third base, and Andrew Stevenson made a running grab of Wil Myers' sinking liner to end the fourth.\n\nHowie Kendrick ensured Grace would take the mound with a lead already in hand when he belted the game's third pitch to left-center for his seventh homer of the season, his fifth in only 56 plate appearances since his acquisition from the Phillies.\n\nThe Nationals then made it 2-0 in the top of the second when Matt Wieters, hardly known for his foot speed, hustled down the line to beat out what looked like it would be a routine double play, then scored all the way from first on shortstop Dusty Coleman's subsequent throwing error.\n\nUpdate: With six innings in the books, the Nationals have put themselves in position to win despite the difficult circumstances. They now lead 3-1, with both teams swapping runs in the bottom of the fifth and top of the sixth. After Grace was pulled with one out in the fifth, Shawn Kelley entered for his first major league appearance in two months. He struck out the first batter he faced but then served up a towering home run to Coleman. That, remarkably, was the 10th homer Kelley has surrendered in 18 2/3 innings this season. The Nats got the run right back, though, on Adam Lind's two-out RBI single in the sixth. That made it 3-1, and it remains there after Joe Blanton tossed a scoreless inning.\n\nUpdate II: The Nationals have played excellent defense tonight. The Padres ... have not. That's a big reason why the Nats now lead 5-1 after seven innings. San Diego's defense butchered a couple of balls in the top of the seventh, with catcher Austin Hedges throwing a ball away and center fielder Manuel Margot dropping a fairly routine fly ball. The Nationals bullpen, meanwhile, continues to get the job done. Oliver P\u00e9rez recorded the first two outs of the seventh before giving way to Matt Albers, who got the final out and is now positioned to pitch the eighth as well.\n\nUpdate III: They didn't have Scherzer. They had to cobble together nine innings from six relievers. And guess what, the Nationals still won in a rout. Final: 7-1. Grace was the most effective pitcher tonight, but because he was ineligible to earn the win after throwing fewer than five innings, the official scorer decided to give it to Blanton, who retired two of three batters he faced (even though Albers retired all four batters he faced, three via strikeout). The pitching staff collectively put up a final line that looked very Scherzer-esque: 9 IP, 4 H, 1 R, 3 BB, 8 K, 116 pitches, 78 strikes.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T03:18:00Z", "extractedDates": null,

He went six innings, allowing two runs and four hits while striking out eight and walking one.\n\nHe hadn't pitched since July 23, when he went only two innings at Arizona.

He was unscathed until the fifth, when he allowed a one-out single to Jose Lobaton and a two-out double to Adrian Sanchez. The run was unearned because of Woods' throwing error on Strasburg's sacrifice bunt that advanced Lobaton.\n\nWood allowed just the unearned run on three hits in seven innings, with two strikeouts and two walks.\n\nBrad Hand pitched the ninth for his 11th save.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nNationals: Strasburg took the roster spot of RHP Max Scherzer, who went on the DL Friday night, retroactive to Tuesday, with inflammation in his neck.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNationals: LHP Gio Gonzalez (11-5, 2.49 ERA) is scheduled to start Sunday's series finale.

The left-handed reliever learned he would make his first career start slightly before batting practice and tried to keep a regular routine.\n\n\"Just tried to treat it as bullpen appearance or coming out in a normal situation,\" Grace said. \"I threw beforehand. I didn't do anything that a normal starter would do.\"\n\nGrace was last a regular starter in 2012 for Class A Advanced Potomac. His only start since then came in April when he pitched three innings in a spot start for Triple-A Syracuse. Then, he had a day's notice.\n\n\"He threw the ball great,\" Scherzer said. \"To be able to do that in a bind, for him to go out there and give us 4 1/3, that's exactly what we needed. I really put the bullpen in jeopardy tonight and for him to be able to deliver what this ballclub needed, that really did a number for our team.\"\n\nGrace and manager Dusty Baker hoped for a three-inning outing, but Grace pitched efficiently. He retired the first six Padres, with Michael Taylor's leaping grab at the center-field wall to deny Yangervis Solarte a home run opening the second inning.\n\nAustin Hedges' leadoff single in the third did Grace no harm after a sequence of strikeout, sacrifice bunt and groundout followed.\n\nPitching in a fourth inning for the first time, Grace allowed a single to Carlos Asuaje and walked Jose Pirela to begin the frame.\n\nBaker said before the game he hoped Grace would be able to use double plays to keep his pitch count down, and the one time Grace needed one, he got it, as Solarte pounded a grounder to third baseman Anthony Rendon to start an around-the-horn double play. Andrew Stevenson chased down Wil Myers' liner to right to end the fourth.\n\nGrace took the mound in the fifth as Baker sought a lefty-lefty matchup against Cory Spangenberg. It worked in Washington's favor, as Spangenberg grounded out to Rendon to complete Grace's night.\n\nHe exited to an ovation from Nats fans behind the team's third-base dugout, having thrown 52 pitches, one shy of his career high. In his first outing since Sunday, Grace dropped his ERA to 3.84.\n\n\"Do what you can to contribute,\" Grace said. \"I haven't really felt like I've been contributing much as of late, so to take advantage of that opportunity and at least do something for a team win there was nice.\"\n\n\"He's a guy that has done everything we've asked him to do,\" Baker said. \"He's started, he's gone long, he's gone middle, he's gone short. Basically keep the ball in the ballpark, throws ground balls, throws strikes and is getting better. He has pitched his way onto the team. He's doing a great job.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T07:42:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5607843399047852, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373612", "time": "07:42:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373612", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "303564", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "score": 3}, {"id": "303571", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "score": 5}, {"id": "303714", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "score": 3}, {"id": "304989", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Disabled list"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disabled_list", "score": 4}, {"id": "304992", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "score": 2}, {"id": "305018", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "score": 2}, {"id": "305020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Innings"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "score": 4}, {"id": "305786", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Batting average"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average", "score": 3}, {"id": "305791", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "score": 2}, {"id": "305865", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "score": 4}, {"id": "310473", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "score": 4}, {"id": "310537", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "score": 2}, {"id": "310589", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of baseball (S)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_baseball_(S)", "score": 3}, {"id": "310659", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "score": 3}, {"id": "310667", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Max Scherzer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Scherzer", "score": 4}, {"id": "310901", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "score": 2}, {"id": "311919", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baseball rules"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_rules", "score": 2}, {"id": "312733", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "score": 4}, {"id": "314182", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "score": 3}, {"id": "325677", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Double play"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "score": 3}, {"id": "325678", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "score": 2}, {"id": "331803", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "355111", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Anthony Rendon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Rendon", "score": 2}, {"id": "358790", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice bunt"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_bunt", "score": 2}, {"id": "367969", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Dusty Baker"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusty_Baker", "score": 3}, {"id": "432190", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Wil Myers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wil_Myers", "score": 2}, {"id": "509163", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Yangervis Solarte"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangervis_Solarte", "score": 2}, {"id": "792644", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Andrew Stevenson"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Stevenson", "score": 2}], "image": "http://m.mlb.com/assets/images/7/4/4/249375744/cuts/1280x720/cut.jpg", "timeCrawl": "07:42:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Nationals' Matt Grace steps up for Scherzer", "originalArticle": null}

In fact, it was anything but -- and that takes precedence for a club with a 14-game division lead. Strasburg's first start since July 23 was a six-inning unmitigated success. His fastball popped, bouncing between 96 and 98 mph. He offset the heat with an effective curveball and a sharp change-up. His stuff was electric. His right elbow impingement, which sent him to the disabled list, was all but forgotten.\n\nStrasburg threw 91 pitches, 61 for strikes. He compiled eight strikeouts -- all in a 13-batter span between the second and fifth innings -- to one walk. He was sharp as ever. But he exited with the Nationals (73-48) trailing, 2-1, because Yangervis Solarte crushed a mistake for a two-run home run and Washington's anemic lineup produced just three hits.\n\nThe Nationals' offense took another hit a few hours before first pitch, when Daniel Murphy, who was in Washington's original starting lineup, was scratched. Manager Dusty Baker said he made the decision because he sensed Murphy was dragging in recent days. The move left Washington with Anthony Rendon, Ryan Zimmerman, and Michael A. Taylor as the only starters they expect to start in the playoffs.\n\nAndrew Stevenson and Adrian Sanchez, both of whom began the season with Class AA Harrisburg, batted first and second. Alejandro de Aza, a National since Wednesday, made his first start for the club in left field and batted seventh. Catcher Jose Lobaton, who began the night with a .153 batting average, batted eighth.\n\nWashington made Wood, who allowed a run on three hits over seven innings, work in the first inning, forcing the left-hander to throw 36 pitches to five batters. But the Nationals failed to get a run out of it. They would score their only run in the fifth inning, when Sanchez smacked a two-run double off the wall in left field to drive in Lobaton.\n\nThe Nationals were facing a deficit because command cost Strasburg in the first inning. He threw a first-pitch strike to one of the five batters he faced in the frame. The third batter, Jose Pirela, singled. The fourth batter, Solarte, turned on a 96-mph fastball for the game's key blow, a two-out blast. Matt Wieters was set up over the outside corner, but the pitch ended up over the inner half and up, right in Solarte's wheelhouse and right over the wall in right field.\n\nStrasburg (10-4) retired 10 straight batters after Solarte's homer, striking out five of them and casting aside any doubts of his status. He was ruthlessly efficient. He was dominant. He was Strasburg. And Strasburg, when healthy, is one of baseball's best pitchers.\n\nThe Padres (55-68) notched their next hit in the fifth inning, when Cory Spangenberg tapped a perfectly placed slow dribbler down the first base line. Strasburg chased after it, but couldn't get to the ball before first baseman Zimmerman, who was waiting by the bag, snatched it and tried to tag Spangenberg. But Spangenberg reached. An irritated Strasburg shook his head and took out his frustration on the next three batters, striking them out to plow through the fifth inning on 73 pitches with eight strikeouts -- five on change-ups.\n\nStrasburg would walk his first batter, Manuel Margot, to start the sixth inning. But the lapse was fleeting. He then induced a fielder's choice groundout from Carlos Asuaje, whom Strasburg then picked off for the inning's second out. Pirela then smacked a single to right field on the next pitch to bring up Solarte.\n\nStrasburg asked for a ball change as pitching coach Mike Maddux ran out to chat with him before he faced the only Padre to inflict any damage. Strasburg's pitch count was nearing 90. The end of his return was near.\n\nEvidently the plan was to attack Solarte with curveballs because he snapped one by Solarte for a called strike to begin the at-bat and threw him another. Solarte barely connected on the second offering, sending a slow chopper in Strasburg's direction, which he easily fielded to conclude the inning and his night with the Nationals down a run.\n\nThe margin doubled in the seventh inning, when Sammy Solis allowed the three batters he faced to reach before he was pulled. Matt Albers then entered and traded a double play for a run to make it 3-1. That was all the Padres could muster as Albers escaped and stranded a runner on third base.\n\nBut the Nationals' shorthanded offense did not capi\u00adtal\u00adize, but that was ultimately a secondary concern. What was most important happened in the first six frames, when Stephen Strasburg returned, looking every bit like himself.\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nMadson not seeing progress in his sprained

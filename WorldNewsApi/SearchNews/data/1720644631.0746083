At present, 119 countries, including Nepal, are signatories to the ISA Framework Agreement, of which 98 countries have submitted the necessary instruments of ratification to become full members of the ISA.Responding to queries raised by lawmakers from various political parties, Basnet said that the agreement was tabled in keeping with the national interest of the country as clean energy is essential for minimising the impacts of climate change.\u201cThe installation of solar energy will be important for Nepal's development,\u201d he pointed out and informed the House that the government has already moved the process for the generation of 1,000 MW through solar power in the next couple of years.A competitive bidding for Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) has already started for the same and bidding for PPA of 800 MW has already opened, he added.Rajendra Khatrichhetri, a lawmaker belonging to opposition Nepali Congress, welcomed the government's move as he said, \u201cThis is a good proposal as it will provide cheap and affordable energy to the general public and also helps to minimise the impacts of climate change.\u201d Currently, Nepal has 13 projects generating 68.38 MW of solar power, according to Nepal's Energy Development Department. In September 2023, Nepal announced that it plans to develop 30,000 MW of electricity by 2035 and would club hydropower and solar power.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/world/nepal-parliament-ratification-agreement-international-solar-alliance-9380036/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/Nepal-.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:09:01", "author": null, "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.109}

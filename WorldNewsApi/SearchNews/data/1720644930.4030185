However, the talk show host referred to the order as a \u201cHail Mary.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s finally, after saying he couldn\u2019t do anything, he\u2019s gonna issue an executive order \u2014 by the way, this is the same executive order Trump tried to get through the courts, and they didn\u2019t let him do it,\u201d Maher said. \u201cBut he\u2019s gonna finally try it six months before the election, which says we will put a cap of 2,500 now, asylum seekers coming in. If it passes 2,500, if it\u2019s 2,501, then we automatically close the border.\u201d According to the comedian, if Biden were to lose the election, it would be for one of two reasons: \u201cHe\u2019s old\u201d or immigration. More than 10 million immigrants who have reportedly entered the country illegally since Biden took office. It is the most recorded in that amount of time of any administration. Maher pointed out that it\u2019s also \u201cmore than the number of people who live in Nicaragua. He let in all of Nicaragua.\u201d \u201cBut when [the number of asylum seekers] goes down to 1,500, then we resume standard asylum procedures. It\u2019s like surge-pricing with Uber,\u201d Maher said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bizarre scheme that, of course, has pleased nobody. It looks like a last minute \u2014 it looks like he did nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing. Then, of course, he did try through Congress, and the Republicans purposely spiked that football. They didn\u2019t want this bill because they wanted it as an issue. So they could have fixed it themselves. They didn\u2019t. But now it looks like this is his last-minute, before-the-election Hail Mary pass, and it\u2019s not gonna succeed.\u201d Maher implied the Democratic Party isn\u2019t willing to answer the question of \u201chow many is too many\u201d immigrants to allow into the country. Instead, Maher claims the party would consider any limit \u201cracist.\u201d CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Meanwhile, these border policies don\u2019t seem to be winning over Latino support. A March poll found President Joe Biden is still leading Trump in favorability with Latino voters, with Biden at 41% compared to Trump at 32%. However, this was a decrease from another poll in December 2021 where Biden had a favorability of 53%, while Trump\u2019s favorability was at 24%. Pew Research Center estimates there will be 36.2 million eligible Latino voters this year. That is an increase from the 32.3 million in 2020. Some 59% voted for Biden that year.", "summary": "Talk show host Bill Maher predicted President Joe Biden&#8216;s border executive order is &#8220;not gonna succeed.&#8221; Maher referred to Biden&#8217;s asylum ban on all immigrants caught crossing the border during his Friday episode of Real Time with Bill Maher.

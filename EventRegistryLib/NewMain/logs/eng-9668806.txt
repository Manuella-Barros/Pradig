Without some thinning allowed on these forests, he said there is a risk of losing more trees.\n\nThe exceptions under which logging would be allowed are unlikely to placate timber industry representatives and Republicans in Congress. They've pushed back against any new restrictions.

(AP) -- The Biden administration is advancing its plan to restrict logging within old growth forests that are increasingly threatened by climate change, with exceptions that include cutting trees to make forests less susceptible to wildfires, according to a U.S. government analysis obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nThe analysis -- expected to be published Friday -- shows that officials intend to reject a blanket prohibition on old growth logging that's long been sought by some environmentalists. Officials concluded that such a sweeping ban would make it harder to thin forests to better protect communities against wildfires that have grown more severe as the planet warms.\n\n\"To ensure the longevity of old growth forests, we're going to have to take proactive management to protect against wildfire and insects and disease,\" Forest Service Deputy Chief Chris French told AP in an interview. Without some thinning allowed on these forests, he said there is a risk of losing more trees.\n\nThe exceptions under which logging would be allowed are unlikely to placate timber industry representatives and Republicans in Congress. They've pushed back against any new restrictions. French asserted the impacts on timber companies would be minimal.\n\n\"There's so little timber sales that occur right now in old growth...that the overall effects are very small,\" French said.\n\nThe proposed changes mark a shift within an agency that historically promoted logging. They're expected to be finalized before President Joe Biden's first term ends in January and come after the Democrat issued a 2022 executive order that directed the U.S. Department of Agriculture to identify old growth forests across the nation and devise ways to conserve them.\n\nThat order touched off a flurry of disagreement over what fits under the definition of old growth and how those trees should be managed.\n\nOld-growth forests, such as the storied giant sequoia stands of northern California, have layer upon layer of undisturbed trees and vegetation. There's wide consensus on the importance of preserving them -- both symbolically as marvels of nature, and more practically because their trunks and branches store large amounts of carbon that can be released when forests burn, adding to climate change.\n\nUnderlining the urgency of the issue are wildfires that killed thousands of giant sequoias in recent years. The towering giants are concentrated in about 70 groves scattered along the western side of the Sierra Nevada range.\n\nMost old growth forests across the U.S. were lost to logging as the nation developed over the past few centuries. Yet pockets of ancient trees remain, scattered across the U.S. including in California, the Pacific Northwest and areas of the Rocky Mountains. Larger expanses of old growth survive in Alaska, such as within the Tongass National Forest.\n\nOld growth timber harvests in the Tongass were limited in 2021 to only small commercial sales. Those would no longer occur under the administration's proposal.\n\nThe new analysis follows a separate report on threats to old growth forests that was finalized last week. It concluded wildfire, insects and disease have been the main killers of old growth trees since 2000, accounting for almost 1,400 square miles losses (3,600 square kilometers).\n\nBy contrast, logging on federal lands cut down about about 14 square miles of old growth (36 square kilometers). That figure has been seized on by timber industry representatives who argue further restrictions aren't needed.\n\n\"Most forest plans already restrict harvest in old growth stands,\" said Bill Imbergamo with the Federal Forest Resource Coalition, an industry group. \"A binding restriction on timber harvest is not where their priority ought to be.\"\n\nEnvironmentalists have urged the administration to go even further as they seek to stop logging projects on federal lands in Oregon, South Dakota, Montana, Idaho and other states.\n\nJamie Williams, president of The Wilderness Society, said the proposal was \"a step in the right direction.\"\n\n\"But it must go further to protect and restore resilient old-growth forests in a way that meets the challenges of the changing climate,\" he added.\n\nUnder former President Donald Trump, federal officials sought to open up millions of acres of West Coast forests to potential logging. Federal wildlife officials reversed the move in 2021 after determining political appointees under Trump relied on faulty science to justify drastically shrinking areas of forest that are considered crucial habitats for the imperiled northern spotted owl.", "source": {"uri": "maryvilleforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Maryville Forum"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(AP) -- The Biden administration is advancing its plan to restrict logging within old growth forests that are increasingly threatened by climate change, with exceptions that include cutting trees to make forests less susceptible to wildfires, according to a U.S. government analysis obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nThe analysis -- expected to be published Friday -- shows that officials intend to reject a blanket prohibition on old growth logging that's long been sought by some environmentalists. Officials concluded that such a sweeping ban would make it harder to thin forests to better protect communities against wildfires that have grown more severe as the planet warms.\n\n\"To ensure the longevity of old growth forests, we're going to have to take proactive management to protect against wildfire and insects and disease,\" Forest Service Deputy Chief Chris French told AP in an interview. Without some thinning allowed on these forests, he said there is a risk of losing more trees.\n\nThe exceptions under which logging would be allowed are unlikely to placate timber industry representatives and Republicans in Congress. They've pushed back against any new restrictions. French asserted the impacts on timber companies would be minimal.\n\n\"There's so little timber sales that occur right now in old growth...that the overall effects are very small,\" French said.\n\nThe proposed changes mark a shift within an agency that historically promoted logging. They're expected to be finalized before President Joe Biden's first term ends in January and come after the Democrat issued a 2022 executive order that directed the U.S. Department of Agriculture to identify old growth forests across the nation and devise ways to conserve them.\n\nThat order touched off a flurry of disagreement over what fits under the definition of old growth and how those trees should be managed.\n\nOld-growth forests, such as the storied giant sequoia stands of northern California, have layer upon layer of undisturbed trees and vegetation. There's wide consensus on the importance of preserving them -- both symbolically as marvels of nature, and more practically because their trunks and branches store large amounts of carbon that can be released when forests burn, adding to climate change.\n\nUnderlining the urgency of the issue are wildfires that killed thousands of giant sequoias in recent years. The towering giants are concentrated in about 70 groves scattered along the western side of the Sierra Nevada range.\n\nMost old growth forests across the U.S. were lost to logging as the nation developed over the past few centuries. Yet pockets of ancient trees remain, scattered across the U.S. including in California, the Pacific Northwest and areas of the Rocky Mountains. Larger expanses of old growth survive in Alaska, such as within the Tongass National Forest.\n\nOld growth timber harvests in the Tongass were limited in 2021 to small commercial sales. Those would no longer occur under the administration's proposal.\n\nThe new analysis follows a separate report on threats to old growth forests that was finalized last week. It concluded wildfire, insects and disease have been the main killers of old growth trees since 2000, accounting for almost 1,400 square miles losses (3,600 square kilometers).\n\nBy contrast, logging on federal lands cut down about about 14 square miles of old growth (36 square kilometers). That figure has been seized on by timber industry representatives who argue further restrictions aren't needed.\n\n\"A binding restriction on timber harvest is not where their priority ought to be,\" said Bill Imbergamo with the Federal Forest Resource Coalition, an industry group. He added that exceptions by federal officials to allow some logging could be challenged in court, which could tie up even small logging projects that are focused on reducing wildfire risks.\n\nEnvironmentalists have urged the administration to go even further as they seek to stop logging projects on federal lands in Oregon, South Dakota, Montana, Idaho and other states.\n\nJamie Williams, president of The Wilderness Society, said the proposal was \"a step in the right direction.\"\n\n\"But it must go further to protect and restore resilient old-growth forests in a way that meets the challenges of the changing climate,\" he added.\n\nThe Forest Service inventory identified about 39,000 square miles (100,000 square kilometers) of old growth across the U.S. and 100,000 square miles (275,000 square kilometers) of mature forests that have not yet reached old growth status.\n\nEnvironmentalists lobbied unsuccessfully for logging restrictions to be extended to those mature forests.\n\nUnder former President Donald Trump, federal officials sought to open up millions of acres of West Coast forests to potential logging. Federal wildlife officials reversed the move in 2021 after determining political appointees under Trump relied on faulty science to justify drastically shrinking areas of forest that are considered crucial habitats for the imperiled northern spotted owl.", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Santa Maria Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(AP) -- The Biden administration is advancing its plan to restrict logging within old-growth forests that are increasingly threatened by climate change, with exceptions that include cutting trees to make forests less susceptible to wildfires, according to a U.S. government analysis obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nThe analysis, which is expected to be published Friday, shows that officials intend to reject a blanket prohibition on old-growth logging that's long been sought by some environmentalists. Officials concluded that such a sweeping ban would make it harder to thin forests to better protect communities against wildfires that have grown more severe as the planet has warmed.\n\n\"To ensure the longevity of old-growth forests, we're going to have to take proactive management to protect against wildfire and insects and disease,\" Forest Service Deputy Chief Chris French told the AP. Without some thinning allowed on these forests, he said there is a risk of losing more trees.\n\nThe exceptions under which logging would be allowed are unlikely to placate the timber industry and Republicans in Congress, who have pushed back against any new restrictions. French asserted that the impacts on timber companies would be minimal.\n\n\"There's so little timber sales that occur right now in old-growth ... that the overall effects are very small,\" French said.\n\nThe U.S. timber industry employs about 860,000 people, which is about 30% fewer than in 2001, according to government data. Much of their work shifted in recent years to timber from private and state lands, after harvests from national forests dropped sharply beginning in the 1990s due to new policies, changing lumber markets and other factors.\n\nThe proposed changes on old-growth mark a shift for an agency that has historically promoted logging. They're expected to be finalized before Democratic President Joe Biden's term ends in January, and they come after he issued a 2022 executive order that directed the U.S. Department of Agriculture to identify old-growth forests across the nation and devise ways to conserve them.\n\nThat order touched off a flurry of disagreement over what fits under the definition of old-growth and how those trees should be managed.\n\nOld-growth forests, such as the storied giant sequoia stands of Northern California, have layer upon layer of undisturbed trees and vegetation. There's wide consensus on the importance of preserving them -- both symbolically as marvels of nature, and more practically because their trunks and branches store large amounts of carbon that can be released when forests burn, adding to climate change.\n\nUnderlining the urgency of the issue are wildfires that killed thousands of giant sequoias in recent years.\n\nMost old-growth forests across the U.S. were lost to logging as the nation developed over the past few centuries. Yet pockets of ancient trees remain, scattered across the U.S. including in California, the Pacific Northwest and areas of the Rocky Mountains. Larger expanses of old growth survive in Alaska, such as within the Tongass National Forest.\n\nOld-growth timber harvests in the Tongass were limited in 2021 to small commercial sales. Those would no longer occur under the administration's proposal.\n\nThe new analysis follows a separate report on threats to old-growth forests that was finalized last week. It concluded that wildfires, insects and disease have been the main killers of old-growth trees since 2000, accounting for almost 1,400 square miles (3,600 square kilometers) of losses.\n\nBy contrast, logging on federal lands cut down about 14 square miles (36 square kilometers) of old-growth forests. That figure has been seized on by timber industry representatives who argue that further restrictions aren't needed.\n\n\"A binding restriction on timber harvest is not where their priority ought to be,\" said Bill Imbergamo, of the Federal Forest Resource Coalition, an industry group. He added that exceptions by federal officials to allow some logging could be challenged in court, which could tie up even small logging projects that are focused on reducing wildfire risks.\n\nEnvironmentalists have urged the administration to go even further as they seek to stop logging projects on federal lands in Oregon, South Dakota, Montana, Idaho and other states.\n\nJamie Williams, president of The Wilderness Society, said the proposal was \"a step in the right direction.\"\n\n\"But it must go further to protect and restore resilient old-growth forests in a way that meets the challenges of the changing climate,\" he added.\n\nGovernment inventories have identified about 50,000 square miles (130,000 square kilometers) of old-growth forests in federal lands across the U.S. and 125,000 square miles (320,000 square kilometers) of mature forests that haven't yet reached old-growth status. That includes land overseen by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, which in April adopted a rule intended to put conservation on equal footing with extractive industries such as logging and energy development.\n\nEnvironmentalists lobbied unsuccessfully for the Forest Service to extend its old-growth logging restrictions to mature forests. That means those forests remain exposed to potential commercial logging, said Blaine Miller McFeeley, of the environmental group EarthJustice.\n\n\"If you don't have protections for mature trees, there will never be a new cohort of old-growth,\" he said.\n\nUnder former President Donald Trump, federal officials sought to open up huge areas of West Coast forests to potential logging. Federal wildlife officials reversed the move in 2021 after determining that political appointees under Trump relied on faulty science to justify drastically shrinking areas of forest that are considered crucial habitats for the imperiled northern spotted owl.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(AP) - The Biden administration is advancing its plan to restrict logging within old growth forests that are increasingly threatened by climate change, with exceptions that include cutting trees to make forests less susceptible to wildfires, according to a U.S. government analysis obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nThe analysis - expected to be published Friday - shows that officials intend to reject a blanket prohibition on old growth logging that's long been sought by some environmentalists. Officials concluded that such a sweeping ban would make it harder to thin forests to better protect communities against wildfires that have grown more severe as the planet warms.\n\n\"To ensure the longevity of old growth forests, we\u00b4re going to have to take proactive management to protect against wildfire and insects and disease,\" Forest Service Deputy Chief Chris French told AP in an interview. Without some thinning allowed on these forests, he said there is a risk of losing more trees.\n\nThe exceptions under which logging would be allowed are unlikely to placate timber industry representatives and Republicans in Congress. They've pushed back against any new restrictions. French asserted the impacts on timber companies would be minimal.\n\n\"There\u00b4s so little timber sales that occur right now in old growth...that the overall effects are very small,\" French said.\n\nThe proposed changes mark a shift within an agency that historically promoted logging. They're expected to be finalized before President Joe Biden's first term ends in January and come after the Democrat issued a 2022 executive order that directed the U.S. Department of Agriculture to identify old growth forests across the nation and devise ways to conserve them.\n\nFILE - Climbing assistant Lawrence Schultz ascends the Three Sisters sequoia tree during an Archangel Ancient Tree Archive expedition to plant sequoia seedlings on Oct. 26, 2021, in Sequoia Crest, Calif.

(AP Photo/Noah Berger, File)\n\nThat order touched off a flurry of disagreement over what fits under the definition of old growth and how those trees should be managed.\n\nOld-growth forests, such as the storied giant sequoia stands of northern California, have layer upon layer of undisturbed trees and vegetation. There\u00b4s wide consensus on the importance of preserving them - both symbolically as marvels of nature, and more practically because their trunks and branches store large amounts of carbon that can be released when forests burn, adding to climate change.\n\nUnderlining the urgency of the issue are wildfires that killed thousands of giant sequoias in recent years. The towering giants are concentrated in about 70 groves scattered along the western side of the Sierra Nevada range.\n\nMost old growth forests across the U.S. were lost to logging as the nation developed over the past few centuries. Yet pockets of ancient trees remain, scattered across the U.S. including in California, the Pacific Northwest and areas of the Rocky Mountains. Larger expanses of old growth survive in Alaska, such as within the Tongass National Forest.\n\nOld growth timber harvests in the Tongass were limited in 2021 to only small commercial sales. Those would no longer occur under the administration's proposal.\n\nThe new analysis follows a separate report on threats to old growth forests that was finalized last week. It concluded wildfire, insects and disease have been the main killers of old growth trees since 2000, accounting for almost 1,400 square miles losses (3,600 square kilometers).\n\nBy contrast, logging on federal lands cut down about about 14 square miles of old growth (36 square kilometers). That figure has been seized on by timber industry representatives who argue further restrictions aren't needed.\n\n\"Most forest plans already restrict harvest in old growth stands,\" said Bill Imbergamo with the Federal Forest Resource Coalition, an industry group. \"A binding restriction on timber harvest is not where their priority ought to be.\"\n\nEnvironmentalists have urged the administration to go even further as they seek to stop logging projects on federal lands in Oregon, South Dakota, Montana, Idaho and other states.\n\nJamie Williams, president of The Wilderness Society, said the proposal was \"a step in the right direction.\"\n\n\"But it must go further to protect and restore resilient old-growth forests in a way that meets the challenges of the changing climate,\" he added.\n\nUnder former President Donald Trump, federal officials sought to open up millions of acres of West Coast forests to potential logging. Federal wildlife officials reversed the move in 2021 after determining political appointees under Trump relied on faulty science to justify drastically shrinking areas of forest that are considered crucial habitats for the imperiled northern spotted owl.\n\nFILE - In this Aug. 24, 2020 photo, fire burns in the hollow of an old-growth redwood tree in Big Basin Redwoods State Park, Calif.

This question was posed by scientists, conservationists and politicians at the 7th European Congress on Conservation Biology (ECCB, 17-21 June 2024, Bologna, Italy). At their panel discussion \"The fate of primary and old-growth forests in Europe: 2018 - 2024 - 2030?\" on 18 June, MEP Thomas Waitz and four forest experts from Sweden, Poland, Romania and Austria took a look back at the past few years. From past successes and failures, they derived new ideas on what effective protection of old-growth forests in Europe could look like by 2030.\n\nDownfalls and successes for forest protection\n\nThomas Waitz, Member of the European Parliament for the Austrian Green Party, emphasises the importance of primary and old-growth forests for maintaining a high level of biodiversity. Waitz refers to the European Forest Strategy 2030 and is very clear in his demand: \"All remaining old-growth and primary forests must be strictly protected in line with the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030! Because almost all primary forests have already been lost. Illegal logging in some EU member states is worrying.\"\n\nAugustyn Mikos, forest policy expert from Poland, reported that decades of efforts have actually led to better protection of the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest in Poland. However, the largest primeval forest in the European lowlands is still not sufficiently protected. The reason for this problem is that decisions on nature conservation are not based on scientific evidence. \"We need strong institutions and regulations that make decisions on the protection of the most valuable forests independently of political changes. These institutions should be in the hands of experts and be subject to social and judicial control.\"\n\nGabriel P\u0103un, president of the conservation NGO Agent Green in Romania, addresses his concerns about ignoring science in policy-making: \"Climate change is a matter of life and death and we cannot afford to wait for the politics and society to catch up with science. We need a science revolution to reverse the ecstasy of destruction that leads the timber market and politics right now. The wood industry shall measure its results in number of species and not in number of cubic meters.\"\n\nSwedish forestry practitioner Martin Jentzen makes it clear what we need for the sustainable protection of forests in Europe: \"The average ecological quality of forests must be raised. To achieve this, we need an overall strategy with a sufficient economic basis to protect what is left of the forests with high nature conservation value. More ecologically educated foresters and forest owners could act more independently from the wood processing industry and thus reduce its strong influence forest management.\"\n\nCommunication strategist Matthias Schickhofer underlines: \"In view of the spread of disinformation campaigns by the industry and its political allies, scientists, activists and politicians need to step up their co-operation to push back manipulation and get the facts right. It is of central importance to strengthen co-operation and public activities with honest partners outside the scientific community\".\n\nConsensus on priorities in the protection of old-growth forests\n\nAll panelists agreed that the European Natura 2000 network of protected areas is of central importance for the effective conservation of the last remaining old-growth forests in Europe. However, the Natura 2000 network must be given substantially more funds for compensation of land owners and the comprehensive enforcement of both Habitats and Birds Directives in particular to ensure strict conservation of primary and old-growth forests within Natura 2000 sites.\n\nPanelists consider it a matter of urgency to rapidly improve the scientific basis for the protection of old-growth forests. The European Union can demonstrate its strength in international cooperation, especially in the comprehensive recording of the remaining natural forest remnants.\n\nFinally, this includes monitoring forestry and illegal activities in old-growth forests to be able to react quickly to acute threats to the forest. Many old-growth forests are hidden from public attention due to their location far from urban centres.\n\nOn the panel\n\nThe discussion was organised by Nuria Selva (Polish Academy of Sciences) and Stefan Kreft (Naturwald Akademie) and chaired by Stefan Kreft. These were the panelists:\n\nMartin Jentzen is a Swedish forest engineer and forest consultant. Following his practical experience in conventional Swedish forestry, he has been dedicated to the introduction of close-to-nature forestry in Scandinavia for 15 years.\n\nAugustyn Mikos is a forest policy expert at Workshop for All Beings, a Polish NGO that successfully campaigns for the protection of the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest.\n\nGabriel P\u0103un is an ecologist and works with his NGO Agent Green for the strict protection of the last remaining primary and old-growth forests in Romania and promoting forestry close to nature in the rest of the country.\n\nMatthias Schickhofer from Austria is a strategy consultant, conservationist, photographer and author. He worked for Greenpeace for 17 years and supports various NGOs in campaigns and projects.\n\nThomas Waitz from Austria is a Member of the European Parliament and co-chair of the European Green Party.

Hood National Forest outside Zigzag, Ore. Rick Bowmer/Associated Press, file\n\nBILLINGS, Mont. -- The Biden administration is advancing its plan to restrict logging within old growth forests that are increasingly threatened by climate change, with exceptions that include cutting trees to make forests less susceptible to wildfires, according to a U.S. government analysis obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nThe analysis -- expected to be published Friday -- shows that officials intend to reject a blanket prohibition on old growth logging that's long been sought by some environmentalists. Officials concluded that such a sweeping ban would make it harder to thin forests to better protect communities against wildfires that have grown more severe as the planet warms.\n\n\"To ensure the longevity of old growth forests, we're going to have to take proactive management to protect against wildfire and insects and disease,\" Forest Service Deputy Chief Chris French told AP in an interview. Without some thinning allowed on these forests, he said there is a risk of losing more trees.\n\nThe exceptions under which logging would be allowed are unlikely to placate timber industry representatives and Republicans in Congress. They've pushed back against any new restrictions. French asserted the impacts on timber companies would be minimal.\n\n\"There's so little timber sales that occur right now in old growth...that the overall effects are very small,\" French said.\n\nThe proposed changes mark a shift within an agency that historically promoted logging. They're expected to be finalized before President Joe Biden's first term ends in January and come after the Democrat issued a 2022 executive order that directed the U.S. Department of Agriculture to identify old growth forests across the nation and devise ways to conserve them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat order touched off a flurry of disagreement over what fits under the definition of old growth and how those trees should be managed.\n\nOld-growth forests, such as the storied giant sequoia stands of northern California, have layer upon layer of undisturbed trees and vegetation. There's wide consensus on the importance of preserving them -- both symbolically as marvels of nature, and more practically because their trunks and branches store large amounts of carbon that can be released when forests burn, adding to climate change.\n\nUnderlining the urgency of the issue are wildfires that killed thousands of giant sequoias in recent years. The towering giants are concentrated in about 70 groves scattered along the western side of the Sierra Nevada range.\n\nMost old growth forests across the U.S. were lost to logging as the nation developed over the past few centuries. Yet pockets of ancient trees remain, scattered across the U.S. including in California, the Pacific Northwest and areas of the Rocky Mountains. Larger expanses of old growth survive in Alaska, such as within the Tongass National Forest.\n\nOld growth timber harvests in the Tongass were limited in 2021 to only small commercial sales. Those would no longer occur under the administration's proposal.\n\nThe new analysis follows a separate report on threats to old growth forests that was finalized last week.

Today the Biden-Harris Administration is taking new steps to conserve, restore, and expand our nation's old growth forests by advancing a proposal from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s Forest Service to amend all 128 forest land management plans to better steward old-growth forests across the entire National Forest System.\n\nAmerica's forests are a key climate solution, absorbing carbon dioxide equivalent to more than 10 percent of U.S. annual greenhouse gas emissions. USDA's National Forest Plan Amendment proposes a consistent framework to guide conservation and restoration of old-growth forest conditions across all national forests. This framework will also help to ensure that our nation's forests remain resilient to increasing threats from climate change.\n\nThe proposed amendment will use the best available science, including Indigenous Knowledge, to drive management strategies that conserve, restore, and cultivate old-growth forest conditions across our national forests. The preferred alternative outlined in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement released today sets protections for existing old growth, outlines proactive stewardship and science-based management steps to reduce the threat of old-growth mortality from catastrophic wildfire, and would require a locally-informed adaptive management strategy to be developed within two years of a final decision.\n\nThe Forest Service and the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management (BLM) together manage approximately 32 million acres of old-growth and 80 million acres of mature forests on federal lands, for a total of 112 million acres. Old-growth forests represent 18 percent and mature forest another 45 percent of all forested land managed by the two agencies. Next week Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy John Podesta will share today's progress with the world and speak about the role that forests play in combatting the climate crisis at the Oslo Tropical Forest Forum in Norway.\n\nPresident Biden's Executive Order on Strengthening the Nation's Forests, Communities, and Local Economies and the Biden-Harris Administration's whole-of-government approach are furthering efforts to safeguard and steward our nation's forests, including through $50 million from the Inflation Reduction Act and the President's Investing in America agenda to support old-growth conservation.\n\nOther recent progress to conserve and restore our nation's forests and expand access to outdoor space for communities include:\n\nMature and Old-Growth Threats Analysis: Last week the Forest Service issued a final Mature and Old Growth Threats Analysis which identified wildfire, exacerbated by climate change and fire exclusion, as the leading threat to mature and old-growth forests. This was followed by insects and disease in the West, while more varied disturbances threaten older forests in Alaska and in eastern regions. The analysis also found that two-thirds of mature forests and just over half of old-growth forests are vulnerable to these threats. Tree cutting (any removal of trees) is currently a relatively minor threat despite having been a major disturbance historically, as from 1950 to 1990 these practices were the primary reason for loss of old-growth forests. The threats analysis suggests that current land management activities may not be sufficiently responsive to rapidly changing disturbances and conditions that affect mature and old-growth forest conditions, showing the need for an updated nationwide plan.\n\nInterim Forest Service Project Review: To ensure consistency in old-growth management as the nationwide plan amendment process progresses, last December the Forest Service issued an interim policy outlined in more detail in a letter from the deputy chief of the National Forest System to regional foresters. Under the interim policy the deputy chief of the Forest Service has reviewed over 90 projects to ensure consistency with the proposed action. Additional projects are pending review.\n\nShowcasing Forest Conservation Projects: The Biden-Harris Administration released a beta version of the American Conservation and Stewardship Atlas, an innovative tool that offers users the ability to view a wide range of scientific information, data, and knowledge on biodiversity, climate change impacts, and equity, with the goal of helping inform and inspire land, water, and wildlife conservation and restoration efforts of individuals, land managers, policymakers, and communities. The Atlas showcases investments in forest health, urban and community forestry grant projects, and other resilience and restoration investments.\n\nBLM Public Lands Rule: In April, the BLM finalized the Public Lands Rule to help guide the balanced management of America's public lands and steward healthy landscapes. The final rule supports the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to ensure forests continue to deliver clean water, clean air, and sustainable wildlife habitat.\n\nUrban and Community Forestry Inflation Reduction Act Grants: With urban forests making up 20 percent of all forests in the United States, urban trees are essential to helping communities access nature and reducing the impacts of climate change. USDA's Urban and Community Forestry Program is the only federal program dedicated to the nation's urban forest resources, reaching more than 140 million acres of urban and community forests across the United States. Through funding from President Biden's Investing in America agenda, nearly $1.4 billion has been awarded to support urban tree-planting and management in communities across the country.", "source": {"uri": "whitehouse.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "The White House"}, "authors": [{"uri": "white_house@whitehouse.gov", "name": "White House", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_forest_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National forest (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old-growth_forest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Old-growth forest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservation biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewardship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stewardship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Forest_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Forest Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_potential", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Global warming potential"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Environmental impact statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Land management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_Reduction_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation Reduction Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adaptive management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Podesta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Podesta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_lands", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal lands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Organizations", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "wgt": 52}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Forestry", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Forests_and_Rainforests", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Forests and Rainforests", "wgt": 60}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/wh_social-share.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668806", "eventUri": "eng-9668806", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- The Biden administration is advancing its plan to restrict logging within old growth forests that are increasingly threatened by climate change, with exceptions that include cutting trees to make forests less susceptible to wildfires, according to a U.S. government analysis obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nThe analysis -- expected to be published Friday -- shows that officials intend to reject a blanket prohibition on old growth logging that's long been sought by some environmentalists. Officials concluded that such a sweeping ban would make it harder to thin forests to better protect communities against wildfires that have grown more severe as the planet warms.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Without some thinning allowed on these forests, he said there is a risk of losing more trees.\n\nThe exceptions under which logging would be allowed are unlikely to placate timber industry representatives and Republicans in Congress. They've pushed back against any new restrictions. French asserted the impacts on timber companies would be minimal.\n\n\"There's so little timber sales that occur right now in old growth...that the overall effects are very small,\" French said.\n\nThe proposed changes mark a shift within an agency that historically promoted logging. They're expected to be finalized before President Joe Biden's first term ends in January and come after the Democrat issued a 2022 executive order that directed the U.S. Department of Agriculture to identify old growth forests across the nation and devise ways to conserve them.\n\nThat order touched off a flurry of disagreement over what fits under the definition of old growth and how those trees should be managed.\n\nOld-growth forests, such as the storied giant sequoia stands of northern California, have layer upon layer of undisturbed trees and vegetation. There's wide consensus on the importance of preserving them -- both symbolically as marvels of nature, and more practically because their trunks and branches store large amounts of carbon that can be released when forests burn, adding to climate change.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nUnderlining the urgency of the issue are wildfires that killed thousands of giant sequoias in recent years. The towering giants are concentrated in about 70 groves scattered along the western side of the Sierra Nevada range.\n\nMost old growth forests across the U.S. were lost to logging as the nation developed over the past few centuries. Yet pockets of ancient trees remain, scattered across the U.S. including in California, the Pacific Northwest and areas of the Rocky Mountains. Larger expanses of old growth survive in Alaska, such as within the Tongass National Forest.\n\nOld growth timber harvests in the Tongass were limited in 2021 to only small commercial sales. Those would no longer occur under the administration's proposal.\n\nThe new analysis follows a separate report on threats to old growth forests that was finalized last week. It concluded wildfire, insects and disease have been the main killers of old growth trees since 2000, accounting for almost 1,400 square miles losses (3,600 square kilometers).\n\nBy contrast, logging on federal lands cut down about about 14 square miles of old growth (36 square kilometers). That figure has been seized on by timber industry representatives who argue further restrictions aren't needed.\n\n\"Most forest plans already restrict harvest in old growth stands,\" said Bill Imbergamo with the Federal Forest Resource Coalition, an industry group. \"A binding restriction on timber harvest is not where their priority ought to be.\"\n\nEnvironmentalists have urged the administration to go even further as they seek to stop logging projects on federal lands in Oregon, South Dakota, Montana, Idaho and other states.\n\nJamie Williams, president of The Wilderness Society, said the proposal was \"a step in the right direction.\"\n\n\"But it must go further to protect and restore resilient old-growth forests in a way that meets the challenges of the changing climate,\" he added.\n\nUnder former President Donald Trump, federal officials sought to open up millions of acres of West Coast forests to potential logging. Federal wildlife officials reversed the move in 2021 after determining political appointees under Trump relied on faulty science to justify drastically shrinking areas of forest that are considered crucial habitats for the imperiled northern spotted owl.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The proposed amendment will be available tomorrow in the Federal Register, and will be open for public comment for 90 days following publication.\n\nThe purpose of this amendment is to provide consistent guidance for the stewardship, conservation, and recruitment of old growth across national forests. The proposed amendment highlights the importance of proactive stewardship actions in managing threats to old growth forests, and to reduce wildfire risk, considering current and emerging climate-driven threats. It also calls for adaptive management strategies to be developed using local, geographically relevant information and the best available science, including Indigenous Knowledge.\n\n\"Recent scientific analysis shows us that many old-growth forests are under significant threat from climate change,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. \"The Forest Service's plan will help safeguard these iconic stands of trees through science-based management and conservation strategies that can be adapted to unique local circumstances on national forests. USDA is looking forward to receiving feedback on today's draft proposal from Tribal, state and local governments, industry partners, conservation organizations, and many others; all of whom will be critical partners in the forest management and conservation actions needed to ensure the maintenance and growth of old-growth forests into the future.\"\n\n\"Under President Biden's leadership, we are taking action to ensure that millions of acres of old growth forests across the nation are conserved, resilient, and abundant for future generations,\" said White House Council on Environmental Quality Chair Brenda Mallory. \"With our nation's forests absorbing more than 10% of our annual greenhouse gas emissions, protecting and expanding old growth is critical to delivering on the Biden-Harris Administration's climate and conservation priorities.\"\n\n\"Our old growth forests breathe in carbon pollution, cleaning up the air, and filter our water, cleaning up rivers and streams. These forests are an essential partner in tackling climate change. President Biden's historic leadership on climate - including his executive order on safeguarding our forest system - leans into that partnership and potential by advancing climate-smart forestry and investing in forest restoration,\" said Assistant to President Biden and National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi. \"Today's action will help better inform the stewardship of the national forest system and strengthen our work to deploy nature-based solutions that improve the resilience of lands, waters, wildlife, and communities.\"\n\n\"Old growth forests are important to our ecosystems by capturing carbon, and contributing to clean air, soil, water and diverse habitats,\" said Forest Service Chief Randy Moore. \"Old forests also provide other benefits like subsistence and cultural uses, outdoor recreational opportunities and sustainable local economic development. The proposed old growth amendment will provide guidance that can be adapted locally to support multiple uses, including proactive stewardship of old forests to reduce wildfire risk and create long-term resilience in a changing climate.\n\nAt President Biden's direction, the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management (BLM) completed the first-ever nationwide inventory of old and mature forests, and developed definitions for more than 200 forest types in the United States. This initial inventory report showed that the BLM and Forest Service manage approximately 32 million acres of old growth and 80 million acres of mature forests on federally managed lands, for a total of 112 million acres. Old-growth forests represent 18% and mature forest another 45% of all forested land managed by the two agencies.\n\nThe Forest Service also recently finalized The Mature and Old Growth Threat Analysis, which identifies threats to mature and old growth forests on Forest Service and BLM lands. The report informed the Forest Service's proposed national amendment and highlights the urgent need for action, suggesting current management is not responsive enough to address disturbances driven by climate change such as wildfire, insects and disease.\n\nThe Forest Service evaluated Tribal and public input from the initial scoping period, which closed February 2, 2024. Extensive feedback from a diverse range of audiences was vital in the development of the draft environmental impact statement and were incorporated into the proposed action and used to develop alternatives. The agency will continue to learn from the input and feedback received during this public comment period, as well as through ongoing Tribal roundtables and consultation sessions, and dialogue with cooperating agencies, and state and local governments.\n\nThis work is part of larger agency efforts to support healthy, resilient forests and ecosystems by integrating climate change considerations into all aspects of planning and operations to support healthy resilient forests and ecosystems. The work is consistent with the Inflation Reduction Act which directed $50 million to fund old growth conservation and stewardship as well as Executive Order 14072, Strengthening the Nation's Forests, Communities, and Local Economies, issued by President Biden on April 22, 2022. It also supports the Forest Service's Wildfire Crisis Strategy and Reforestation Strategy (PDF, 7 MB). In addition, USDA announced updates to its Climate Adaptation Plan earlier today, in concert with other agencies acting to advance climate resilience.\n\nThroughout the comment period, the Forest Service will conduct public engagements and field tours, including virtual information sessions. The agency will also continue formal consultation with Tribes, and work with state and local governments, conservation districts and other cooperating agencies. Additional information on engagement opportunities is available on the Forest Service National Old Growth Amendment website.\n\nUSDA touches the lives of all Americans each day in so many positive ways. In the Biden-Harris Administration, USDA is transforming America's food system with a greater focus on more resilient local and regional food production, fairer markets for all producers, ensuring access to safe, healthy and nutritious food in all communities, building new markets and streams of income for farmers and producers using climate smart food and forestry practices, making historic investments in infrastructure and clean energy capabilities in rural America, and committing to equity across the Department by removing systemic barriers and building a workforce more representative of America.

(AP) -- The Biden administration is advancing its plan to restrict logging within old growth forests that are increasingly threatened by climate change, with exceptions that include cutting trees to make forests less susceptible to wildfires, according to a U.S. government analysis obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nThe analysis -- expected to be published Friday -- shows that officials intend to reject a blanket prohibition on old growth logging that's long been sought by some environmentalists. Officials concluded that such a sweeping ban would make it harder to thin forests to better protect communities against wildfires that have grown more severe as the planet warms.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Without some thinning allowed on these forests, he said there is a risk of losing more trees.\n\nThe exceptions under which logging would be allowed are unlikely to placate timber industry representatives and Republicans in Congress. They've pushed back against any new restrictions. French asserted the impacts on timber companies would be minimal.\n\n\"There's so little timber sales that occur right now in old growth...that the overall effects are very small,\" French said.\n\nThe proposed changes mark a shift within an agency that historically promoted logging. They're expected to be finalized before President Joe Biden's first term ends in January and come after the Democrat issued a 2022 executive order that directed the U.S. Department of Agriculture to identify old growth forests across the nation and devise ways to conserve them.\n\nThat order touched off a flurry of disagreement over what fits under the definition of old growth and how those trees should be managed.\n\nOld-growth forests, such as the storied giant sequoia stands of northern California, have layer upon layer of undisturbed trees and vegetation. There's wide consensus on the importance of preserving them -- both symbolically as marvels of nature, and more practically because their trunks and branches store large amounts of carbon that can be released when forests burn, adding to climate change.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nUnderlining the urgency of the issue are wildfires that killed thousands of giant sequoias in recent years. The towering giants are concentrated in about 70 groves scattered along the western side of the Sierra Nevada range.\n\nMost old growth forests across the U.S. were lost to logging as the nation developed over the past few centuries. Yet pockets of ancient trees remain, scattered across the U.S. including in California, the Pacific Northwest and areas of the Rocky Mountains. Larger expanses of old growth survive in Alaska, such as within the Tongass National Forest.\n\nOld growth timber harvests in the Tongass were limited in 2021 to only small commercial sales. Those would no longer occur under the administration's proposal.\n\nThe new analysis follows a separate report on threats to old growth forests that was finalized last week. It concluded wildfire, insects and disease have been the main killers of old growth trees since 2000, accounting for almost 1,400 square miles losses (3,600 square kilometers).\n\nBy contrast, logging on federal lands cut down about about 14 square miles of old growth (36 square kilometers). That figure has been seized on by timber industry representatives who argue further restrictions aren't needed.\n\n\"Most forest plans already restrict harvest in old growth stands,\" said Bill Imbergamo with the Federal Forest Resource Coalition, an industry group. \"A binding restriction on timber harvest is not where their priority ought to be.\"\n\nEnvironmentalists have urged the administration to go even further as they seek to stop logging projects on federal lands in Oregon, South Dakota, Montana, Idaho and other states.\n\nJamie Williams, president of The Wilderness Society, said the proposal was \"a step in the right direction.\"\n\n\"But it must go further to protect and restore resilient old-growth forests in a way that meets the challenges of the changing climate,\" he added.\n\nUnder former President Donald Trump, federal officials sought to open up millions of acres of West Coast forests to potential logging. Federal wildlife officials reversed the move in 2021 after determining political appointees under Trump relied on faulty science to justify drastically shrinking areas of forest that are considered crucial habitats for the imperiled northern spotted owl.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Taylor Griggs\n\nIt's a big year for forest conservationists in Oregon, who are using a variety of tactics -- deploying different levels of civil disobedience -- to fight against continued old growth logging around the state.\n\nOld growth forest advocates say the trees-which define the Pacific Northwest's iconic landscape-are not only beautiful, they're necessary for mitigating the worsening impacts of the climate crisis. And despite plans to preserve them, these old growth forests are at risk.\n\nAt a rally last week outside the Forest Service's Pacific Northwest regional headquarters in downtown Portland, environmental activists called attention to the United States Forest Service's objective to amend the plan that dictates management of federal forest land in the Pacific Northwest. Activists say the current plan, while instrumental in protecting the region's oldest trees during a time of mass deforestation, has loopholes allowing the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to carry out commercial logging projects in old growth forests.\n\nThe Forest Service, in accordance with a 2022 executive order from President Biden, has proposed the National Old-Growth Amendment: The \"first-of-its kind proposal to amend all 128 forest land management plans\" across the country. According to the Forest Service, the proposed amendment is \"intended to provide consistent direction to conserve and steward old-growth forest conditions in response to rapidly changing climate conditions.\"\n\nAt last week's rally, activists urged people to participate in the upcoming public engagement period for the amended plan, which will impact the region's forests for decades to come.\n\nMeanwhile, in other parts of the state, activists have staged tree-sits, taking up temporary residence in 100-foot Douglas firs on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land to protest commercial logging and forest management policies.\n\nActivists say both strategies are necessary to protect Oregon's ancient forests.\n\nIn 1994, after years of environmental protests over the degradation of the Pacific Northwest's old growth forests, the United States Forest Service adopted a landmark ecosystem protection plan. Thirty years later, the plan is set to be amended, and environmental activists see another major opportunity to preserve what's left of the Pacific Northwest's ancient forests.\n\nSince the first iteration of the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) was adopted by President Bill Clinton, there's been a paradigm shift in the environmental movement. The rallying cry during the 1980s and '90s timber protests was to save endangered species, notably the iconic Northern spotted owl, by protecting their forest ecosystems. While activists are still focused on preserving endangered species habitat, they're also much more aware of the threats of climate change and the role of forests -- especially old growth forests -- in mitigating those threats.\n\nWith the growing threat of the climate crisis in mind, President Biden issued a 2022 executive order to \"take action to conserve, restore, reforest, and manage our magnificent forests.\" At the end of last year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a proposal to carry out the goals of that executive order with the National Old-Growth Amendment, which will revise forest land management plans to \"conserve and steward old-growth forest conditions on national forests and grasslands nationwide.\"\n\n\"This really is an extraordinary time for our national forests,\" Angela Sondenaa, a certified senior ecologist and member of the NWFP federal advisory committee, said at last week's rally. \"[This is] your opportunity to have a voice, and help shape plans that will govern our national forest management for decades to come.\"\n\nSondenaa, who is a Siletz tribal member, also discussed the value trees hold in Native American communities across the region, and the importance of including tribal perspectives in the plan amendment process.\n\n\"In the original Northwest Forest Plan efforts, tribes were not included at all...[tribal] worldviews were not deemed valuable enough for the administration to consult us. In this go-around, that's different,\" she said. \"These forests are sacred to indigenous people. There's no way to separate indigenous cultures from the environment and the landscapes where they evolved.\"\n\nBrenna Bell, the forest climate manager at environmental justice group 350 PDX, pointed out at the rally that \"timber production is still the primary value for most forest management in the Northwest.\"\n\n\"Even the areas that have some degree of protection have loopholes,\" Bell said. \"There's logging in late-successional reserves and in riparian reserves, often under the guise of fire prevention or forest health.\"\n\nWhile forest management agencies have long maintained logging is necessary for forest fire prevention, tree conservationists disagree -- and science backs them up. The timber industry, which remains widely influential across the region, has a vested interest in promoting logging as an environmentally sustainable decision. However, studies have shown that logging is not effective at reducing forest fires, and old growth forests are, in fact, often more resilient to fire.\n\nIn a letter to the Biden administration and the Forest Service, signed by 70 environmental organizations from across the country, activists urged leaders to close the logging loopholes. The letter calls on Biden to issue a new executive order \"establishing an immediate moratorium on logging old growth forests until such a time as permanent and legally binding protections for these forests are in place.\"\n\n\"Brave leadership is needed to enact a paradigm shift for federal forest management that prioritizes biodiversity, clean cold water, carbon storage, connectivity and core habitats for wildlife, and unfragmented forests,\" the letter says. \"It is long past time to move away from outdated strategies of large scale resource extraction on federal public lands. Such changes are needed to avert the worst of the climate crisis, as well as for ensuring clean drinking water and livable communities.\"\n\nThe letter also asks the Biden administration to ensure the Forest Service and BLM recognize logging as a threat to old growth forests and reduce or eliminate their annual timber harvest quotas, which activists say leads to excessive and unnecessary logging.\n\nActivists say you don't have to look very far to see examples of the Forest Service and BLM taking advantage of the NWFP's loopholes. And as some environmentalists pen letters to the president, others have staked a place in the trees.\n\nEarlier this month, protesters began a tree-sit action at the BLM's Rogue Gold Forest Management Project in southern Oregon, with activists perched in old growth trees hundreds of feet in the air. The protesters say mature and old growth trees in the Rogue Gold area are \"threatened by the BLM's practice of utilizing roadbuilding loopholes to aggressively log threatened ecosystems across Oregon.\"\n\nThis is the second tree-sit in southern Oregon in the last several months. Protesters occupied the BLM's Poor Windy Timber Sale in April, and claimed victory after the agency agreed to preserve a section of old-growth forest from an approved logging project.\n\n\"BLM logging projects like Poor Windy and Rogue Gold are targeting some of the last remaining stands of old, carbon-rich trees that are left in Oregon,\" protest organizer Sam Shields said in a press release. \"Cutting down trees does not make forests more resilient to fire, as the BLM wants us to believe, but actually has the opposite effect - increasing wildfire risk, endangering our communities and driving the climate crisis.\"\n\nIn an interview with Oregon Public Broadcasting, Shields said \"it's more clear than ever that taking direct action...is an effective strategy for protecting these forests,\" and called this period a \"renaissance\" for tree-sitting. The tactic was popularized during the timber protests of 30 years ago, with tree-sitting pioneers staking out spots in the Willamette National Forest to protect Northern spotted owl ecosystems.\n\nBack in Portland, forest advocates say it's okay if you're afraid of heights -- there are other ways to make a difference.\n\n\"I really implore you to use your voice. Use your power as citizens of a free and open democracy to get engaged in these public processes, and tell your elected officials, your public servants, how you want your forests and your national lands managed,\" Sondenaa said at last week's rally. \"Because it matters. It matters to the wildlife, the waters, the air, all of us.\"\n\nBell echoed Sondenaa's words, urging people to keep up their activism even if it feels inconsequential in the face of the climate crisis.\n\n\"Sometimes the scale of changes that we're facing make any action we take too little and too late. But to each tree that's still standing in the forest, our action can make a difference,\" Bell said. \"For those trees, our actions are not too little too late. Protecting the old growth isn't going to change everything. But for the lives of those trees, it will change everything.\"", "source": {"uri": "portlandmercury.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Portland Mercury"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old-growth_forest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Old-growth forest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Land_Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Land Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Forest_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Forest Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logging", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Logging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Environmental movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Northwest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_forest_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National forest (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Climate crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservation movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Land management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Forest management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Endangered species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Forest_Plan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northwest Forest Plan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_fir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Douglas fir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disobedience", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil disobedience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lumber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deforestation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willamette_National_Forest", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Willamette National Forest"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern Oregon"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Forestry", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Forests_and_Rainforests", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Forests and Rainforests", "wgt": 57}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Death_Care/Memorials", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Death Care/Memorials", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://media2.fdncms.com/portmerc/imager/u/large/47266845/img_5583.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668806", "eventUri": "eng-9668806", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

But even when burned, old-growth forests offer rich growing conditions. (Stuart Isett for Hakai Magazine)\n\nBut the forest floor is speckled with green, and Laughlin points out some of the same species that appeared at the previous site -- such as pearly everlasting and fireweed, a pink-blossomed spiky plant named for its tendency to sprout after a burn. Harvey spots beargrass -- not grass at all but a mountain flower that ranges along the West Coast (also used by Indigenous communities in California for making baskets and regalia, according to Royale Williams, an undergraduate researcher with Harvey's lab who has Karuk heritage). Above them stands one partly alive old Douglas fir -- whose bark was thick enough to offer it a modicum of protection -- and a noble fir, which was probably just lucky. At shin height, a group of little seedlings cluster together. Laughlin crouches down and wags their stems affectionately -- silver fir, noble fir, Douglas fir, hemlock.\n\nIt's a surprising gathering of seedlings, she explains. Typically, botanists think of noble and Douglas firs as trees that prefer sunlight and exposure, and hemlock and silver fir as shade dwellers -- sprouting after other trees and plants have given them some cover. But Laughlin, Harvey and the rest of their research crew have found something unexpected in their old-growth plots post-fire. \"Both of these players are establishing at the same time,\" says Laughlin. The old-growth forests simply have more ingredients to start with, \"more seeds on the menu,\" explains Harvey.\n\nIn other words, even after a severe fire, an old-growth forest is better able to recover than an area that has been logged.\n\nMoreover, as scorched as this place looks, even the deadwood that remains has a purpose. About 80 to 90 percent of the woody carbon is still here, Harvey says. \"Like there's downed logs that were on the forest floor that didn't get consumed,\" he points out. \"There's trees that were alive or dead at the time of the fire that are still standing.\" Old-growth forests bank their carbon in various places.\n\nAll these factors make old-growth forests more resilient and more important than younger ones in the face of climate change.\n\nLess than 30 percent of the old-growth forests in the U.S. Pacific Northwest are still standing. On the Canadian side, losses may be even greater. Less than 20 percent of British Columbia's forests are old growth, according to the provincial government, but perhaps as little as one percent is highly productive old growth, according to a recent analysis by three independent researchers.\n\nSo when forest fires arrive in the Pacific Northwest, they are often burning through second growth, sometimes in an industrial landscape -- a plantation that may be full of trees that are densely stocked, about the same age, and, on the U.S. side of the border, belonging to a handful of species, especially the commercially valuable Douglas fir. Younger trees have thinner bark and are less likely to live through a burn than their elders. Sometimes commercial foresters even use herbicides to prevent plants and shrubs from growing alongside the timber. This strategy is supposed to give trees unfettered access to nutrients, water, light and space without competition from other plants, but in reality it stops the formation of an understory that can protect the trees by gathering moisture on the forest floor. Some experts say that plantation forests managed this way are less resilient to fire and other risks.\n\n\"We kind of set up our landscape for vulnerability by a lot of clearcutting and conversion of primary forests to planted forests, weeding out the broadleaf species [those found in the rainforest's understory], which are the most fire-resistant species. We are creating a more uniform landscape for fire to funnel through,\" says forest ecologist Suzanne Simard from the University of British Columbia. (Simard is famous for proposing that trees may intelligently trade resources with one another through underground fungal networks, an idea that inspired the blockbuster movie Avatar and the bestselling novel The Overstory.) A focus of her work now is developing sustainable forestry practices that protect the workings of the forest ecosystem -- including carbon storage.\n\nSimard says conserving old-growth forests is one of the most important climate-protection steps British Columbia can take. \"It's taken thousands of years to build that forest floor, and we lose 60 percent [of the carbon] right away with logging,\" she says. \"It just is crazy to think that we're actually still doing this in this time when we've got to be going to net-zero [carbon].\"\n\nThis also means that commercial foresters should be managing their trees more like old-growth forests.\n\nMichael Case and some of his colleagues at The Nature Conservancy have been experimenting with a formerly logged swath of coastal forest in Washington to see what that might look like. In areas planted with a monoculture of Douglas fir, they are thinning back some of the trees and planting species like Western red cedar (not favored by timber companies in Washington because it grows too slowly). Their restoration work has also allowed some understory plants to reestablish, like huckleberry and cascara, the latter a slender shrub whose leaves, flowers and berries feed a multitude of birds, insects and mammals. Over about two decades, these restored forests have started to look more complex and multigenerational than before, more like old growth. Case hopes to show that it's possible here to grow an old-growth-ish forest that's also profitable. \"The model that we're trying to showcase here is one in which you don't have to clearcut to make it viable. There can be an element of thinning, of having longer rotations,\" he says.\n\nAt his forest plots, Brian Harvey tries not to read hope or doom or other foregone conclusions into the landscape. But what he has found so far has important implications for anyone in search of a forest-making recipe.\n\nThe final place he brings his scientists to on that sunny July day is formerly logged forest -- completely burned over. They clamber down from the road into a patch of spindly black tree stems, their branches curled inward. The trees here were shorter, so the fire scorched them top to bottom -- killing all. On the ground are fewer seedlings. \"We're seeing the lowest relative abundance of seedlings in these young-tree fire stands,\" says Laughlin. There is also far less carbon here than in the burned old growth, probably because it began with less -- no big, old trees.\n\nIt is not a lifeless place. Laughlin points to stems of willow and dwarf bramble (which looks like a petite raspberry) creeping along the ground. She and one of her colleagues also hover over one noble fir seedling and try to count nodes on the stem that would tell them how old it is. It looks like a four-year-old to Laughlin, which means it sprouted just a couple of years after the fire. But overall, it will be harder for this forest to grow back. It has fewer ingredients than its old-growth counterpart. Like other burned second growth, it may also be more vulnerable to reburning.", "source": {"uri": "crosscut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crosscut"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abies_procera", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abies procera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_floor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forest floor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abies_alba", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abies alba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_fir", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Douglas fir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old-growth_forest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Old-growth forest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsuga", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tsuga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seedling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seedling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Northwest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bark_(botany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bark (botany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainforest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rainforest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carbon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Understory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botany", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Botany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaceae", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poaceae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plantation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_British_Columbia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of British Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Horticulture", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Horticulture", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Forestry", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Forests_and_Rainforests", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Forests and Rainforests", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Death_Care/Memorials", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Death Care/Memorials", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://crosscut.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_2000x2000/public/uploads/2024/06/group-coastal-rainforests-and-fire.jpg?itok=mJ6nEJet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668806", "eventUri": "eng-9668806", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

In the Pacific Northwest, barely one-quarter of old-growth conifers remain, and in parts of the East that number is even less. Recent studies have confirmed the unparalleled ability of mature and old-growth trees to absorb and store carbon pollution, which generally increases as they age, making these forests one of our best nature-based climate solutions.\n\nThe release of the DEIS kicks off a 90-day comment period, during which the public is encouraged to provide input on the draft plan.\n\nIn response, Sierra Club Forest Campaign Manager Alex Craven released the following statement:\n\n\"President Biden made a commitment to protect mature and old-growth forests in the United States, and today's announcement gets us one step closer to achieving that. Conserving what remains of our oldest forests is undoubtedly a positive step towards climate action. We look forward to engaging in this process to ensure the amendment not only retains, but increases, the amount of old-growth forests across the country. Shifting our approach to national forests from resources meant for extraction to natural wonders worth preserving is long overdue.\"", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Common Dreams"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old-growth_forest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Old-growth forest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Forest_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Forest Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_forest_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National forest (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conifer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_lands", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal lands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Northwest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Forestry", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Forestry", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Forests_and_Rainforests", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Forests and Rainforests", "wgt": 42}], "image": "https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8zMjEwMDM4OS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0OTE0ODI1N30.nWE-dO3LpGCfrP6HKKrgMGYA-9xT8aazabGiQTfcsrM/image.png?width=210", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668806", "eventUri": "eng-9668806", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

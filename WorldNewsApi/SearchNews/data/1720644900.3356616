{"id": 231294198, "title": "Andrew Walker Teases Three Wise Men and a Baby Sequel: &#39;Like a James Bond Christmas Movie&#39; (Exclusive)", "text": "Andrew Walker has a little gift for Hallmark Channel Christmas movie fans: some details about Three Wiser Men and a Boy. The 44-year-old actor tells PEOPLE he believes the follow-up to the 2022 film Three Wise Men and a Baby \"is going to be better than the first one,\" and hints that the sequel will be action-packed. \"It's basically like a James Bond Christmas movie. It's so ambitious. We take the viewers to so many different locations,\" he says. Walker also promises plenty of dancing. Fans of the 2022 film will likely remember that Walker and costars Tyler Hynes and Paul Campbell did an epic dance routine that went viral. The trio later surprised Christmas Con attendees with a live performance of the cheeky dance at the event. \"You're going to get a few of the fun dances and potentially some songs that we did in the first movie, so there's a bit of the old, a lot of new, and the jokes and the heart of the movie is just ... it's amazing,\" Walker reveals of the sequel, adding, \"I feel like it's a funnier \u2014 almost in different ways \u2014 more heartfelt movie.\" Walker, who has starred in more than 25 Hallmark movies over the past decade, says he embraced the rare chance to \"step back into the shoes of a character\" he's played.

He says the cast and crew felt the pressure at times throughout the production process. \"I'll tell you, it was a mountain. It wasn't easy, that's for sure. It was not an easy feat. We were going into this, we all had high expectations of this sequel and of ourselves, and we don't want to let the fans down,\" he tells PEOPLE. \"I think it was just a lot of pressure and it was a lot of us not feeling the pressure, but just we were problem solving,\" he continues, explaining that it became a wonderful, collaborative effort. \"Every minute between every scene, we would huddle and talk through it, and it was basically the funniest joke wins. We would just tell each other, 'Okay, what about this?' and 'What if I try that?' and 'What if you do this over here and come into the scene saying this?' \" He adds, \"It was like we were just supporting each other and making sure that we were just super honest with how we approach everything.\" Hallmark announced the sequel in April, sharing at the time that the movie was in production and set to premiere as part of the network's 15th annual Countdown to Christmas programming. In addition to Walker, Hynes and Campbell \u2014 who play brothers Luke, Taylor and Stephan Brenner, respectively \u2014 Margaret Colin is reprising her role as their mother, Barbara.

Jennifer Kramer, vice president of development at Hallmark Media, said in a statement that the sequel was prompted by the overwhelming success of the first film, which became an instant fan-favorite and the No. 1 most-watched original cable movie of 2022. \u201cThe one resounding thing we heard from them was that they wanted more,\u201d Kramer said of Hallmark viewers. \u201cWe are excited to deliver and then some with a story that is filled with more humor and, most importantly, more heart.\u201d", "summary": "The actor will reprise his role in the follow-up to the 2022 Hallmark Channel holiday film alongside Tyler Hynes and Paul Campbell", "url": "https://people.com/hallmark-andrew-walker-teases-three-wise-men-and-a-baby-sequel-exclusive-8659993", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/AdSmrq0PiJi8Pacm0swMx8zmWfo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(368x242:370x244)/Andrew-Walker-attends-a-screening-of-Hallmark-Channel-Christmas-at-Holly-Lodge-Three-Wise-Men-and-a-baby-060724-54cb76328", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:00:00", "author": "Breanne L.

While Berger won it twice, 1991 and 2000, Stores won it in 1992.\n\nFor Lagos fans, it will be a reprieve to see another club flying the flag on the national scene. While for Jos fans, it will be historic to have the cup back from where it took off.\n\nCommenting of the all-important top of the table clash, MFM spokesman, Olawale Quadri, told NAN that the match would definitely be a decider for both teams.\n\nQuadri said: \"Sunday's match will be explosive and a decider for both teams. Any team that wins in Jos will definitely be crowned champions, there are no two ways to this.\n\n\"For MFM, we are battle-ready for the game and we are taking it as the game of our lives. We expect fireworks from both teams and it is match everybody is looking up to.\n\n\"The match on Sunday is like the final game of the season to determine the 2016/2017 league winners. We are both locked up in a battle of wits in the race.\n\n\"It may also be a win-win situation for both clubs towards our aspiration, picking maximum points on Sunday means that we are a step closer to winning the league.''\n\nQuadri said that MFM would bank on the support of the Jos fans for a victory against the Plateau United.\n\nHe said: \"We have a good fans base in Jos and we have been mobilising them for support. We want to win the game and we want them to get behind us.\n\n\"Winning the league means a lot to everybody, the management of the club, the coach, players and fans as well.''\n\nAlthough, the Coach of Plateau United, Kennedy Boboye, could not be reached to comment on their readiness for the encounter, feelers from Jos indicate that the team and their fans are hungry to return the league crown to the city on Plateau.", "timeCrawl": "18:23:00", "sim": 0.8078431487083435, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8678786", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "id": 36, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "id": 47, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "id": 597, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Three points separate the two teams with five games to go in the season. While Plateau went away and collected a point off Kano Pillars, MFM had to settle for a home point against Enyimba.\n\nA win for Plateau would move them closer to a title that has been sought for 33 years while a win for MFM would mean they move closer to a first title in just their second season in the top flight.\n\nPlateau United have won 15 of 16 home matches thus far while MFM have lost in 11 of their 16 away outings - a pair of stats that points to a Plateau win with MFM without their top scorer, Thompson Odey and influential winger, Sikiru Olatunbosun.\n\nManchester United v West Ham @Old Trafford @4pm on Aug.13\n\nNo matter how this is played, Jose Mourinho wants an opening day victory at Old Trafford to say a bye-bye to last season's stats in which his team drew 10 of its home encounters.\n\nMany pundits have posited that West Ham manager, Slaven Bilic, would be one of the managers to lose their jobs in the new season. And like Mourinho said after the 2-1 loss to Real Madrid last Tuesday - not many teams will have the quality of the European champions - definitely not the Hammers.\n\nThis match also sees the return of Javier Hernandez, otherwise known as Chicarito, whom Mourinho said he would not have sold as manager of the Red Devils. Whether he would be able to add to the 37 league goals he scored across five seasons at the Old Trafford side remains to be seen.\n\nThe home-based Super Eagles will be facing the Squirrels of Benin Republic on Sunday in the first leg of a CHAN qualifier.\n\nOne advantage for the Eagles is that the Squirrels have not scored more than one goal in their last five matches as they had to overcame Togo on penalties after their second leg encounter ended 1-1.\n\nEven though the Eagles lost their last match - the home-based side should be stronger than many on the continent because of the relative strength of the Nigeria Professional Football League.\n\nThe \u00a3189 million has been paid and the papers filled - Neymar should make his debut on Sunday away to Guingamp, in what could be a tricky encounter for the cash-rich Parisians. PSG lost at the tiny Brittany side last season and their manager, Antoine Kombouare, has said it would be a greater victory with Neymar present.\n\n\"Honestly, it will be better if he's there. Much better, I think. Beating PSG with Neymar would be even more resounding. It will certainly be more difficult, but we love a challenge.

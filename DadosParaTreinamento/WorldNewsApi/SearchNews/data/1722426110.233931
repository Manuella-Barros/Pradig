{"id": 243285530, "title": "Jose Iglesias performs 'OMG' live at Citi Field after Mets win in unreal scene", "text": "Jose Iglesias came in as a defensive substitute because of his skillful glove work in the eighth inning of the Mets\u2019 win on Friday night. He took the field after the game to show off a completely different set of skills in a you-had-to-see-it-to-believe-it scene. The 34-year-old journeyman infielder \u2014 also known by his stage name \u201cCandelita\u201d \u2014 took a microphone after the 7-2 win over the Astros to sing his original song \u201cOMG\u201d to the delight of his teammates and fans who remained in the Citi Field stands. Iglesias, hitting .389 since joining the big league Mets in May, belted out the tune with Mets players \u2014 and at least one background dancer \u2014 around him on the infield, with Pete Alonso donning an \u201cOMG\u201d shirt. During the win Friday, the Mets even carried an \u201cOMG\u201d sign in the dugout, which was most noticeable when Jeff McNeil carried it and grinned widely after swatting a three-run homer in the bottom of the sixth to extend a lead over Houston. Iglesias first introduced the song he wrote to his Mets teammates when he was called up from Triple-A Syracuse, and it quickly became a hit among the Amazin\u2019s \u2014 with players admittedly signing the tune that he\u2019s been using as a walk-up song. During the Mets\u2019 hot streak in June that\u2019s now put them over .500, the Latin pop song has caught fire, and Citi Field has even used the tune when the team has homered. On Thursday at an event inside the ballpark during the Mets\u2019 off day, Iglesias performed the song, with a number of Mets players joining him in a delirious scene. One day later, the official music dropped on YouTube, with it already garnering more than 13,000 views in just seven hours. Iglesias took a step further after the game, performing it live to thousands of people in his home ballpark \u2014 and to those watching on the Apple TV+ broadcast \u2014 in a joyful mini concert that felt almost unreal.", "summary": "Jose Iglesias took the field after the Mets game to show off a completely different set of skills in a you-had-to-see-it-to-believe-it scene.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/28/sports/jose-iglesias-performs-omg-live-at-citi-field-after-mets-win/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/iglesias-main-1-cw.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 03:25:05", "author": "Andrew Battifarano", "authors": ["Andrew Battifarano"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.335}

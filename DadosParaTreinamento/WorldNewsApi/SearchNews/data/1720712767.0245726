Emergency crews were called to St. Anne\u2019s Anglican Church on Gladstone Avenue just before 8 a.m. The blaze, which has since been elevated to a four-alarm fire, has caused significant structural damage and destroyed much of the roof. The scene of a fire at St. Anne's Church in Toronto can be seen above. (CP24) No injuries have been reported. The church was built between 1907 and 1908, and was designated a heritage easement by the City of Toronto in 1996. According to its website, the church contains the only known religious works of art by the Group of Seven, alongside other notable paintings. In an update Sunday afternoon, Father Don Beyers, a priest at the church, told reporters that it appears the Group of Seven artwork had been destroyed. Crews are battling a fire at St. Anne's Church in Toronto on Sunday. (CP24) \u201cThis is the only church that featured artwork by members of the Group of Seven, and I\u2019m sorry to say, but that\u2019s been lost from what I can see,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026This is incredibly devastating for my congregation, it\u2019s devastating for this community, I cannot express how far-reaching [the impacts] this church fire is.\u201d Police say to expect delays in the area and use alternative routes, as Gladstone Ave is closed between College and Dundas street while crews continue to put out the fire. \u201cAt this point our focus, our primary focus, is to make sure we knock down the remaining bulk of the fire and the hotspots, that we don\u2019t allow it to spread, and the investigation will follow our normal systematic-scientific approach,\u201d Deputy Chief Jim Jessop told media. Jessop said that the investigation will begin this afternoon, however it is \u201cway too early\u201d to speculate the cause of the fire.", "summary": "Crews are battling a fire inside a downtown Toronto church that is home to a historic piece of Canadian art.", "url": "https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/downtown-toronto-church-badly-damaged-historic-artwork-destroyed-by-fire-1.6919526", "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/6/9/st--anne-s-church-fire-1-6919535-1717942565869.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 17:04:40", "author": "Brooklyn Connolly", "authors": ["Brooklyn Connolly"], "language": "en", "source_country": "CA", "sentiment": -0.398}

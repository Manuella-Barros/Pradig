{"id": 232029610, "title": "Israel kills 274 Palestinians during operation to free hostages, Hamas says", "text": "The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza claims an Israeli raid on a refugee camp that led to the rescue of four hostages killed 274 people, including civilians and children. On Saturday, Israel\u2019s forces, supported by air strikes, mounted a rescue operation in and around the Nuseirat refugee camp, resulting in intense gun battles with Hamas. Noa Argamani (26), Almog Meir Jan (22), Andrei Kozlov (27), and Shlomi Ziv (41), abducted from the Nova music festival on 7 October, have been returned to Israel. The Israeli military, however, estimates fewer than 100 people died in the operation. The contrasting figures from the Hamas-run ministry paint a grim picture, making it one of the bloodiest days in the ongoing conflict if confirmed. Residents of the densely-populated area described the terror of enduring intense bombardment and heavy gunfire. One man, Abdel Salam Darwish, recounted to the BBC his experience of hearing fighter jets and gunfire while at a market. \u201cPeople\u2019s bodies were in pieces, scattered in the streets, and blood stained the walls,\u201d he said, describing the grim aftermath. While the return of the hostages sparked celebrations in Israel and positive reactions from world leaders, including US President Joe Biden, there has also been mounting criticism of the operation\u2019s deadly toll. EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell condemned the incident \u201cin the strongest terms\u201d, stating, \u201cReports from Gaza of another massacre of civilians are appalling.\u201d An Israeli minister countered this by accusing the EU of condemning Israel for saving its citizens instead of criticising Hamas for hiding behind civilians. Al-Aqsa Hospital and al-Awda Hospital in Gaza City reported receiving a combined total of 70 bodies. The Hamas-run health ministry released the names of 86 people out of the 274 they claim were killed during the two-hour raid. Previously, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari estimated fewer than 100 casualties, calling it a \u201chigh-risk, complex mission\u201d based on \u201cprecise intelligence\u201d. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant stated that special forces operated \u201cunder heavy fire\u201d during the rescue, with one officer wounded, later dying in hospital. Hospitals in Gaza paint a dire picture, with footage from al-Aqsa Hospital showing numerous severely injured people on the blood-stained floors. The al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat reported a steady rise in fatalities on Saturday, with Dr Marwan Abu Nasser also highlighting the lack of a morgue to handle the deceased. One man, speaking to the BBC, described the loss of over 40 family members since the conflict began in October. He recounted a strike on a house filled with children and women, with only a handful of survivors. The heavy loss of life sparked a rare display of criticism towards Hamas from Gazans. Hassan Omar, 37, lamented the unnecessary deaths, suggesting that negotiating for prisoners could have achieved the same result without bloodshed. \u201cMy message to Hamas is stopping the loss is part of the gain, we should get rid of those who control us from Qatar hotels,\u201d he said. The rescued hostages were held during Hamas\u2019s 7 October attacks in southern Israel, which killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. A deal in November led to the release of 105 hostages and a temporary ceasefire in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners. As of Saturday, 116 hostages remain in Hamas custody, with 41 believed dead. The Hamas-run health ministry puts the total death toll in Gaza at 37,084.

Credit - Ashok Kumar/TAS24/Getty Images\n\nAfter a two-month hiatus, Taylor Swift returned to the stage today, embarking on the European leg of the Eras Tour. Swift performed the first of four nights in Paris, about three weeks after she released her latest album, The Tortured Poets Department.\n\nSoon after the album's release, fans were convinced Swift would add The Tortured Poets Department to the Eras Tour, based on the star's social media activity. On April 25, Swift posted a YouTube Short video of her rehearsing for the tour, in which the album's opening song \"Fortnight\" could be heard. The caption read: \"A fortnight til Paris.\"\n\nIn an interview with Radio France, Swift's French tour promoter said she would be including new songs from the album on the next leg of the Eras Tour. \"We are going to discover a slightly modified show since she has released a new album,\" he said.\n\nAs the show kicked off in Paris on Thursday evening, all signs pointed to The Tortured Poets Department's inclusion on the setlist. Fans noted that it was included in the tour intro:\n\nSwift added The Tortured Poets Department to the Eras Tour intro and reordered the setlist on the first night in Paris. The \"Lover\" portion of the show previously ended with the song \"The Archer,\" but on Thursday, Swift skipped it, going from \"Lover\" to \"Fearless.\" After the \"Fearless\" era, Swift went right into the \"Red\" era instead of \"Evermore,\" and followed that up with songs from Speak Now and Reputation. Fans noted that Swift skipped performing \"Long Live\" from Speak Now, which she added to the setlist last July.\n\nOther changes followed when Swift went into the \"Folklore\" era. While the \"Evermore\" and \"Folklore\" eras typically occurred at different parts of the show, in Paris, Swift announced she was combining them, since they are \"sister albums.\"\n\n\"On the Eras Tour, we have now reunited the sisters, combined them into one chapter. You can call it \"Folkmore,\" you can call it \"Everlore,\" she said, before performing \"Champagne Problems\" (from Evermore) followed by \"August\" (from Folklore).\n\nAccording to Pollstar, in December 2023, the Eras Tour became the highest-grossing tour of all time and the first-ever tour to gross over $1 billion.\n\nRead More: All the Song Mashups Taylor Swift Has Played During the Eras Tour\n\nSwift introduced the \"Tortured Poets\" section of the Eras Tour after a performance of \"Bad Blood,\" with the set turning into an image of a long road. She opened the new era with a performance of \"But Daddy I Love Him.\"\n\nThe second song in the \"Tortured Poets\" era was a shortened version of \"So High School,\" followed by a performance of \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?\"\n\nSwift then sang \"Down Bad,\" as an image of a UFO flew above her, before performing the album's opening track, \"Fortnight.\" The next song from Tortured Poets was \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived.\"\n\nThen, Swift changed into a gold jacket, while a jazzy tune played, before singing \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.\"\n\nBut the \"Tortured Poets\" era wasn't over. After \"Paris,\" Swift performed the melancholy \"loml,\" track 12 from the album.\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department made history as the most streamed album in a single day, accumulating over 300 million streams -- beating out the previous record holder: Beyonc\u00e9's Cowboy Carter. It also became the fastest album to amass over one billion streams in just five days, making it the most streamed album in a week with over 799 million streams. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 with 2.61 million equivalent album units (this includes vinyls, CDs, cassettes, and digital album downloads). Swift celebrated the album's success with a post to Instagram sharing photos of her and her collaborators making the project.\n\nThe caption reads, \"2.6 million ARE YOU ACTUALLY SERIOUS??

However, the tour's setlist is bound to be modified after the release of The Tortured Poets Department.\n\nMajor \"Eras\" tour setlist change\n\nThe tour promoter for Swift's stop in France dropped a bombshell regarding the \"Eras\" tour setlist (via France Info). Swift will be implementing songs from The Tortured Poets Department, which was released in the middle of her two-month break, into the setlist.\n\nHe said, \"We are going to discover a slightly modified show since she has released a new album since she stopped its Australian release.\"\n\nHe elaborated, \"So she's going to include new pieces from her new album.\"\n\nThis move puts to rest any fears that Swift wouldn't play songs from her new album on the tour. After all, this is the \"Eras\" tour. The Tortured Poets Department is a part of her latest era.\n\nWhere will the songs go?\n\nThe real question is where Swift cuts out songs. As it stands, Swift plays an average of 45 songs per show on the \"Eras\" tour. Every show has started and ended in similar fashion, with \"Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince\" opening the show and \"Karma\" closing all 83 shows thus far.\n\nIt's more likely that Swift will play The Tortured Poets Department songs at the end of the set. Before the album was released, Swift was closing out her sets with seven songs from Midnights, her latest release at that point. With The Tortured Poets Department being her latest release, perhaps she will cut out songs from the Midnights set to make space for her new album.\n\nSome of Swift's albums also get more time to shine than others. As noted, Midnights gets seven songs per night. Lover, which opens the show, gets six songs. Evermore and 1989 get five while Reputation and Red each get four songs. Folklore gets seven songs.\n\nIn addition to the regular album tracks, Swift usually leaves two slots open for surprise songs. Had she not devoted more space to The Tortured Poets Department, it's possible she could have played a couple of songs each night at this point in the show.\n\nTaylor Swift's 2024 tour\n\nTaylor Swift began the \"Eras\" tour in March 2023 with two shows in Glendale, Arizona. Swift then took the tour across North America in 2023 and also played shows in Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil.\n\nIn February 2024, Swift resumed the tour with shows in Japan, Australia, and Singapore. After a two-month break, Swift will resume the tour on May 9 with four shows in Nanterre, France. She will subsequently bring the tour across Europe before returning to North America in October.\n\nAs of the time of this writing, Swift will close out the tour with nine more shows in North America and nine shows in Canada.\n\nTo commemorate the tour, Swift released a concert film -- Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. The film was a huge hit, grossing over $260 million at the box office and becoming the highest-grossing concert film ever.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_korpan@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Andrew Korpan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midnights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americana_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Americana (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evermore_(Taylor_Swift_album)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evermore (Taylor Swift album)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore_(Taylor_Swift_album)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Folklore (Taylor Swift album)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Concert film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glendale,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glendale, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glendale, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanterre", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nanterre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nanterre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Touring", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Touring", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Spirit/Fight_Songs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Spirit/Fight Songs", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events_and_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events and Shows", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Taylor-Swift-makes-major-Eras-tour-setlist-change-after-Tortured-Poets-Department.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546454", "eventUri": "eng-9546454", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 2464, "textEnd": 2469}], "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Will she sing the TTPD album during her The Eras Tour 2024? There is a huge suspense building around Taylor Swift's Eras Tour in Paris as she arrived in Europe for her gigs across venues in Paris and other European cities.\n\nSince her last Eras Tour show, Swift has released a whopping 31 songs from The Tortured Poets Department album, which is seeing fans going 'gaga' over the look and feel of the entire setlist.\n\nSwift initiates the European leg of her tour on Thursday, May 9, starting in Paris. Additionally, she will grace the stage on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights in the City of Light.\n\nThere are a total of 69 shows remaining on the Eras Tour: 51 in Europe, nine in America, and nine in Canada.\n\nAs her Europe tour kicks off tonight in Paris, Swift, who has earlier been seen a select number of songs from her previous albums, may lend her voice to some of the recently launched TTPD songs, according to The UK Standard report.\n\nSwifties are expecting some of the TTPD songs in tonight's concert but are still unsure which songs she may sing ultimately. For that, we will need to wait till the Paris tour show commences.\n\nHowever, if we go by the popularity of the TTPD songs, Fortnight, I Can Do It With a Broken Heart, Down Bad, and So Long, London, has been the most streamed on Spotify and it is highly expected that some of these songs may feature on her setlist, says The UK Standard.\n\nTaylor Swift may drop some surprise bombs on fans which may include Picture to Burn, Mr Perfectly Fine, Speak Now, Mean, and others, that may feature on her setlist, according to reports.\n\nSwift's shows in Europe and North America are entirely sold out. While there are tickets available on resale sites, caution is advised to avoid scams. The safest approach is to regularly monitor the links provided on Swift's website, where some tickets are available for resale through verified channels approved by her team.\n\nTaylor Swift has released which album recently?\n\nTaylor Swift, one of the most popular music stars globally, has recently dropped 31 songs from The Tortured Poets Department album.\n\nWhat are some of the albums Taylor Swift has sung in Eras Tour concerts earlier?\n\nSome songs that have featured on Taylor Swift's setlist during previous Eras Tour concerts include Lover, Fearless, Evermore, Reputation, Speak Now, and many more.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UK Singles Chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evermore_(Taylor_Swift_album)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evermore (Taylor Swift album)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_Now_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speak Now (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_to_Burn", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Picture to Burn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fearless_(Taylor_Swift_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fearless (Taylor Swift song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Popular music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-109986675,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-18452,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546454", "eventUri": "eng-9546454", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 682, "textEnd": 687}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

The standard setlist was made up of songs from each of Swift's albums except her 2006 debut.\n\nBut at her first Paris show of the tour, Swift introduced a new \"era\" to represent her latest album.\n\nThe tour intro, featuring purple and pink waving pieces of fabric, notably features a medley of Swift singing the names of her albums, before kicking off her first song, \"Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince.\"\n\nOn May 9, the concert opening featured a new black-and-white onscreen background, the addition of a choral \"The Tortured Poets Department\" and a new orange and red bodysuit, foreshadowing several notable costume changes to come.\n\nDuring an edited \"Red\" era of the show, Swift teased that the crowd in Paris made her want to bring out \"all kinds of fun surprises.\"\n\nLater in the show, Swift officially debuted her new era with a \"Tortured Poets Department\" section of her show. Influencer Chris Olsen live-streamed the Paris concert from TikTok, and when the \"Tortured Poets\" era began, more than 200,000 users watched along.\n\nHere's what happened.\n\n\"The Tortured Poets Department\" section began ominously, with echoes of her voice from \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys\" and other songs.\n\nHere are the songs Swift performed from her 11th album:\n\nThe era introduced a new set piece -- a mirrored box that allowed Swift to glide and seemingly levitate -- across the stage as she belted out the album's powerful lyrics. She also seemingly re-created the sterile asylum-like set of her music video \"Fortnight\" onstage.\n\nAfter \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived,\" Swift seemingly laid lifeless on the stage until two dancers carried her over to a red heart shaped box. She changed costumes as a jazzy, theatrical instrumental track played before performing \"I Can Do It With A Broken Heart,\" juxtaposing the rousing beat with devastating lyrics.\n\nAfter the era, Swift went into the acoustic set, and told the crowd that her nickname for the \"Tortured Poets\" section is \"female rage, the musical.\"\n\nSwift first teased the addition of \"Tortured Poets\" to the setlist with a YouTube Short featuring her single \"Fortnight.\" In the black-and-white video, Swift shows fans a \"fortnight,\" or two-week period, in her life, including what appears to be rehearsals for the restart of the \"Eras Tour\" after two months off.\n\nIn several clips, fans noticed props and costumes that they didn't recognize from the \"Eras Tour,\" such as top hats and canes. Those top hats and canes came into play during the finale of the era, accompanied by a theater marquee that read, \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour.\"\n\nYes, several songs from the setlist were trimmed or dropped entirely, seemingly to make room for \"Tortured Poets.\"\n\nFirst, \"The Archer\" was cut from the \"Lover\" era. Then Swift made some major alterations to the order of the setlist. \"Red,\" normally the sixth section of the night, moved up, with \"22\" immediately following \"Fearless.\"\n\nAfter \"Red,\" the stage lights turned purple and a troupe of dancers came onstage to perform a new number to an orchestral version of \"Enchanted,\" which Swift sang after to usher in the \"Speak Now\" era. \"Long Live\" was cut from the setlist.\n\nWhile \"Reputation\" ran the same, Swift then combined her \"sister albums\" -- \"Folklore\" and \"Evermore\" -- into one era, which fans can call \"Everlore\" or \"Folkmore,\" she said onstage. That section saw significant trims, with Swift cutting \"The 1,\" \"The Last Great American Dynasty\" and \"Tolerate It.\"\n\nThe \"1989\" era remained unchanged and immediately preceded \"The Tortured Poets Department.\" The rest of the concert continued as normal.\n\nHere's the new order of Swift's eras, based on her first Paris concert:\n\nThis isn't the first time Swift's setlist has seen changes. The singer started her tour by only performing one song from her third studio album, \"Speak Now.\" But after the release of the rerecorded album in July 2023, Swift added \"Long Live\" to the setlist.\n\nThen, when Haim joined Swift on tour, she adjusted the opening to her \"Evermore\" set, swapping \"'Tis the Damn Season\" for \"No Body, No Crime.\"\n\nThe original setlist (minus \"'Tis the Damn Season\" and \"No Body, No Crime\") is notably immortalized in the \"Eras Tour\" concert film. The movie opened at AMC Theatres Oct. 13, 2023 with some trims. But an extended \"Taylor's Version\" of the concert film hit Disney+ March 14 with some of those fan-favorite songs added back in.", "source": {"uri": "today.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TODAY.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_and_white", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Black and white"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americana_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Americana (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Choir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acoustic music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_hat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Top hat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation_Stadium_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reputation Stadium Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/'Tis_the_Damn_Season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "'Tis the Damn Season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Body,_No_Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "No Body, No Crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Great_American_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Last Great American Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evermore_(Taylor_Swift_album)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evermore (Taylor Swift album)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enchanted_(Taylor_Swift_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enchanted (Taylor Swift song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore_(Taylor_Swift_album)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Folklore (Taylor Swift album)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Archer_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Archer (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_Now_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speak Now (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haim_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haim (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Theatres", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AMC Theatres"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Women_in_Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Women in Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1024x512_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-05/taylor-swift-mc-240508-228805.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546454", "eventUri": "eng-9546454", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 558, "textEnd": 563}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-14", "textStart": 4495, "textEnd": 4503}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-03-", "textStart": 66, "textEnd": 74}, {"amb": false, "date": "2013-10-", "textStart": 4397, "textEnd": 4404}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

After two eventful months off, Swift is kicking off the European leg of her massive tour.\n\nTaylor Swift embarked on the Eras Tour on March 17, 2023, in Glendale, Arizona, U.S. Since finishing her U.S. leg last summer, the Grammy-winning singer has also toured South America, Asia, and Australia with a huge global cultural impact. Her last concert was on Mar. 9 in Singapore, and she's officially back on with a four-date stop in Paris, France.\n\nHowever, during the two months of a well-deserved break, Swift didn't just sit and watch Netflix with her beau, Travis Kelce. In the time off, the singer premiered the concert film on Disney Plus, and also released her eleventh studio album, The Tortured Poets Department. After putting out 31 brand-new songs, the tour has also received a makeover.\n\nThe Eras Tour was born after Swift released five studio albums since her last tour, 2018's Reputation Stadium Tour. Since then, she released 2019's Lover, 2020's two pandemic sister albums Folklore and Evermore, and 2022's Midnights. The tour reflected all the eras she's had so far (except for the debut album, which was unfortunately absent from ten acts). With Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour available to stream on Disney Plus after premiering in theaters last October, Swift has decided to make several changes.\n\nSwift kicked off the Eras Tour in Paris, France with the Lover era, as usual. She wore a brand-new outfit, an orange bodysuit and blazer for \"The Man.\" \"The Archer,\" the last song of Act 1, was dropped. Fearless was the second act, which also introduced a different outfit, this time, a black and silver one. There weren't any other changes to the Fearless setlist.\n\nNormally, following Fearless, she'd dive right into Evermore and, after that, Reputation. Instead, this time she switched straight to Red. She debuted a brand-new T-shirt for \"22,\" reading, \"This Is Not Taylor's Version,\" a reference to her re-recorded albums. She didn't make any changes to the setlist.\n\nThe next era was Speak Now, another big change in the order of the acts. The era got a brand-new intro and a new dress. Swift also dropped \"Long Live,\" and went straight into the Reputation era. Swift kept the same Reputation outfit, the only era that never got an outfit update. There were no other changes to the setlist.\n\nAfter Reputation she went into Folklore, which got a brand-new intro. Wearing a new yellow dress, Swift hopped on top of the Folklore cabin and opened the era with \"Cardigan\" instead of \"The 1.\" Choosing chaos, after performing \"Betty\" she headed straight to the piano, explaining that she was finally uniting Folklore with Evermore. She then started singing \"Champagne Problems.\" Following the applause break, she went straight into \"August\" and \"Illicit Affairs.\" The next songs were \"My Tears Ricochet,\" \"Marjorie,\" and \"Willow.\"\n\nShe continued with 1989, where she debuted a multi-colored outfit for the first time with no changes to the setlist. After the 1989 act, she moved on to the new era, The Tortured Poets Department.\n\nThe most exciting thing about Swift's concert was the changes to the Eras Tour to fit in her latest studio album. On top of that, people were wondering which songs she'd perform from TTPD. Having made so many changes, Swift had enough space to introduce songs from her brand-new album.\n\n\"But Daddy I Love Him\" was the first song, which Swift performed with a white dress with the lyrics \"I love you, it's ruining my life\" on it, also wearing the \"Clara Bow\" choker. She then moved on to a \"So High School\" mashup, the song she seemingly wrote for her boyfriend, Travis Kelce. The next song was \"Who's Afraid Of Little Old Me,\" with a part of the stage moving her around as if she were levitating.\n\nSwift then moved on to \"Down Bad\" with a mashup with \"Fortnight,\" followed by \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\" and \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,\" shown on the screen in black and white.\n\nTo make room for her brand-new era, Swift had to drop several songs. The removed songs were some of the ones missing from the concert film, which fans widely speculated she would replace. Among them were \"The Archer\" and \"Long Live.\"\n\nAs she united the two sister albums, the songs she dropped were \"The 1,\" \"'Tis the Damn Season,\" \"Tolerate It,\" and \"The Last Great American Dynasty.\" She did keep \"Cardigan,\" which wasn't a part of the concert film but was added later on the Disney Plus version.\n\nFollowing the newly added TTPD act, she moved on to the acoustic set, and then Midnights, where she debuted a brand-new bodysuit. After the three-hour-long chaotic set filled with changes, Swift finished the concert with \"Karma,\" and was done for the night, ready to do it all over again all through the summer.", "source":

These shows mark the musician's return to the stage since wrapping up her Singapore shows in March.\n\nBreaking Down All of Taylor Swift's 'Eras Tour' Surprise Song Mash-Ups\n\nMeersseman also joked that he hopes Swifties don't \"crack\" the arena during the show, noting that over 250,000 tickets have been sold between her Paris and upcoming Lyon, France shows. (One of Swift's Seattle shows in July 2023 caused an 2.3 magnitude earthquake with seismologists confirmed.)\n\nHe further discussed the \"runaway effect\" surrounding Swift explaining \"that the more we talk about her, the more she grows.\" Meersseman even praised how she \"combines music, media presence and the political side.\"\n\nWhen discussing the Eras Tour show, the promoter admitted that preparation for Swift has been \"intense\" overall - but it seems they're ready.\n\nFans started to speculate that Swift was including TTPD songs to her Eras Tour setlist following the record's April 19 release.\n\nShe teased tour preparation with a short black-and-white video posted via social media on April 25, alongside a caption that read, \"A fortnight till Paris.\" The quick clips showed Swift practicing her setlist alongside her dancers. Eagle-eyed fans clocked what appeared to be the TTPD logo on stage.\n\nSwift could also be seen wearing black lace-up heels as she stood near one of the set's railings. Some fans compared the shoes to what she wore in the music video for \"Fortnight\" - which is TTPD's lead single - alongside Post Malone.\n\nAll the Famous Names Taylor Swift Drops on 'The Tortured Poets Department'\n\nAside from the possible new songs, fans are also wondering if Travis Kelce will join Swift on tour once again. The NFL star has been supporting his girlfriend in various cities around the world as she takes the stage. (Swift and Kelce went public with their relationship in September 2023.)\n\nMost recently, Kelce was with Swift in Singapore in March before they jetted back to Los Angeles together.\n\n\"They're focused on rest and recuperation and relaxing at home and having low-key and chill time together,\" a source told Us Weekly exclusively at the time, referring to Swift's break from tour and Kelce's NFL break. \"They are enjoying movie nights in her home theater, catching up on films and shows they've missed.\"\n\nSwift will have played a total of 152 Eras Tour shows in 54 cities worldwide by the end of 2024.", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shelby_stivale@miamiherald.com", "name": "Shelby Stivale", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_La_D\u00e9fense_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris La D\u00e9fense Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richter magnitude scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earthquake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seismology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lyon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lyon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Post Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_single", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lead single"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Hypnotism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Hypnotism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Shows_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Shows and Events", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events_and_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events and Shows", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/rche32/picture288431675/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/19ee3f09-5972-4a1b-bd3d-4f0675403056", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546454", "eventUri": "eng-9546454", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-19", "textStart": 1019, "textEnd": 1027}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 1128, "textEnd": 1136}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Taylor Swift has come straight from The Tortured Poets Department to the Paris La Defense Arena, and she's brought her typewriter. On the opening night of the European leg of The Eras Tour in Paris, France, Swift debuted live versions of her latest double album release: The Tortured Poets Department and The Tortured Poets Department:The Anthology.\n\nIn a dramatic shift after the 1989 set, Swift took the stage in a white gown straight from the \"Fortnight\" music video to usher in a whole new era to The Eras Tour. It's truly tortured with \"But Daddy I Love Him,\" \"So High School,\" \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?,\" \"Down Bad\" and \"Fortnight\" as additions.\n\nThe additional era was not the only change to The Era's Tour set list. Before Swift took the stage, eagle-eyed fans noticed the addition of TTPD lyrics from the title track and \"The Alchemy\" in the opening mash-up intro. The eras correlating to each album were also switched around, with Red and Speak Now sets coming after the Lover and before Folklore and Evermore. Swift also cut plenty of songs from the set list, including \"The Archer,\" \"Long Live,\" \"'Tis the Damn Season,\" \"Tolerate It,\" \"The 1,\" and \"The Last Great American Dynasty.\"\n\nThere were also some notable outfit changes from a new pink and orange sparkling bodysuit for Lover to a different T-shirt for the Red era that cryptically donned the message \"This Is Not Taylor's Version.\"\n\nDuring the Red era, Swift played into the chaos of the changes. Before performing \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version), she told concertgoers, \"I see the reactions from this crowd... it makes us want to show you all kinds of fun surprises.\"\n\nFans began speculating about how The Tortured Poets Department would be included in Swift's upcoming tour dates since double album's release on April 19. Theories swirled as soon as the pop star shared a video of tour rehearsals a \"fortnight\" before the show in Paris, which seemed to include new stage sets and choreography.\n\nAs Swift said during the Arlington, Texas stop of the The Eras Tour, \"Let it be said about the Eras Tour, we're tricksy.

New outfits, set pieces and choreography were also present.\n\nRelated: Matty Healy Is 'Tuning Out the Noise' After Taylor Swift's 'Tortured Poets Department' Release: Source (Exclusive)\n\nFans realized they were in for a fresh Eras Tour experience when the concert's introduction video was changed to include a TTPD section of the Lover house representing each of Swift's eras.\n\nAs per usual, she opened the show with the Lover section -- but skipped \"The Archer.\" From there, the Grammy winner went into Fearless followed by Red, performing the sections in a different order than during the previous tour legs. Another nod to the setlist switch-ups? Swift sported a t-shirt that read, \"This Is Not Taylor's Version,\" while performing \"22.\"\n\nNext came the Speak Now section, and she removed \"Long Live,\" which was initially added following the July 2023 release of the album's rerecorded Taylor's Version.\n\nThe Reputation segment then arrived, followed by a combined Folklore and Evermore section with \"The 1,\" \"The Last Great American Dynasty,\" \"Tolerate It\" and \"'Tis the Damn Season\" getting cut.\n\n\"I have always talked about Folklore and Evermore as sister albums,\" explained Swift on stage. \"On the Eras Tour, we have reunited the sisters, combined them into one chapter, you can call it 'Folkmore,' 'Everlore,' you can call it whatever you want as long as you promise to sing 'Champagne Problems' really loud.\"\n\nThe 1989 section came afterwards, and then The Tortured Poets Department. The section highlighting Swift's latest album featured \"But Daddy I Love Him,\" \"So High School,\" \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me,\" \"Down Bad,\" \"Fortnight,\" \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\" and \"I Can Do It with a Broken Heart.\"\n\nSwift then performed two surprise songs: \"Paris\" from Midnights and \"loml\" from TTPD.\n\nThe show concluded with the Midnights section, with all seven tracks from previous shows remaining in the setlist.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy

tour\" -- she has kept busy, attending Coachella, enjoying date nights with boyfriend Travis Kelce and, of course, releasing her latest album.\n\nRelated: All of the Celebrities Who've Attended Taylor

Swift updated the mix to include a reference to TTPD.\n\nWith new songs coming into the three-hour set, it was inevitable that fans would have to say goodbye to some tracks. \"The Archer\" and \"Long Live\" were the first ones to get the ax.\n\nAfter Red, Swift goes into her Speak Now era, which includes a new transition featuring floral images on the screen and her dancers performing a new routine before she sings \"Enchanted.\"", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kaitlin_simpson@usmagazine.com", "name": "Kaitlin Simpson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enchanted_(Taylor_Swift_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enchanted (Taylor Swift song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Archer_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Archer (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_Now_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speak Now (song)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Feature-Every-Change-Taylor-Swift-Has-Made-to-The-Eras-Tour-for-the-European-Leg.jpg?crop=295px%2C146px%2C1398px%2C735px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546454", "eventUri": "eng-9546454", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 131, "textEnd": 136, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

During the show, she added six songs to the already packed lineup: \"But Daddy I Love Him\" with a snippet of \"So High School\" as the outro, \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me,\" \"Down Bad,\" \"Fortnight,\" The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\" and \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.\" Swift also played \"loml\" during the acoustic set, right after the Midnights song \"Paris.\"\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department set began with Swift's background dancers slowly progressing onto the stage dressed all in white. Swift then emerged in a white dress with black ink writing on the skirt. She also donned a black choker necklace similar to the one she wore to the Grammys in February, the night she announced TTPD. Swift later removed the dress to reveal a black, sparkly bralette and matching high-waisted underwear. She added a gold jacket to the ensemble to perform the final song of the TTPD set, \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.\"\n\nSwift has been on a two-month hiatus from her tour since performing in Singapore in March. During her time off, she released her 11th studio album in April, which she described in an Instagram post at the time as \"an anthology of new works that reflect events, opinions and sentiments from a fleeting and fatalistic moment in time -- one that was both sensational and sorrowful in equal measure.\"\n\nShe continued: \"This period of the author's life is now over, the chapter closed and boarded up. There is nothing to avenge, no scores to settle once wounds have healed. And upon further reflection, a good number of them turned out to be self-inflicted. This writer is of the firm belief that our tears become holy in the form of ink on a page. Once we have spoken our saddest story, we can be free of it. And then all that's left behind is the tortured poetry.\"\n\nTwo hours after the album's release, Swift dropped 15 additional songs. \"It's a 2 a.m. surprise: The Tortured Poets Department is a secret DOUBLE album,\" she wrote via Instagram. \"I'd written so much tortured poetry in the past two years and wanted to share it all with you, so here's the second installment of TTPD: The Anthology. Fifteen extra songs. And now the story isn't mine anymore ... it's all yours.\"\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department broke a multitude of records upon its debut, with its first-week total sales coming in at 2.61 million units. Swift celebrated the accomplishment in an April Instagram post.\n\n\"My mind is blown. I'm completely floored by the love you've shown this album,\" she gushed. \"2.6 million ARE YOU ACTUALLY SERIOUS?? Thank you for listening, streaming and welcoming Tortured Poets into your life. Feeling completely overwhelmed.\"\n\nSwift then shared her enthusiasm over returning to the Eras Tour after the album's success. \"I was already so fired up to get back to the tour but you doing THIS??\" she concluded. \"May 9th can't come soon enough.\"\n\nThe Eras Tour kicked off in March 2023 and will run through December, and it already had a massive three-and-a-half hour setlist that highlighted hits from throughout Swift's career. Still, fans speculated in April that she was planning to add The Tortured Poets Department after she shared a YouTube Shorts video of her tour rehearsals, where Swifties spotted several hints that changes were in the works. In one clip, Swift posed in front of a sign that appeared to feature the album's logo, and in another segment, her backup dancers seemed to be practicing with new props.", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erin_crabtree@usmagazine.com", "name": "Erin Crabtree", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "us_weekly@usmagazine.com", "name": "Us Weekly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midnights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_Bad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Down Bad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_La_D\u00e9fense_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris La D\u00e9fense Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conclusion_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conclusion (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acoustic music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_recording_certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music recording certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poetry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_Shorts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube Shorts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_album", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthology_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthology series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Poetry", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Poetry", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums_and_Frames", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums and Frames", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Art_and_Literature", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Art and Literature", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Poetry", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Poetry", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Taylor-Swift-Adds-'The-Tortured-Poets-Department-to-Her-'Eras-Tour-Setlist-in-Paris-Concert-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1998px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546454", "eventUri": "eng-9546454", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 252, "textEnd": 257, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Further adding fuel the speculation, her dancers posted a video of them dancing to her new track \"So Long, London\" in early May.\n\nIn addition to adding The Tortured Poets Department to the setlist, Swift made a handful of other big changes to the Eras Tour, including many new costumes and new performances.\n\nRead ahead for the biggest changes to the Eras Tour.\n\nRelated: Taylor Swift's Eras Tour Surprise Songs: The List So Far\n\nSwift first teased the addition of The Tortured Poets Department at the beginning of the show. To the intro, which features Swift naming all of her album titles, she added a clip of her singing the title track \"The Tortured Poets Department.\" Additionally, fans noted that she added the lyric \"What if I told you I'm back?\" featured in the song \"The Alchemy,\" which fans have theorized is about her boyfriend Travis Kelce.\n\nThe singer debuted several new costumes during her Paris show. She kicked things off with her Lover set by donning a bright orange bodysuit as well as matching shoes and a blazer (all Versace) as she performed \"The Man.\"\n\nAs she transitioned into her Fearless era, she debuted a silver and black fringe dress, which is much more reminiscent of the dress she wore during her original Fearless Tour in 2009, and had a new gown for her Speak Now set.\n\nAdditionally, she wore a new shirt during her \"22\" performance, which read: \"This is not Taylor's Version\" (a new addition to the rotation), which had fans speculating about what it could mean.\n\nHer Folklore era also included a new yellow dress while her 1989 set included a pink and green two-piece which gave fans vibes of Ariel's outfit in The Little Mermaid (which was released in, you guessed it, 1989 and contains the line \"Daddy, I love him!\" -- just like a song onTTPD). The outfit also included one pink and one green shoe.\n\nMeanwhile, her Reputation outfit stayed the same: a Roberto Cavalli catsuit which she has worn the entire tour.\n\nWith the addition of songs from the new album, Swift cut a few tracks from the original setlist. Some of the most notable cuts include \"The Archer\" which previously ended the Lover era, \"Long Live,\" which was a more recent addition to the Speak Now set, and several Folklore and Evermore songs including \"The Last Great American Dynasty,\" \"Willow\" and \"Tolerate It.\"\n\nSwift also reordered some of the eras. In the past, the Folklore era had followed her Red set, but in Paris she changed things up by having Speak Now directly follow her performance of Red's \"All Too Well.\"\n\nAnother major change is that Folklore and Evermore are now combined into one set. As she sat at the piano to perform \"Champagne Problems,\" Swift explained that she always saw the two albums as part of a whole, with Folklore representing spring/summer and Evermore representing fall/winter. \"On the Eras Tour, we have now reunited the sisters [and] combined them into one chapter,\" she said, joking fans can call the new era \"Folkmore\" or \"Everlore.\"\n\nThe new order of the eras is as follows: Lover, Fearless, Red, Speak Now, Reputation, Folklore and Evermore (now combined), 1989, The Tortured Poets Department, the acoustic set and Midnights.\n\nAdditionally, there are several new visuals that pop up on the screen as Swift transitions from one set to the other. The Speak Now set includes what appears to be a visual of a flower blooming before two of Swift's backup dancers appear on the stage for an intimate performance.\n\nShe plays a good amount of songs from the 31-track anthology during the set, with some of the most notable being \"Down Bad,\" \"Fortnight\" and \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?\" She also includes \"So High School,\" rumored to be about Kelce, during a quick transition between songs.\n\nShe ends the set with a show-stopping performance of \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,\" which includes many visual references to film's golden age -- perhaps a nod to Clara Bow? -- including Swift's name on a marquee and dancers in top hats and canes.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore_(Taylor_Swift_album)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Folklore (Taylor Swift album)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_Now_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speak Now (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation_Stadium_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reputation Stadium Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evermore_(Taylor_Swift_album)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evermore (Taylor Swift album)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fearless_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fearless Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fearless_(Taylor_Swift_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fearless (Taylor Swift song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Cavalli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roberto Cavalli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Little Mermaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blazer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibraphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vibraphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versace", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Versace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midnights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Great_American_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Last Great American Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Willow (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne_Problems_(Taylor_Swift_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Champagne Problems (Taylor Swift song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Archer_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Archer (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Too_Well", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All Too Well"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Bow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clara Bow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acoustic music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/_6QGY_y27yj4NgWxB3zBpA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/0400880d71745aac12d5ec4ba86615e5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546454", "eventUri": "eng-9546454", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 61, "textEnd": 66}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Because let's face it, if Swift had showed up at the event, the night would inevitably become all about her.\n\nAfter Swift, 34, and her NFL boyfriend, 33, made a surprise appearance at Coachella last month, many wondered if the they were gearing up to make their splashy red-carpet debut on the Met steps on Monday, May 6 -- sort of like Swift's protege Sabrina Carpenter and her new boyfriend, Barry Keoghan, did. After all, Swift hadn't attended the California music festival since 2016, the same year that marked her last appearance at the Met Gala.\n\nThis year's gala took place three days before Swift resumes the Eras Tour in Paris and well before Kelce has to report to NFL training camp in July, so, technically speaking, it was doable. (This is the same woman who flew directly from a show in Tokyo to Las Vegas to cheer on Kelce at the Super Bowl, after all.)\n\nThat said, back on April 30 People reported that Swift would be sitting this one out, choosing instead to focus on the next leg of her Eras Tour. And, as usual, they were right.\n\nMany fans anticipate that she'll be introducing several new songs to her lineup from The Tortured Poets Department, the double album she dropped on April 19, and such a big changeup is probably requiring extra rehearsals. I mean, it makes sense!\n\nOver the course of her career, Swift has attended six Met Galas, looking pretty and polished in a floor-length gown at each, save for in 2016, when she wore a metallic Louis Vuitton minidress and dark lipstick.\n\nAccording to a TMZ report, both parties received a personal invitation to the event. If Swift had decided to attend, it would have been a cool way for the billionaire to cap off the promotional run for her 11th album, The Tortured Poets Department.\n\nAs a general rule, though, Swift does not walk red carpets with her boyfriends, and the Met Gala is sort of a loaded event in the Swift-verse. It's where she danced with Tom Hiddleston, on the same night she met camera-shy Joe Alwyn, whom she would date right after Hiddleston.\n\nBut while Alwyn reportedly preferred to keep their relationship out of the spotlight, that's...not a problem Kelce has. Dude loves a photo op and has already made an appearance on Swift's social media. Their intimate at-home PDA is featured in the YouTube Shorts video for her song \"Fortnight.\" Clearly, the old rules no longer apply.\n\nSwift's declined invite may have also been a means of avoiding the drama. In the eight years since Swift last showed up, the Kardashians have all but taken over the steps. Having her friends modeling for Skims is one thing, but actually running into nemesis Kim is another. After all, her feelings about Kardashian are strong enough for the reality star to allegedly receive another diss track on The Tortured Poets Department, titled \"thanK you aIMee.\" And you know what, Swift probably also wanted to avoid former bestie Karlie Kloss too.\n\nSo, there you have it. A Taylor Swift Met Gala in 2024 was simply not in the cards.

The 34-year-old pop star returned to her global Eras Tour on Thursday (May 9) following a two-month break, kicking off the trek's European leg at La Defense Arena in Paris for the first of four planned shows at the venue -- complete with several new costumes, dance numbers, visuals, special effects and, best of all, songs.\n\nDuring the break, Swift released her new album The Tortured Poets Department, which immediately debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and broke several records along the way. But with a new LP in the books, fans couldn't help but wonder how the singer would shake up her tried-and-true setlist to make room for the new material.\n\nAnd make room, she did. Swift ended up cutting several numbers from her past eras and restructuring the show to carve out space for a total of seven tracks from Tortured Poets -- or, \"As I like to call it, 'Female Rage: The Musical,'\" the 14-time Grammy winner joked right after the TTPD section concluded, transitioning into the nightly surprise-song section. The new segment of the Eras show also featured the superstar levitating over the stage, getting abducted by a UFO and a ragtime jazz interlude.\n\n\"This has been an unforgettable night in Paris!\" Swift gushed to the crowd before closing out as usual with \"Karma.\" \"Thank you so much!\"\n\nKeep reading to see all the songs Swift performed at her first show following the release of Tortured Poets below, era by era, and check out how it compares to her original setlist here.", "source": {"uri": "billboard.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Billboard"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hannah_dailey@billboard.com", "name": "Hannah Dailey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_200", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billboard 200"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LP_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LP record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_(TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rage (TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragtime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ragtime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unidentified flying object"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jazz"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Women_in_Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Women in Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Taylor-Swift-02-The-Eras-Tour-Paris-France-may-9-2024-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546454", "eventUri": "eng-9546454", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 202, "textEnd": 207}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

(One of Swift's Seattle shows in July 2023 caused an 2.3 magnitude earthquake with seismologists confirmed.)\n\nHe further discussed the \"runaway effect\" surrounding Swift explaining \"that the more we talk about her, the more she grows.\" Meersseman even praised how she \"combines music, media presence and the political side.\"\n\nWhen discussing the Eras Tour show, the promoter admitted that preparation for Swift has been \"intense\" overall -- but it seems they're ready.\n\nFans started to speculate that Swift was including TTPD songs to her Eras Tour setlist following the record's April 19 release.\n\nShe teased tour preparation with a short black-and-white video posted via social media on April 25, alongside a caption that read, \"A fortnight till Paris.\" The quick clips showed Swift practicing her setlist alongside her dancers. Eagle-eyed fans clocked what appeared to be the TTPD logo on stage.\n\nSwift could also be seen wearing black lace-up heels as she stood near one of the set's railings. Some fans compared the shoes to what she wore in the music video for \"Fortnight\" -- which is TTPD's lead single -- alongside Post Malone.\n\nAside from the possible new songs, fans are also wondering if Travis Kelce will join Swift on tour once again. The NFL star has been supporting his girlfriend in various cities around the world as she takes the stage. (Swift and Kelce went public with their relationship in September 2023.)\n\n\"They're focused on rest and recuperation and relaxing at home and having low-key and chill time together,\" a source told Us Weekly exclusively at the time, referring to Swift's break from tour and Kelce's NFL break. \"They are enjoying movie nights in her home theater, catching up on films and shows they've missed.\"\n\nSwift will have played a total of 152 Eras Tour shows in 54 cities worldwide by the end of 2024.", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shelby_stivale@usmagazine.com", "name": "Shelby Stivale", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_La_D\u00e9fense_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris La D\u00e9fense Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richter magnitude scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earthquake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seismology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lyon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lyon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_and_white", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black and white"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Post Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_single", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lead single"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Comedy", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Comedy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Taylor-Swift-Will-Add-TTPD-Songs-to-Eras-Tour-Set-Promoter-Confirms-001.jpg?crop=0px%2C100px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546454", "eventUri": "eng-9546454", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 112, "textEnd": 117}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-19", "textStart": 1068, "textEnd": 1076}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 1177, "textEnd": 1185}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Further adding fuel the speculation, her dancers posted a video of them dancing to her new track \"So Long, London\" in early May.\n\nIn addition to adding The Tortured Poets Department to the setlist, Swift made a handful of other big changes to the Eras Tour, including many new costumes and new performances.\n\nRead ahead for the biggest changes to the Eras Tour.\n\nSwift first teased the addition of The Tortured Poets Department at the beginning of the show. To the intro, which features Swift naming all of her album titles, she added a clip of her singing the title track \"The Tortured Poets Department.\" Additionally, fans noted that she added the lyric \"What if I told you I'm back?\" featured in the song \"The Alchemy,\" which fans have theorized is about her boyfriend Travis Kelce.\n\nThe singer debuted several new costumes during her Paris show. She kicked things off with her Lover set by donning a bright orange bodysuit as well as matching shoes and a blazer (all Versace) as she performed \"The Man.\"\n\nAs she transitioned into her Fearless era, she debuted a silver and black fringe dress, which is much more reminiscent of the dress she wore during her original Fearless Tour in 2009, and had a new gown for her Speak Now set.\n\nAdditionally, she wore a new shirt during her \"22\" performance, which read: \"This is not Taylor's Version\" (a new addition to the rotation), which had fans speculating about what it could mean.\n\nHer Folklore era also included a new yellow dress while her 1989 set included a pink and green two-piece which gave fans vibes of Ariel's outfit in The Little Mermaid (which was released in, you guessed it, 1989 and contains the line \"Daddy, I love him!\" -- just like a song onTTPD). The outfit also included one pink and one green shoe.\n\nMeanwhile, her Reputation outfit stayed the same: a Roberto Cavalli catsuit which she has worn the entire tour.\n\nWith the addition of songs from the new album, Swift cut a few tracks from the original setlist. Some of the most notable cuts include \"The Archer\" which previously ended the Lover era, \"Long Live,\" which was a more recent addition to the Speak Now set, and several Folklore and Evermore songs including \"The Last Great American Dynasty,\" \"Willow\" and \"Tolerate It.\"\n\nSwift also reordered some of the eras. In the past, the Folklore era had followed her Red set, but in Paris she changed things up by having Speak Now directly follow her performance of Red's \"All Too Well.\"\n\nAnother major change is that Folklore and Evermore are now combined into one set. As she sat at the piano to perform \"Champagne Problems,\" Swift explained that she always saw the two albums as part of a whole, with Folklore representing spring/summer and Evermore representing fall/winter. \"On the Eras Tour, we have now reunited the sisters [and] combined them into one chapter,\" she said, joking fans can call the new era \"Folkmore\" or \"Everlore.\"\n\nThe new order of the eras is as follows: Lover, Fearless, Red, Speak Now, Reputation, Folklore and Evermore (now combined), 1989, The Tortured Poets Department, the acoustic set and Midnights.\n\nAdditionally, there are several new visuals that pop up on the screen as Swift transitions from one set to the other. The Speak Now set includes what appears to be a visual of a flower blooming before two of Swift's backup dancers appear on the stage for an intimate performance.\n\nShe plays a good amount of songs from the 31-track anthology during the set, with some of the most notable being \"Down Bad,\" \"Fortnight\" and \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?\" She also includes \"So High School,\" rumored to be about Kelce, during a quick transition between songs.\n\nShe ends the set with a show-stopping performance of \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,\" which includes many visual references to film's golden age -- perhaps a nod to Clara Bow? -- including Swift's name on a marquee and dancers in top hats and canes.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore_(Taylor_Swift_album)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Folklore (Taylor Swift album)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_Now_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speak Now (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation_Stadium_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reputation Stadium Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evermore_(Taylor_Swift_album)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evermore (Taylor Swift album)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fearless_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fearless Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fearless_(Taylor_Swift_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fearless (Taylor Swift song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Cavalli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roberto Cavalli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Little Mermaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blazer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibraphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vibraphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versace", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Versace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midnights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Great_American_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Last Great American Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Willow (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne_Problems_(Taylor_Swift_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Champagne Problems (Taylor Swift song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Archer_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Archer (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Too_Well", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All Too Well"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Bow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clara Bow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acoustic music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/8NPAsxqH2RrWjH6VNYHZX-DX-Lo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(767x117:769x119)/Taylor-Swift-Eras-Tour-Paris-050924-b8f154c76e3d4911ae924fcfa698a287.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546454", "eventUri": "eng-9546454", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 129, "textEnd": 134}], "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

As the relaunched tour follows the release of her 11th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, Swift has made significant changes to the 3-hour-long setlist. After Sabrina Carpenter during Sydney and Singapore shows, Paramore has now joined Swift as the opening act for the European leg of the tour.\n\nThe 34-year-old pop icon kicked off the show with the Lover set, which included the songs- Miss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince, Cruel Summer, The Man, You Need to Calm Down, and Lover. Previously, this set also included The Archer, which appears to have now been removed from the setlist.\n\nLover was followed by Fearless, which included the same setlist per usual consisting of the songs- Fearless, You Belong With Me, and Love Story.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Swift took on the Red era next as opposed to it being the fifth set in the previous shows. It included the songs- 22, We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together, I Knew You Were Trouble, and All Too Well (10-minute version).\n\nThe Speak Now set was another surprise change of order and included one song- Enchanted. Swift removed the fan-favourite Long Live from the set.\n\nAfter a dreamy performance of Enchanted, the Reputation era began with the songs- Ready For It?, Delicate, Don't Blame Me, and Look What You Made Me Do.\n\nFans were in for another surprise as a new set, Folkmore made its debut. It is a mashup of what Swift calls the two sister albums- Folklore and Evermore. The songs included in this segment were Cardigan, Betty, Champagne Problems, August, Illicit Affairs, My Tears Ricochet, Marjorie, and Willow.\n\nSwift removed four songs from the Evermore and Folklore setlist. The songs that failed to make the cut for this segment were 'Tis the Damn Season, Tolerate It, The 1, and The Last Great American Dynasty.\n\nSwift began her 1989 setlist with Style, followed by Blank Space, Shake It Off, Wildest Dreams, and Bad Blood. No cuts were made in this set.\n\nThe brand-new set featured tracks from Swift's recently released album TTPD. The tracks that she performed during the show were But Daddy I Love Him, So High School, Who's Afraid of Little Old Me, Down Bad, Fortnight, The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived, and I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.\n\nSwift then performed the secret set, which included the songs, loml from TTPD, and Paris, a bonus song from her Midnights album.\n\nFor the final segment, Swift performed the Midnights set, which included the songs Lavender Haze, Anti-Hero, Midnight Rain, Vigilante S**t, Bejeweled, Mastermind, and Karma.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news",

Is Travis Kelce going?", "body": "The singer is headed to the French capital to launch the European leg of her \"Eras Tour\" at the Paris La D\u00e9fense Arena from May 9 to May 12.\n\nSome Swifties are traveling thousands of miles to catch one of the singer's four Paris shows -- and in fact, anywhere between 20% and 30% of fans set to watch Swift in Paris are American, the arena's CEO, Frederic Longu\u00e9p\u00e9e, told NBC News.\n\nParisian hotels and restaurants will be packed throughout the weekend, which is a good test for the city's infrastructure and security leading up to another major event this summer: the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\n\"For four nights, we'll be the center of the world, which is important to us, because it's a rehearsal for the Olympics, obviously,\" Longu\u00e9p\u00e9e said.\n\nThese shows mark the first time Swift has performed onstage since the release of her record-shattering studio album, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" and many fans are wondering whether tracks from the new album will make it into Swift's Paris set list.\n\nSwifties are also wondering whether a certain NFL star will be spending time with the singer in the City of Light.\n\nRead on to learn more about Taylor Swift's Paris \"Eras Tour\" shows, including how to buy last-minute tickets.\n\nThere will be four \"Eras Tour\" dates in Paris on May 9, 10, 11 and 12, with shows beginning at 6:30 p.m. local time.\n\nEach show will take place at the Paris La D\u00e9fense Arena, which is the largest indoor performance venue in Europe. The massive venue can accommodate 40,000 spectators in \"concert mode,\" according to the arena's website. Gates will open for attendees at 4:45 p.m.\n\nSince Swift's shows start around 6:30 p.m. in Paris, Americans looking to follow along online should anticipate doing so at 12:30 p.m. ET.\n\nAs of this writing on the morning of May 9, there are still last-minute tickets available to Swift's Paris shows.\n\nAccording to SeatPick, a website that aggregates tickets from StubHub and other sellers, there are still tickets available for Swift's May 9 show starting at just over $100 each for general admission, and reaching more than $1,100 each for premium tickets.\n\nThere are also tickets available for the May 10 and May 11 shows starting at around $160, and tickets for the final Paris show on May 12 starting at $180.\n\nPrices are kept so (comparatively) low due to France's stricter laws around reselling tickets. Fans are not allowed to resell tickets for more than their original sale value, according to Ticketmaster's French website.\n\nKelce hasn't confirmed whether he will be joining Swift in the City of Light, but he said in the past he would definitely be supporting his girlfriend during the European leg of her \"Eras Tour.\"\n\n\"London's always an amazing city, Paris is a beautiful city. She'll be all over Europe, so there won't be a bad show, I promise you that,\" the Kansas City Chiefs tight end told \"Entertainment Tonight\" in April.\n\nAsked whether he would be packing his bags for any show in particular, Kelce replied, \"Oh, you know I gotta go support.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, I think we're both very career driven,\" he added. \"I think we both love what we do, and any chance that I can show my support to her, and knowing that she's showing me all the support in the world throughout the season, it's just been an amazing experience getting to know Tay.\"\n\nThe weekend before Swift headed to Paris, Kelce was living his best life at the Kentucky Derby. The NFL star opened up about the \"once-in-a-lifetime experience\" at the May 4 race at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\n\"I'm a Derby guy now, man,\" Kelce said on the May 8 episode of the \"New Heights\" podcast with his brother, Jason Kelce. \"It was so much fun.\"\n\nThe question now is, will Kelce be taken by the view in Paris?\n\nSwift's Paris shows will be her first live performances since the release of her latest album, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" in April.\n\nMany Swifties are wondering whether any songs from the new double album will be added to her \"Eras Tour\" set list.\n\nConsidering Swift's \"Eras Tour\" is a celebration of all her studio albums, dating back to her eponymous debut album in 2006, it would only make sense for her latest album to be featured, too.\n\nThe singer hinted as much in an April 25 YouTube Shorts video, which showed a montage of Swift and her backup dancers rehearsing for their European shows.\n\nMany of the scenes were familiar from previous \"Eras Tour\" shows, but fans noticed one brand-new scene: Swift standing with her backup dancers behind her sporting top hats and holding canes.\n\n\"OMG SHE IS ADDING A NEW ERAAAAAAAAAA,\"one fan commented on her YouTube video.\n\n\"WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS MEANS TAYLOR IS ADDING TTPD TO THE ERAS TOUR SETLIST!?!?\" another person wrote.\n\n\"The Tortured Poets Department\" has been shattering records since its April 19 release. The day it came out, the album became Spotify's most-streamed album in a single day, and Swift became Spotify's most-streamed artist in a single day, the streaming service announced on Instagram.\n\nThe album also launched with a record-breaking 2.6 million equivalent album units (which includes downloads, streams, and CD, vinyl and cassette sales) earned the first week of its release in the U.S., according Luminate, Billboard reported.\n\nSwift said her \"mind is blown\" by the album's success.\n\n\"I'm completely floored by the love you've shown this album,\" she wrote in an April 28 Instagram post. \"2.6 million ARE YOU ACTUALLY SERIOUS?? Thank you for listening, streaming, and welcoming Tortured Poets into your life. Feeling completely overwhelmed.\n\n\"I was already so fired up to get back to the tour but you doing THIS??\" she added. \"May 9th can't come soon enough.\"", "source": {"uri": "today.com",

Then she switched up the set order, performing tracks from \"Red,\" \"Speak Now\" and \"Reputation,\" instead of transitioning to \"Evermore,\" as she had during the previous leg of the tour. \"Folklore\" followed \"Reputation,\" accompanied by new visuals featuring a snake slithering through the grass.\n\nThe singer announced that she has always seen \"Folklore\" and \"Evermore\" as sister albums and would be combining them into \"one chapter\" at the show, stating, \"We have now reunited the sisters.\" She then performed songs from both albums before segueing into \"1989.\"\n\nAfter \"1989,\" new visuals then signaled a transition into \"The Tortured Poets Department.\"\n\nEver since Swift announced that she'd be dropping a brand-new album in the middle of the Eras Tour, fans have been speculating as to how she would include it in the setlist. Some predicted the record would mark an entirely new era, while others thought she might just represent it within the surprise songs portion of the show.\n\n\"The Tortured Poets Department\" released on April 19, and Swift surprised fans with a double album consisting of 31 songs. It debuted with 2.61 million units, marking the best one-week figure for any album in nine years. The album also took up the first 14 spots on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, making Swift the first artist to do so. \"Fortnight,\" her duet with Post Malone, took the No. 1 spot.\n\n\"The Tortured Poets Department\" earned critical praise as well, with Variety's Chris Willman calling it \"audacious\" and \"transfixing.\" He wrote that the album \"gives everyone a full dose of the never-getting-over-it Taylor that no one really wanted to get over.

So it comes as no surprise that her new album The Tortured Poets Department, which will likely be incorporated into her already very long setlist, is seeing similar levels of success.\n\nBefore Tortured Poets was released on April 19, the album already broke a Spotify record, indicating that it would reach numbers that Swift hadn't seen before. This proved true on release day when it broke several streaming records across all platforms.\n\nBy the end of its first week, even Swift was left speechless, as she made clear on X (formerly Twitter). \"What do you MEAN,\" she wrote in response to her album sales. After finding out about another record she set on the Billboard Hot 100, she declared, \"You've outdone yourselves, this is unbelievable.\"\n\nThese are the records that Swift has broken with Tortured Poets -- so far.\n\nBefore its release, The Tortured Poets Department became the most pre-saved album in Spotify history. This only set the stage for Swift's album to make history on Spotify and other streaming platforms.\n\nThe day after its release, Spotify crowned Tortured Poets as the most streamed album in a single day. Not only did Swift break her own record that Midnights held by surpassing 200 million streams, but Tortured Poets became the first album ever to reach over 300 million streams in one day. Swift also broke the same record on Amazon Music and was the most streamed pop album on Apple Music.\n\nTortured Poets was just as big of a phenomenon globally as in the U.S., bolstered by Swift taking the Eras Tour to South America, Asia, Australia, and Europe, for her first shows in some countries. The album accumulated an eye-popping 1.76 billion streams worldwide in its first week, marking the biggest global streaming week since Billboard began its Global 200 chart.\n\nAfter a week, Tortured Poets debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 as expected, but broke many records in the process. Swift achieved the second-largest album sales week in history with 2.61 million units sold, only behind Adele's 25. About 859,000 of those sold units were vinyls, making it the largest sales week for an album on vinyl in the modern era.\n\nOn the Billboard Hot 100, Swift became the first artist ever to hold the Top 14 positions of the chart, with her Post Malone collab, \"Fortnight,\" holding the number one spot. She previously took over the Top 10 after Midnights was released, but fittingly, she extended her reign to 14, which is exactly how many days are in a fortnight.\n\nIn addition to dominating the Top 14, all 31 songs off The Tortured Poets Department and its surprise second part, The Anthology, charted on the Hot 100. With her 2019 hit \"Cruel Summer\" also still charting, Swift set the record for most simultaneous entries by a female artist on the chart with 32 tracks, and became the first woman to earn over 50 Top 10 songs in her career.", "source": {"uri": "bustle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bustle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midnights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billboard Hot 100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruel_Summer_(Bananarama_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cruel Summer (Bananarama song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Global_200", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billboard Global 200"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Post Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phonograph record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_200", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billboard 200"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adele", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billboard (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums_and_Frames", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums and Frames", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Scrapbooking", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Scrapbooking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2024/5/8/2841bb47-af5e-48ee-88cf-83c174f7256a-getty-1987932445.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546454", "eventUri": "eng-9546454", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-19", "textStart": 359, "textEnd": 367}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

However, what binds them together is their shared suspicion that Taylor Swift is a terrible role model, inspired by radical feminism and dismissive of Christian values. Her eleventh album, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" seems to offer little to dispute this.\n\nWhen \"Poets\" debuted April 19, critics were quick to pounce, calling the work's 31 tracks (yes, you read that number correctly) uninspired, pretentious, and sonically monotonous.\n\nBut the most hot-button accusation making the rounds on X is that Swift's careless use of religious imagery makes the album blasphemous. The most rebuked song, \"Guilty as Sin,\" features Swift confessing lust for a romantic partner with phrases evoking Christ's crucifixion and resurrection: \"What if I roll the stone away? They're gonna crucify me anyway.\"\n\nIn \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived,\" Swift again likens herself to Jesus, singing, \"I would've died for your sins, instead, I just died inside.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Swift has dabbled in Christian imagery. 2019's \"False God\" features Swift using similar language to describe the idolization of a relationship: \"We might just get away with it, the altar is my hips. Even if it's a false god, we'd still worship this love.\" It was during this same time Swift also released her undeniably catchy single \"You Need to Calm Down,\" a dig at \"homophobia.\"\n\nWhile the lyrics don't directly reference Christians, the music video's trailer-park setting clearly means to evoke white \"trailer trash\" and the religious right, the same kind of people Swift began complaining (and sometimes crying) about during her embarrassing political phase that coincided with the release of the Swift documentary \"Miss Americana.\"\n\nThose willing to overlook these outbursts at the time are revisiting them in light of the lyrics on \"Poets.\"\n\nI agree with my fellow Christians and share their disappointment: Parts of this album are indeed blasphemous, and I understand why they offend. At the same time, much of the commentary ignores aspects of the album that are worth discussion and some degree of appreciation, particularly from a conservative perspective.\n\nWhat I find most profound about \"The Tortured Poets Department\" is the honesty with which Swift, 34, reveals what she now desires in life: marriage, babies, and meaning. Pop's most famous serial dater has always sung about love, but on \"loml\" (an acronym for \"love of my life\"), she takes it a step further, lamenting the end of her six-year relationship with actor Joe Alwyn last spring.\n\nSwift seems to blame that breakup on Alwyn's unwillingness to marry and start a family, as evidenced by lines such as, \"You talked me under the table [clean version], talking rings and talking cradles.\" The title track also hints at a marriage that never was: \"At dinner you take my ring off my middle finger and put it on the one people put wedding rings on, and that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding.\"\n\nThe ballad \"So Long, London\" is one of the album's most poignant expressions of this yearning. Opening with haunting a cappella harmonies that evoke wedding bells, the lyrics find Swift bitterly washing her hands of a man who wasted her time: \"I stopped CPR, after all it's no use. The spirit was gone, we would never come to, and I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free.\"\n\nIn another lyric she makes clear what she expected in exchange, lamenting that she \"died on the [wedding] altar waiting for the proof\" of his love. The proof? You guessed it: marriage.\n\nBy the time we hear \"The Prophecy,\" this regret has turned into despair. Is it finally too late to find someone who will choose her forever? \"I'm so afraid I sealed my fate, no sign of soulmates.\"\n\nWhile tracks like \"Peter\" (as in Peter Pan) allow Swift the satisfaction of kicking immature, commitment-averse men to the curb, she doesn't let herself off the hook for her history of heartbreak.\n\nOn \"I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can),\" Swift incisively portrays the deluded optimism of a woman who's convinced herself she can turn her \"project boyfriend\" into husband material. The lyrics of \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart\" subtly undermine the album's only pure upbeat dance anthem, with Swift sarcastically bragging about how easy it is to conceal her misery beneath girl-power bravado.\n\nOf course, not all 31 songs are laments over love lost. \"Clara Bow\" is a touching and personal rebuke of the way the music industry pits younger female artists against older ones, while \"Robin\" is a sweet ode to the young son of The National's Aaron Dessner, who produced the album. The latter track shows Swift doing something she's proven she's good at: writing what she doesn't know. Here she effortlessly channels the emotions of a mother cherishing the whimsy of her little boy's imagination (\"Long may you roar at your dinosaurs, you're a just ruler\") with the bittersweet acceptance that such innocence is necessarily fleeting.\n\nSwift has never been one to downplay the struggles of life in the spotlight, and two songs on \"Poets\" give her the chance to chastise her audience for asking too much of her. The moody ballad \"How Did It End?\" calls out fans for the \"empathetic hunger\" with which they consume and gossip about Swift's breakups.\n\n\"But Daddy I Love Him\" strikes back at Swifties who launched a campaign demanding that Swift do public penance for dating musician Matty Healy once some comments he made on a podcast revealed him as \"bigoted.\" Swift has built a reputation around kindness and generosity to her fans, but these songs are rare glimpses that she may be exhausted by them as well.\n\nWhen it comes to the music on \"Poets,\" it's more evident than ever that Swift could use a break from longtime collaborator and producer Jack Antonoff, who seems to be starting to repeat himself, at least with Swift. The songs produced with Dessner, while beautiful, tend to rely on the same raw, stripped-down sound the duo pioneered on 2020's \"folklore.\" It's always easy to tell who produced which song on \"Poets,\" and that's not really a good thing.\n\nSwift has an undeniable gift for weaving powerful, intimate emotions into her songwriting, a gift often undercut by jarring lapses in taste. A single line can convey a feeling with breathtaking precision, only to be followed by lyrics as dull and awkward as, \"You smoked then ate seven bars of chocolate. We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist.\" While I don't agree with some critics that these juxtapositions are intentional or inspired, I can forgive the occasional goofy line after hearing Swift in top form on tracks \"How Did It End?\" \"The Bolter,\" and \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived.\"\n\nMost forgettable are the two songs very clearly written about Swift's current boyfriend, NFL tight end Travis Kelce (\"The Alchemy\" and \"So High School\"). While these songs are innocent, here Swift mixes silly football references (\"So when I touch down, call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team\") with the idea of finding a love that only happens \"once every few lifetimes.\" The results are tired and repetitive.\n\nIt's worth noting that Swift reserves Christian imagery for the songs in which she grapples with the most important personal matters; she's not out to provoke or shock. Swift may no longer believe, but she was raised a Christian, and it's only natural that she would reach for Christian language in describing her deepest longings. What she admits to wanting - meaning, commitment, children - is what we were all created to want.\n\nIs Swift close to recognizing what it is she really seeks in her restless pursuit of love? Perhaps, one day soon, she'll encounter He who's been waiting for her all along. However you may feel about Swift's music, that's something we can all pray for.", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

During her first show of the European leg, fans were quick to notice the changes Swift made to the show from costume changes to edits to her extensive setlist. When talking to the audience, Swift teased she had a lot in store for her fans that evening.\n\n\"It makes us want to give you all sorts of surprises!\" she hinted.\n\nSince Swift last hit the road, she dropped her 11th album The Tortured Poet's Department. Ahead of the Paris show, Swift's French tour promoter, Arnaud Meersseman, confirmed that the singer was adding some TTPD songs to the show.\n\n\"She's going to include new pieces from her new album,\" he said in an interview with Radio France on Thursday, May 9.\n\nBefore Swift takes the stage for each show, she plays her famous intro that includes a mention of all her albums and eras. Swift updated the mix to include a reference to TTPD.\n\nSongs Cut\n\nWith new songs coming into the three-hour set, it was inevitable that fans would have to say goodbye to some tracks. \"The Archer\" and \"Long Live\" were the first ones to get the ax.\n\nAfter Red, Swift goes into her Speak Now era, which includes a new transition featuring floral images on the screen and her dancers performing a new routine before she sings \"Enchanted.\"", "source": {"uri": "star-telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fort Worth Star-Telegram"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kaitlin_simpson@star-telegram.com", "name": "Kaitlin Simpson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enchanted_(Taylor_Swift_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enchanted (Taylor Swift song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Archer_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Archer (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_Now_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speak Now (song)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Hypnotism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Hypnotism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Shows_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Shows and Events", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events_and_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events and Shows", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/196lmy/picture288437991/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/49c7155b-686e-4571-8615-3c6f63e98063", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546454", "eventUri": "eng-9546454", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 33, "textEnd": 38, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

In the new intro, she's added herself singing, \"Straight from the tortured poets department,\" officially solidifying it as a new era.\n\nMore changes followed. Swift kicked off her Paris concert with the Lover album era, as per usual, but removed \"The Archer\" from the set list. In terms of her onstage ensemble, Swift also debuted a glittering bodysuit in a previously unseen shade of orange.\n\nNext, Swift rolled into the Fearless era, for which she also donned a new outfit. Eagle-eyed sleuths put the pieces together of what's likely going on: Swift has new outfits for every album era aside from Reputation: the only album in her catalogue for which she has not yet released the \"Taylor's Version\" that would allow her to own its masters.\n\nAt previous Eras Tour stops, Swift has always followed up Fearless with songs from her album Evermore, but according to Paris attendees, the pop star has rearranged the order of the show. The Red album section of the concert now follows Fearless, and the Evermore set now falls later in the show, and has been combined with the Folklore era (Evermore and Folklore are sister albums, after all).\n\nFor any pop star worth their salt, switching up a mammoth concert's set list is, strategically, a no-brainer: audiences keep coming back as long as they know they'll be surprised. But because it's Taylor Swift we're talking about, each adjustment clearly feels more monumental than the last to her most loyal devotees.\n\nAfter the Red era, Swift revealed a new intro and choreography for the Speak Now portion of the show, and removed the power ballad \"Long Live\" from the set list.\n\nThe Reputation portion now follows Speak Now, and although Swift is still wearing the same black and red bodysuit she's worn in the past, she's added new snake graphics to that portion of the show.\n\nNext, Swift debuted the new combined set list for Folklore and Evermore, which meant several beloved tracks got the axe. The new set list includes \"Cardigan,\" \"Betty,\" \"Champagne Problems,\" \"August,\" \"Illicit Affairs,\" \"My Tears Ricochet,\" \"Marjorie,\" and \"Willow.\"\n\nThe concert is still ongoing, and one can only imagine what she'll have in store for fans when it comes to her brand new material.

Her Eras tour starts back up this May in Europe, then moves to the United States in October and finishes in Canada this November. Swift's 15th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, came out on April 19 (you can order it now). That means it's likely she'll include songs from that record on her tour as well as hits from 2022's Midnights.\n\nFor many people, Ticketmaster might be the first stop for getting Taylor Swift tickets, since the artist links out to this platform from her official website. Unfortunately, many of the Eras tour shows are already sold out on Ticketmaster, including concert dates in the United States (Miami, New Orleans and Indianapolis). But don't be discouraged -- we've rounded up some other ways to get Eras tour tickets.\n\nTickets are already on sale for the 2024 Eras tour dates in North America and Europe, and are selling out fast. If you want to see Taylor Swift live this year, your best bet is to buy as soon as you find a location, date and price that works for you.\n\nMake no mistake: Taylor Swift tickets aren't cheap. You may find some good deals depending on the venue and how close to the stage you are, but almost any Swift tickets going to set you back anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars.\n\nHer European show prices are vastly different from her North American ones, starting around $250. In all cases, though, don't forget that these list prices will also come with ticket reseller fees added to the final price.\n\nTaylor Swift is playing at multiple venues across Europe, the United States and Canada through the end of the year. She is typically performing at each location anywhere from two to five nights before moving onto the next stop.

Since the record was first announced, fans have wondered if it would get incorporated into the nearly three-and-a-half-hour Eras show, and what songs may get cut or changed to accommodate it.\n\nSpeculation went into overdrive recently when Swift posted a YouTube Short of herself preparing for the tour, and it included what looks like a new mic, set pieces, and choreography -- strongly implying that the first major changes to Eras are imminent.\n\nPreviously, Swift has made small changes to the show here and there, like adding \"Long Live\" to the Speak Now section when that re-recorded album released during the tour or swapping out \"Invisible String\" for the \"The 1\" in the Folklore set in the wake of her breakup with Joe Alwyn. But, adding a whole new era would be the most seismic shift yet, and all eyes are on Paris to see how the songstress does it.\n\nSo, come one, come all, [Eras Tour] is happening again -- and Entertainment Weekly is keeping track of all the changes, below.

The singer also appeared to debut a new orange-tinted bodysuit and matching jacket during the first era.\n\nThe \"Lover\" set used to end with \"The Archer\" and go straight into the \"Fearless\" era, but no more. Now the set ends after \"Lover.\" But the stunning transition with the sparkler effect is still intact.\n\nInstead of \"Fearless\" popping up in the \"Evermore\" era, Swift transitioned to the \"Red\" set -- though the music box mime that previously started the era is still in the show.

We've had requests for Taylor Swift on a stage with a microphone in fondant, Taylor Swift riding a unicorn, Taylor Swift album covers, cakes with her face on them ... The orders are very specific in the details.\"\n\nBeji said her team at the bakery on rue Greneta, near Les Halles shopping mall, were getting into the spirit of things. And as the countdown begins in the French capital to the arrival of the singer's Eras tour on Thursday - her first performance of a three-month European trip - they are not the only ones.\n\nHonor McWilliams, 24, a Swiftie from Glasgow who lives in Paris teaching English at the Sorbonne, can hardly contain her excitement over attending the opening concert at La D\u00e9fense, the first of four long-sold-out gigs on 9-12 May. She will also attend on Saturday with her sister Grace and two friends who are flying in from Glasgow, and will be travelling to Milan for a third concert in July.\n\nAfter previously seeing Swift perform in London, Glasgow, New York and Dublin - and meeting her briefly in London after being picked out of the crowd by Swift's mother - McWilliams has spent a total of \u20ac255 for the Paris tickets and has been babysitting to pay for them. \"To this day my love of Taylor Swift has been a cornerstone of many of my personal, and even professional, relationships,\" she said.\n\n\"I connect so much with the French university students I teach here because of our shared love of Taylor Swift. Each week they'll ask me for my opinion on the latest Taylor Swift news, and I will find any way I can to make reference to her in lessons. One student even termed me the 'Taylor Swift of the Sorbonne', which may very well be the best professional compliment I will ever get.\"\n\nWhat is the core of Swift's appeal? McWilliams cites \"the eloquence of the lyrics in her songs, her work ethic, gravitas, her intelligence and captivating ability to tell stories, connect with others and generate such enthusiasm.\"\n\nSwift's popularity has been a slow burn in France, where she gave her first concert in 2010. There was a touch of Emily in Paris to the official video for Begin Again, a 2012 song from her fourth studio album Red. Shot in Paris, it shows her as the quintessential American in Paris, writing postcards, walking on the Pont des Arts and visiting a patisserie as she meets a handsome stranger who approaches her in a cafe.\n\nShe continued to associate the city with romance. The only concert to promote her 2019 album Lover, a wondrously lovestruck album written amid her relationship with the actor Joe Alwyn, was performed in Paris - a show entitled City of Lover, performed at the relatively intimate Olympia venue. She then wrote a song entitled Paris for her 2023 album Midnights, where Swift, \"so in love that I might stop breathing\", imagines being with her partner in the city. \"I wanna transport you to somewhere the culture's clever\", she sings, adding \"let the only flashing lights be the tower at midnight\" - a reference to the glittering light show put on by the Eiffel Tower.\n\nIt all adds a certain frisson to her tour opener this week, but Prof Linda Bloss-Baum, an assistant director of the business and entertainment programme at American University's Kogod School of Business in Washington, says Swift's arrival is a big deal for any city.\n\n\"It has an incredible economic impact. I know many American people who have opted to take a trip to Europe to see Taylor Swift because the tickets were more affordable. They're making a holiday of it, so it's not just the tickets, it has an economic benefit for the whole city with people staying in hotels, eating in restaurants. The ripple effect with Taylor Swift is amazing, unprecedented.\"\n\nShe added: \"France has always been a bit of an anomaly in terms of the music business, with perhaps a little less appetite for US pop as a genre, but Taylor Swift is an exception. She seems to generate an emotional reaction from people who don't necessarily even speak English but want to be part of the phenomenon. I think what has happened is that, post-Covid pandemic, people are seeking an experience and this is the experience people want this year. It's top of their list. The average concertgoer is not holding back in spending. They're forging a lifetime marker.\"\n\nThe Paris concerts are especially anticipated because they are the first following the release of Swift's enormously successful new album The Tortured Poets Department, which has broken a series of streaming records since its April 19 release. Fans are hoping that she will append material from the album to the Eras setlist.\n\nThe conservative newspaper Le Figaro has even got in on the Swift act with an article advising desperate, ticketless Swifties on how to avoid being ripped off with fake tickets.\n\nThe official price was between \u20ac69.50 and \u20ac245.50 for seats and up to \u20ac827.40 for VIP packages. Warning that resale prices were likely to be higher and could involve counterfeits, the paper warned: \"If you haven't bought your ticket on an official site there's no way to easily verify the authenticity or validity of a ticket.\"\n\nAt Clove Bakery, the team is working flat out to have all their orders ready on time. \"It's incredible, and not what we set out to do when we opened the bakery seven years ago, but it's also a lot of fun for the bakery team who are all young and getting involved in the excitement too,\" Beji said.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType":

Fans suspected she would add music from her new album, which was released April 19, after Swift posted a video clip of her rehearsing with something that looked like a \"TTPD\" logo attached to a railing. The addition of the new album comes as Swift is a little more than halfway through her Eras Tour, which is scheduled to continue through Europe before returning to North America at the end of 2024. The tour is already the highest-grossing tour of all time, grossing $1.04 billion across its first 60 shows, according to Pollstar estimates.\n\nSwift's new album -- which was actually a 31-song double album -- broke countless records after its April release. It became the most-streamed album in a single day and week on Spotify, broke the record for the most sales of a vinyl album in a week and became the top-selling album of the year. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Top 200, and songs from the album held the top 14 spots the week after the album came out on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nWe estimate Swift's net worth to be about $1.1 billion as of Thursday afternoon.

You can often find her with a paperback and an iced coffee during her time off.\n\nTaylor Swift's Tortured Poets era is here, and it's safe to say that fans are being well fed. Swift's newest album The Tortured Poets Department dropped on April 19 -- and then 2 hours later, she dropped another one, The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology. The double album shocker gave fans 31 new songs, including the four bonus tracks that were previously exclusive to the CD variant editions. To wrap up release day, Swift also dropped the music video for the album's lead single, Fortnight featuring Post Malone.\n\nSwift described Tortured Poets on her Instagram as a reflection of \"a fleeting and fatalistic moment in time -- one that was both sensational and sorrowful in equal measure.\" Within its first day of release, Tortured Poets was already breaking records: It was the most streamed album in a single day in 2024, Billboard reports.\n\nRead more: Apple Music vs. Spotify: How to Decide\n\nSwift announced The Tortured Poets Department in February, after winning her 14th Grammy award.

There were some clips of fan favorite moments, but eagle-eyed fans spotted new choreography, microphones, set pieces, guitars and more.\n\nWhile Swift has been mum on the subject, fan speculation was officially confirmed when Swift hit the stage in Paris today. Swift's TTPD Era featured songs But Daddy I Love Him, So High School, Who's Afraid Of Little Old Me, Down Bad, Fortnight, The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived and I Can Do It With A Broken Heart. Swift also updated the set list and said goodbye to fan favorite songs like Long Live, The Archer and more.\n\nYou can stream The Tortured Poets Department on your streaming service of choice.

You can see all the options at Swift's link tree here.\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department has 16 brand-new songs and four variant-specific bonus tracks. Post Malone and Florence & The Machine both appear on the album, and Swift teamed up with long-time friend Jack Antonoff and recent collaborator Aaron Dessner on her latest record.\n\nThis record has several solo writing credits for Swift. My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys and Who's Afraid of Little Old Me were both penned solely by the superstar.

The Manuscript\n\nThe first 16 songs were expected as part of the release of The Tortured Poets, but at 2 a.m. on April 19, Swift surprised fans with a double album release. Songs 17 through 31 make up the second half of The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology.\n\nThere are four confirmed variant editions of TTPD, named after the bonus track each will include: The Bolter, The Albatross, The Black Dog and The Manuscript. While the variants are available for sale on Swift's website, fans can also find them at Target. These do not include the extra 15 songs included in TTPD: The Anthology.\n\nThe majority of the variant editions are available as CDs, including The Bolter, The Albatross and The Black Dog. The fourth variant edition, named after the bonus song The Manuscript, is available as a CD and on vinyl in phantom clear or ghost white colors only at Target. Swift also held preorders for vinyl bundles of the other variant editions (The Bolter, The Albatross and The Black Dog) that included a deluxe CD and cassette, but those were only available until April 12.\n\nIn every social media post that Taylor Swift has made, she includes the same preorder link, which includes other retailers besides her website and Target, like Barnes & Noble. At Target, you can buy each CD individually for $14, and The Manuscript vinyl is $46. There is not currently a place where you can find all four of the bonus songs on the same CD, which is why completists and collectors ought to be prepared to drop some cash.\n\nGood news: As part of the 2 a.m. double album release, the four confirmed bonus songs are included in TTPD: The Anthology. So now you don't need to buy each of the four variant editions on CD and vinyl to listen to The Bolter, The Albatross, The Black Dog and The Manuscript. TTPD: The Anthology is available wherever you stream music.\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology has yet to see a physical release, though there is a digital download available for $15 on Swift's website. So fans and collectors will still need to buy the variant physical copies of the album if you want to hear the four bonus tracks. We'll update this story if Swift releases a physical version of TTPD: The Anthology. You may hear clips of the album on TikTok as Swift recently agreed to allow some of her songs back on the app.\n\nThis isn't how Swift has previously handled bonus song releases. With her last original album Midnights in 2022, she dropped songs in stages: the original album, a 3 a.m. release with seven more songs, then haphazardly released singles on CD and vinyl. There are three versions of the album on streaming, but there still isn't one central album -- on streaming, CD or vinyl -- where you can listen to all of the songs from the Midnights era. So it's safe to say that Swift took the shorter route this tiime.", "source": {"uri": "cnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNET"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Yeah, outside of that, got to eat some lovely Singapore food and just catch the views. Everything over there just seems so nice.\"\n\nSwift was long overdue for a hiatus, as she had shown signs of falling under the weather in Singapore.\n\nThe \"Fortnight\" singer was seen at the time coughing, clearing her throat and trying to catch her breath in-between singing her songs onstage.\n\n\"You can hear a rasphy [sic] tone in her voice, she also seems more calm and reserved in her movements,\" one Swiftie previously observed, adding, \"The show must go on...a queen.\"\n\nIt was rumored that the \"You Belong With Me\" singer was feeling torn about heading back on the international leg of her Eras Tour, with an insider telling Us Weekly that she and her pro athlete beu had \"deepened their bond\" during \"all the time they've spent together recently.\"\n\n\"It makes the prospect of her tour more challenging. She'll be sad,\" the source added.\n\nSwift herself then took to Instagram to reassure her fans that she could not be more excited to resume her tour.\n\n\"I was already so fired up to get back to the tour but you doing THIS??\" the \"Love Story\" singer wrote in April, referencing the success of her new album, \"The Tortured Poets Department.\"\n\nShe added, \"May 9th can't come soon enough.\"\n\nKelce has already confirmed that he will be sure to attend several of Swift's shows in Europe, which run through August before returning to the US.\n\nThe Super Bowl champ -- who is on break from the NFL season -- told \"Entertainment Tonight\" last month, \"Oh, you know I gotta go support.\n\n\"We both love what we do, and any chance that I can show my support to her -- knowing that she has shown me all the support in the world throughout the season -- it's just been an amazing experience getting to know Tay.\"\n\nAlthough Kelce did not reveal exactly which shows he will go to, he hinted, \"I'll tell you what, I think the London shows. I think she's at Wembley [Stadium] eight times? Which is mind-blowing that she can do that many shows in one stadium and fill that thing up.\"\n\nSwift is scheduled to perform at the Paris La D\u00e9fense Arena through Sunday before continuing the international leg of her Eras Tour in Sweden next week.", "source": {"uri": "pagesix.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Page Six"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_La_D\u00e9fense_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris La D\u00e9fense Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Belong_with_Me", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "You Belong with Me"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/taylor-swift-travis.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546454", "eventUri": "eng-9546454", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 2181, "textEnd": 2188}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Who's coming? \ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udfb8\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb #theerastour #4inarow.\"\n\nKelce, 34, was one of the first social media users to respond, commenting, \"LFG!\" which is a common acronym for \"let's f-king go.\"\n\nSwift, also 34, kicked off her Eras Tour in March 2023, which served as the catalyst of her romance with Kelce several months later. When Swift performed in Kansas City the following July, the NFL star attended with the hopes of meeting her backstage and exchanging phone numbers. They were unable to meet, and Kelce recounted the missed connection on an episode of his \"New Heights\" podcast.\n\n\"This all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,\" Swift later recalled during her 2023 TIME Person of the Year profile, noting they \"started hanging out right after that.\"\n\nSwift and Kelce took their relationship public in September 2023 when she went to his Kansas City Chiefs home game against the Chicago Bears.\n\n\"We actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I'm grateful for, because we got to get to know each other,\" she told the outlet. \"By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard-launch a first date.\"\n\nSince then, Swift attended 12 more of Kelce's NFL games including February's Super Bowl LVIII. Kelce returned the favor and has stepped out at several of her Eras shows in between his professional commitments.\n\n\"Taylor's very fond of performing in Australia because of the crowds over there and how into it they get,\" he recalled on his podcast of her March shows. \"Shout-out to Australia for showing up, showing out.\"\n\nSwift had a brief tour hiatus in March and April. During the latter month, she released The Tortured Poets Department and relaxed with Kelce at home and on several vacations. The pop star resumes her tour on Thursday before performing more than 40 shows across Europe and the United Kingdom throughout the summer.\n\nKelce has plans to show his support for Swift during this Eras leg.\n\n\"Man, I'll tell you what. The London shows, I think she's at Wembley eight times, which is mind-blowing that she can do that many shows in one stadium and fill that thing up,\" he told Entertainment Tonight last month, referring to her June and August tour dates. \"I played at Wembley once and I don't even think we filled that thing all the way up.\"", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "miranda_siwak@usmagazine.com", "name": "Miranda Siwak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/65th_Annual_Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "65th Annual Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acronym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Person_of_the_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Time Person of the Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heavy metal music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LVIII", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl LVIII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Travis-Kelce-Says-LFG-to-Taylor-Swift-Eras-Tour-Return-in-Paris-2.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546454", "eventUri": "eng-9546454", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 124, "textEnd": 129}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Seeing her comment on one is even more uncommon. So, you can imagine the reaction the fandom had when she left an A+ compliment on a viral TikTok of a fan hilariously lip-synching to her song \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\" off The Tortured Poets Department.\n\nFollowing the release of Taylor Swift's latest project, The Tortured Poets Department, fans are using her music in incredibly creative ways - like the time one fan made a video of little Ryan Gosling dancing to \"I Can Do It With A Broken Heart\" - to show their love for her while also creating incredibly fun content.\n\nIn the TikTok we're talking about today, @giacomobeub posted a hilarious video of themselves dramatically lip-synching to \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived,\" which is arguably one of the most brutal tracks on TTPD. Check it out:\n\nAt the time of this writing, the video has well over 3 million views. Fans absolutely love this dramatic interpretation of the track which includes the creator using a Nerf gun, throwing a notebook, having their friends drag them away, and even having a cop make a cameo.\n\nTruly, it's fantastic work, and that became a fact when Taylor Swift herself left this comment on the video:\n\nWhat a great compliment! Taylor Swift's music videos are honestly next level, so to have her leave this silly comment on the TikTok is quite the praise. Also, what makes this whole interaction even better is how the creator responded to Swift's incredible compliment.\n\nSince @giacomobeub's TikTok had the drama of a video like \"Look What You Made Me Do,\" I can see why Taylor Swift made her love of it known. It's truly remarkable and hilarious work worthy of the pop star's recognition.\n\nUnderstandably, when @giacomobeub found out that Swift had commented on their video they responded to it by writing in all caps:\n\nThe excitement is wonderful. And what makes matters even better is they very quickly had a T-shirt made with Taylor Swift's A+ compliment on it, because this is for sure something to immortalize.\n\nMuch like the time a TikTok star got the \"22\" hat during the Eras Tour, this creator is living in the moment and basking in the fact that Taylor Swift knows who they are.\n\nAnd who can blame them? There are millions upon millions of videos about Swift on social media -- from kids recreating the Eras Tour at home to A-List celebrities reacting to TTPD PR packages -- this is an oversaturated corner of the internet, and there's no way Taylor Swift can see it all. So, when she does see something like this loving and funny TikTok and acknowledges it, it's a very big deal.\n\nWith the Eras Tour kicking back into high gear this week, we can expect even more A+ Taylor Swift TikToks, and hopefully, that will mean more dramatic reenactments of songs from @giacomobeub.\n\nWe'll be sure to keep you posted if this story develops, and Swift gives this fan a \"22\" hat or acknowledges their videos more. But in the meantime, we should all listen to \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\" on repeat and dance dramatically to it.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [{"uri": "riley_utley@cinemablend.com", "name": "Riley Utley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip_sync", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lip sync"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fandom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_queen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drag queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look_What_You_Made_Me_Do", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Look What You Made Me Do"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_caps", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All caps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Emo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Emo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yaU5iujhGyDEtiAYhbRhQn-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546454", "eventUri": "eng-9546454", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

People and Entertainment Tonight confirmed ahead of the Met Gala that Swift wouldn't be going after Page Six ran a report claiming she could make an appearance.\n\nEntertainment Tonight learned that she decided to skip the gala so she \"can continue preparing for her Eras Tour.\" People also reported that Swift would be \"focusing on rehearsals and tour prep\" rather than attending fashion's big night and its after-parties.\n\nSwift last attended the Met Gala in 2016.

However, Swift appeared well rested taking the stage in Paris after a two-month hiatus from her record-breaking \"Eras\" tour. The pop superstar is back and ready to cause more online chaos. Swift has made some changes to her setlist and costumes, again igniting a firestorm of speculation about her next career move.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\n[RELATED: Every Song on Taylor Swift's 'The Tortured Poets Department' Has Charted on the Billboard Hot 100]\n\nTaylor Swift Fans Are in a Frenzy\n\nIf there's one thing that Swifties know, it's that everything is intentional with the 14-time GRAMMY winner. So if she changed up her setlist and wardrobe, there's a reason.\n\nSo far, Swifties have noted that their queen has cut Lover's \"The Archer\" and Speak Now's \"Long Live\" from the setlist. \"Taylor really said burn the old set list down WHAT IS HAPPENING,\" one dumbfounded Swiftie wrote on X/Twitter.\n\nFans also couldn't help but notice that Swift went straight into the Red era from Fearless -- temporarily skipping over Evermore, Reputation, and Speak Now.\n\nAdditionally, Swift, 34, has so far sported new outfits for every 'Era' -- including a new T-shirt for Red that now reads, \"This is not Taylor's Version.\" For context, Swift began re-recording her first six albums in 2021 as part of an ongoing effort to regain control of her master recordings. Each re-recording has been christened \"(Taylor's Version.)\"\n\nShe has only two albums left to re-release: her self-titled 2006 debut and 2017's Reputation. Swifties have long reached the consensus that Reputation (Taylor's Version) is coming next. Many social media users believe the wardrobe changes confirm this theory.\n\nOf course, some less conspiracy-minded Swifties think there might be a much simpler explanation for the wardrobe change. \"Not everything is an Easter egg,\" one X/Twitter user said. \"It's probably just referencing fans saying 'this is not Taylor's version' when they hear the stolen version.\"\n\nBut where's the fun in that?\n\nWhat Is Lana Del Rey's Favorite Song From 'The Tortured Poets Department?'\n\nMuch like the rest of the world, Lana Del Rey is enjoying The Tortured Poets Department. The \"Born to Die\" singer -- who collaborated with Swift on the track \"Snow on the Beach,\" from the latter's 2022 album Midnights -- recently revealed her favorite song.\n\n\"The one, 'Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?'\" Del Rey told Entertainment Tonight on the Met Gala red carpet.\n\nThe album's 10th track is a defiant response to Swift's various critics throughout her 16-year career.

And one fan in particular really understood the assignment at the pop star's first show back in Paris on Thursday night (May 9), sporting a homemade cape showing off her recent Billboard Hot 100 record.\n\nAs captured in pictures by passerby fans at La Defense in Paris, the unknown Swiftie's cape is so long, it touches the ground. The accessory boasts a screenshot of the Hot 100 chart as it was the week of May 4, 2024, when Swift became the first artist in history to occupy the top 14 spots of the chart.\n\nAll 14 of those songs were from the singer's latest album The Tortured Poets Department, which dropped April 19 and has spent two weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 so far. The LP's lead single \"Fortnight\" featuring Post Malone began at the top of the Hot 100, followed by \"Down Bad,\" \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,\" \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" \"So Long, London,\" \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys,\" \"But Daddy I Love Him, \"Florida!!!,\" \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?,\" \"Guilty as Sin?,\" \"Fresh Out the Slammer,\" \"Loml,\" \"The Alchemy\" and \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived.\"\n\nIn achieving the milestone, Swift broke her own record set with 2022's Midnights, which made her the first artist to ever occupy all of the top 10 simultaneously. (And yes, someone also wore a cape reflecting that accolade to an earlier Eras show.)\n\nThe Paris show follows a two-month pause Swift took from touring to promote and release Tortured Poets.

After a two-month hiatus, the \"Eras Tour\" is returning Thursday when Swift opens a four-night stay at La D\u00e9fense Arena in Paris.\n\nIf Swift's past international shows are any indication, some fans will be wearing a No. 87 Chiefs.\n\nOne reason we might see fans in Kelce's jersey (and perhaps Kelce himself) is because Americans have made Swift's shows in Paris a vacation destination.\n\nParis is ready for Swift and her fans.\n\nBloomberg reported that Swift is in one way going to be a bigger draw than the Summer Olympics, which begin July 26 in Paris.\n\n\"With a total seating capacity of 40,000 per show, the music event is a small fraction of the size of the Olympic Games,\" Bloomberg's Jenny Che wrote of Swift's stop in Paris. \"And yet the concerts are drawing five times as many Americans as the Paris Olympics, according to figures from New York-based luxury travel agency Embark Beyond. For both events, trips would normally be booked many months in advance.\"\n\nWhile speaking on the television program \"Entre Nous,\" reporter Solange Mougin said 90% of the visitors to the Paris Olympics are expected to be from France. So for Americans, it seems Swift is more of a draw than the Summer Games.\n\nMougin added that Paris can expect an economic boost from Swift's shows.\n\n\"There is a Swiftonomics windfall,\" Mougin said. \"There's also a lot of hotel rooms that are booked up. But not all Swifties are booking hotels. There are a whole bunch that have already started camping out in front of the concert venue trying to get in first.\"\n\nKelce in Europe?\n\nParis is the first of 18 European cities in which Swift will play a concert, and Kelce has said he will be making the trip across the pond to see his girlfriend.\n\nThe New York Post reported that Kelce already has booked \"lavish hotel suites, wine tours in Italy and other day trips to the most romantic places.\"\n\nKelce will be at his Kelce Jam music festival on May 18 and then the Chiefs have Organized Team Activities before mandatory minicamp from June 11-13. Training camp will begin in mid-July, so that will give Kelce time to visit Europe, perhaps with teammate Patrick Mahomes.\n\nSwift will play shows in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Switzerland and Italy from mid-June to mid-July. That could be when Kelce arrives in Europe.\n\nThe European leg of the \"Eras Tour\" runs through Aug. 20, then comes a two-month break.

The \"Fortnight\" singer is headed to Europe after a two-month break as she kicks off the European Leg of her Eras Tour on Thursday, May 9, in Paris. She'll stay throughout the weekend.\n\nThough Swift has taken a break from the stage, she's certainly kept busy and released one of her most successful albums to date. \"The Tortured Poets Department\" became the first album in Spotify history to surpass one billion streams in a single week, just five days after its April 19 debut.\n\nShe also occupied all 10 of top 10 spots of the Billboard Hot 100. This wasn't the first time, however. With \"Midnights,\" Swift became the first artist in history to do so. She took it a step further with \"Tortured Poets,\" breaking her own record by becoming the first to claim every slot in the top 14 at once.\n\nThis begs the question: Will Swift add \"TTPD\" as a new era during her European leg of tour? And if so, what will she wear?\n\nSo far, Swift has been teasing Victorian looks in her new album promo as well as in her \"Fortnight\" music video featuring Post Malone. Designer looks have included a black, Elena Velez fall '24 ruffled skirt, a shimmering Celine minidress, and a Khaite cotton maxi dress. This era is much moodier than the glitz of \"Midnight's\" \"Bejeweled\" and \"Karma,\" for instance.\n\nOn tour in 2023, Swift sang through a more than 40-song set list, wearing a standout pair of custom Christian Louboutin knee-high boots. Seen in multiple difference colors, the boots were made of thousands of glittering strass crystals with a sculptural heel and a signature red-bottomed sole.\n\nWe'd love to see Swift step it up a notch and perform hits off \"Tortured Poets\" in another Louboutin shoe: the Tabi in collaboration with Maison Margiela.\n\nThe shoe had a major moment at the 2024 Met Gala, with stars getting the custom treatment. Ariana Grande, for example, performed in a bespoke version of the Tabi leather pumps that were hand-painted in pastels by Louboutin. It's a move Swift could make.\n\nThe designer-duo created six different Tabi shoes, which debuted during John Galliano's Maison Margiela's spring '24 couture show during Paris Fashion Week in January. Each shoe featured Louboutin's signature red sole while embracing Margiela's split-toe silhouette.\n\nThe style's unique design and wearability would add just enough edge and a high-fashion update to Swift's Eras tour costumes.\n\nThe singer will be on tour from May through August, where she finishes with five nights at Wembley Stadium in London.", "source": {"uri": "footwearnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Footwear News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nikara_johns@footwearnews.com", "name": "Nikara Johns", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midnights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billboard Hot 100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bejeweled_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bejeweled (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Post Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotional_recording", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Promotional recording"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Set list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniskirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miniskirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Louboutin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian Louboutin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victorian era"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cotton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maison_Margiela", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maison Margiela"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Galliano", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Galliano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Margiela", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martin Margiela"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silhouette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bespoke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bespoke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_couture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haute couture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariana_Grande", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ariana Grande"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/taylor-swift-eras-tour-boots.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546454", "eventUri": "eng-9546454", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 167, "textEnd": 172}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-19", "textStart": 498, "textEnd": 506}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Her dancers have also been spotted with new props, while Taylor has been seen practicing in the same heels she wears in the 'Fortnight' video.\n\nBut will Taylor cut songs from other eras - perhaps the five songs not in the original theater release of The Eras Tour movie? - or will the already three-hour long show become even longer?\n\nWhere in the set list will the new era be placed - and which of the 31 songs will make it? Perhaps lead single 'Fortnight' or the title track?\n\nOther questions fans have include whether the surprise song section will feature TTPD songs, to give Taylor more opportunity to play the new album live, or if audiences will instead get deep cuts from the past 18 years.\n\nThe first show will be in Paris, France and kicks off at 8pm local time, 7pm GMT, 2pm EST, and 11am PST.\n\nHow to listen to Taylor Swift's Tortured Poets Department?\n\nTaylor Swift's Tortured Poets Department is available on all streaming platforms and physical copies including vinyl, CD and cassette, are available through her website and all good retailers.\n\nDid Taylor Swift drop a second album?\n\nHours after The Tortured Poets Department was released, Taylor Swift shocked fans when she dropped another 15 tracks, completing the \"anthology\" and offering up tracks that took aim at Kim Kardashian and her family, as well as singing about her new love Travis Kelce.\n\n\"It's a 2am surprise: The Tortured Poets Department is a secret DOUBLE album,\" Taylor shared on social media. \"I'd written so much tortured poetry in the past 2 years and wanted to share it all with you, so here's the second installment of TTPD: The Anthology. 15 extra songs.

She was a co-chair of the event that year and wore a silver snakeskin Louis Vuitton minidress with her platinum bob.\n\nAs for Kelce, TMZ reported that the Kansas City tight end had been invited to the gala, but chose not to attend.

The star hasn't attended since 2016, and this year proved particularly tough schedule-wise: The Met Gala took place just three days before the European leg of Swift's Eras tour kicks off in Paris.\n\nBut as any Swiftie will tell you, Swift can make it anywhere, no matter the flight time: She made it to the Super Bowl to support boyfriend Travis Kelce after finishing up a show in Japan the night before. When Anna Wintour was asked about Swift's potential attendance this year, she played coy, saying, \"I hope she comes and enjoys the exhibit.\" Page Six also claimed that Swift would be in attendance, claiming \"a source tells us that Swift will indeed be attending the lavish event.\"\n\nBut multiple outlets, including People and Us Weekly, reported otherwise: Swift would be \"focusing on rehearsals and tour prep,\" per People.\n\nIt's now been eight years since Swift walked the Met's iconic steps. The singer had been a mainstay on the carpet for much of the mid-aughts, attending six times between 2008 and 2016, when she was co-chair. That year's theme was \"Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology.\"\n\nShe opted for a radical haircut -- a bleach blonde shaggy bob -- dark-toned makeup, and a snakeskin-printed silver midi dress designed for her by Louis Vuitton for the occasion.\n\nHer night at the 2016 Met Gala foreshadowed the release of her edgiest album to date, Reputation, the following year. Many fans believe that one of the most popular songs from that album, \"Getaway Car,\" is about her experience with Tom Hiddleston inside the museum that night.", "source": {"uri": "marieclaire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Marie Claire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_x_Machina:_Fashion_in_an_Age_of_Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_cut", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bob cut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Vuitton", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louis Vuitton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hiddleston", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Hiddleston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairstyle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hairstyle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CVpR4X5T2FbTrvgsT5AiBJ-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546454", "eventUri": "eng-9546454", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

The 1989 Era was always Style, Blank Space, Shake It Off, Wildest Dreams, Bad Blood.\n\nThen it's the acoustic section where she usually plays two surprise songs from her extensive back catalogue. One on the guitar, one on piano.\n\nAnd finally, she ends the show with the Midnights Era which gets an extensive setlist consisting of Lavender Haze, Anti-Hero, Midnight Rain, Vigilante Shit, Bejeweled, Mastermind and Karma.\n\nSO, WHAT'S CHANGED?\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department has been added as an era, with a shake-up to the whole show as a result.\n\nWhen Swift appeared on the stage in Paris, the first big change fans noticed was she had swapped her iconic pink bodysuit for an orange version. Lots of costume changes followed, with new outfits for Fearless and the Speak Now eras too.\n\nSetlist-wise, the first couple of songs remained the same, but it soon became apparent changed was afoot as some songs had been cut from the setlist, and she then began to switch around the order of the eras.\n\nIf we go by Paris, fans in Dublin can now expect Lover followed by the Fearless era, then Red, Speak Now, Reputation, a combination of the Folklore / Evermore eras, 1989... and drumroll please....a brand new The Tortured Poets Department Era, and finally, Midnights.\n\nTHE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT ERA\n\nAs expected, Swift has added The Tortured Poets Department as a brand new era to the already three-hour long show which catalogues ten studio albums.\n\nThe new era kicked off with But Daddy I Love Him followed by Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?. Next up was So High School which is believed to be about her American football superstar boyfriend Travis Kelce.\n\nA mash-up of Down Bad and Fortnight came next, with The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived, a cutting track believed to be about Matty Healy, rounding up proceedings.\n\nJust kidding! Of course she also added I Can Do It With a Broken Heart, a song about smashing it on tour while, you guessed it, being broken-hearted.\n\nTHE SONGS THAT DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT\n\nAlas, at an already three-hour long show, the addition of The Tortured Poets Department Era means she's had to cull other sections of the show.\n\nSo what songs didn't make the cut? Here's each era and the cuts Swift has made from her three-hour long setlist.\n\nRed: No cuts, but a new t-shirt that says \"This IS NOT Taylor's version\". No doubt fans will be diving into what this means....\n\nSpeak Now: Long Live, a firm fan favourite, is gone, meaning this writer's favourite album has been reduced to one song (sob).\n\nReputation: No cuts Folklore/ Evermore: Fans of Taylor's folkier turns on these two albums, released closely together in 2020, will be disappointed.

The tick, tick, tick of love bombs. My view of pitch-black ink. All's fair in love and poetry ... Sincerely, The Chairman of the Tortured Poets Department.\"\n\nAfter the album was released in April 2024, Swift surprised fans hours later by releasing 15 more songs.\n\n\"It's a 2 am surprise: The Tortured Poets Department is a secret DOUBLE album,\" she wrote via social media. \"I'd written so much tortured poetry in the past 2 years and wanted to share it all with you, so here's the second installment of TTPD: The Anthology. 15 extra songs. And now the story isn't mine anymore ... it's all yours.\"\n\nKeep reading to see which TTPD songs Swift's friends are loving the most.\n\nWitherspoon named her top three songs off Swift's 11th studio album shortly after its release, revealing via her Instagram Story that her favorites were \"So Long, London,\" \"Guilty as Sin?\" and \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.\"\n\nTeller, who is one of Swift's closest friends, posted a video via TikTok in April 2024 in which she was listening to \"So Long, London,\" adding in the caption, \"I founded the club she's heard [great] things about. What's everyone's favorite song and why?\"\n\nAfter a fan commented, \"'I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,'\" Teller replied, \"As a friend, this one hurts so much. She goes on stage sad or happy. It's so incredible.\"\n\nWhile speaking to Entertainment Tonight at the Met Gala in May 2024, the \"Summertime Sadness\" singer told the outlet that her favorite track is \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?\"\n\n\"It's beautiful,\" she added.\n\nTurner - who crashed at Swift's Tribeca home after her separation from Joe Jonas following four years of marriage - posted a screenshot of her favorite jam, \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?\" via her Instagram Story.\n\n(Swift and Jonas briefly dated for about three months in 2008, but he famously broke up with her in a 27-second phone call.)\n\nAntonoff, who along with The National frontman Aaron Dessner produced and cowrote TTPD, said via Instagram that his top moment from working on the album was \"the day we made 'Down Bad.'\"\n\nHe added, \"My favorite work we have made together / made in the most wild unhinged moment. All the pain distilled in this album and all the laughter that came out of it. Will hold those days in the studio forever as the most inspiring of my life. I adore this album and the way it came together. TTPD FOREVER.\"\n\nMaya, a longtime Swiftie who turned dad Ethan into a fan, revealed two of her favorite songs via her Instagram Story: \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart\" and \"But Daddy I Love Him,\" the latter of which she captioned, \"What the heck this is sooo good.\"\n\nHe added, \"For Josh and I, we laughed ourselves silly the whole day. We felt like the biggest rock stars in the world.\"\n\nThe Paramore frontwoman - who has been friends with Swift since their early days in the Nashville music scene - praised the second part of the double album via Instagram after its release. (Paramore joined Swift for a brief stint on her Eras Tour in 2023 and will join her on the European leg of her tour from May to August 2024.)\n\n\"The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology. Had me from the storytelling alone, my friend,\" Williams wrote. \"Every one of us knows this kind of grief! It's so impressive to me how specific and colorful Taylor's words get without ever losing the universal thread.

Her custom Versace bodysuit featured bright orange crystals and hot pink sequins. Similar to the other versions of her bodysuit, it was finished with a scoop neck and thin straps. Swift paired the getup with matching sparkly orange and pink knee-high boots, similar to the silver Christian Louboutin kicks she wears at every show.\n\nThe orange hue made some fans wonder whether Swift was subtly confirming a long-running theory about a potential follow-up to Reputation that would have been represented by the same color. In her \"The Man\" music video, which was released in 2020, she spray-painted \"Karma\" on a wall featuring all of her other album titles twice, making fans speculate about the word's significance . At the end of the original Eras Tour setlist -- which concluded with her 2022 song \"Karma\" -- an orange door appears on stage, again connecting the fan theories.\n\n(Swift's Reputation gives multiple nods to her feud with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West after the rapper called her a \"bitch\" in his 2016 song \"Famous,\" which his then-wife claimed Swift approved. Footage released of the alleged phone call was later proven to be altered.)\n\nWhen Swift moved to her Fearless era on Thursday, she gave fans a blast from the past when she donned a Roberto Cavalli frock featuring silver and black beaded fringe. Swift first rocked a nearly identical design on her Fearless tour back in 2009.

Taylor Swift returned to the stage in Paris on Thursday, May 9, and added some tracks from her 11th album to the show.\n\nBefore the TTPD set, Taylor, 34, made several changes to the setlist to account for the new additions. In the Lover set, she cut the song \"The Archer,\" while also debuting a brand new orange bodysuit and sparkly blazer. The Fearless set stayed the same, although it included a new black and gold dress. Rather than segueing into the Evermore set after Fearless, the singer skipped ahead to the Red era, which kept the same songs, but also featured some new costumes.\n\nThe Speak Now era came next, along with a completely revamped introduction and dress. She also cut \"Long Live\" from the set after previously adding it following the release of Speak Now (Taylor's Version) in July 2023. Reputation followed Speak Now, keeping its original outfit and song choices from the first leg of the tour.\n\nFollowing Reputation, there was a new transition into Folklore, where she rocked a new yellow dress and started the set with \"Cardigan,\" which used to be toward the end of the segment. However, Taylor revealed that the Folklore set was actually being combined with Evermore, as she went on to switch back-and-forth between both albums. Unfortunately, this meant a lot of songs were cut from the sister albums: \"'Tis the Damn Season,\" \"The Last Great American Dynasty,\" \"The 1,\" and \"Tolerate It\" all didn't make the cut.\n\nAs usual, Folklore transitioned into 1989, where Taylor wore a mismatched skirt and top for the first time. All of the songs remained the same.\n\nTaylor released TTPD on April 19 while the Eras tour was on a two-month break. However, fans began speculating that some of the tracks would make their way onto the show's setlist after the pop star posted behind-the-scenes rehearsal footage on YouTube on April 25. In the clips, Taylor appeared to be using a microphone that she doesn't normally use during the concert. Some fans also thought they spotted a TTPD logo in the background of one video, while other footage showed dancers using never-before-seen props.\n\nThe Eras tour began in March 2023 with a United States leg that lasted throughout the summer. Taylor then traveled for international shows in August 2023 and November 2023, as well as throughout February and the beginning of March. The four Paris shows are the kickoff to the tour's European leg, which concludes on August 20 in London.\n\nIn October and the beginning of November, the pop star has a string of shows in Miami, Florida, New Orleans, Louisiana, and Indianapolis, Indiana, before heading to Canada to close out the year.\n\nIn April, Taylor's boyfriend, Travis Kelce, confirmed that he would be heading to Europe to \"support\" her on tour this summer. However, football will be in-season by the time she's back in the United States. The couple has already made their romance last throughout one season of football and touring overlapping.\n\nThe Eras tour actually helped Taylor and Travis, 34, get together, as he attended one of the stops in Kansas City in July 2023. After the show, the NFL star gave Taylor a shout-out on his podcast, which led to her reaching out to him. They quietly dated for several weeks before going public with their relationship in September 2023.\n\n\"This all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,\" Taylor told Time magazine in December 2023. \"We started hanging out right after that. So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I'm grateful for, because we got to know each other.\"\n\nAlthough the two have managed to maintain a certain level of privacy, they also haven't shied away from the public frenzy surrounding their romance. \"When you say a relationship is public, that means I'm going to see him do what he loves. We're showing up for each other,\" the Grammy winner explained. \"Other people are there and we don't care. The opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you're seeing someone. And we're just proud of each other.\"", "source": {"uri": "lifeandstylemag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Life & Style"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alyssa_norwin@lifeandstylemag.com", "name": "Alyssa

Over the last day, new photos have surfaced on social media revealing two more of her going out looks. Swift opted for minidresses, wearing two black off-the-shoulder styles.\n\nOn Friday, she wore the first look: a long-sleeve minidress with an A-line skirt. Her hair was styled half up, half down, and she finished her outfit off with black stilettos. She held hands with Kelce in footage that an eyewitness shared on Instagram. See the post here.\n\nA source told Entertainment Tonight on April 29 that Swift and Kelce had gone to Easy's Cocktail lounge inside ARIA Resort and Casino. \"The pair kept a low profile as they held hands and danced to various hits, including a few of Taylor's that were played inside,\" the insider said. \"The two didn't leave each other's side, and were seen with smiles on their faces.\"\n\nSwift and Kelce also had dinner at Noble 33's Toca Madera restaurant and posed with its director of hospitality, Sacha Tanha, during the trip. Swift had her hair up in a bun and wore a $3,030 black Ala\u00efa minidress. For beauty, she did her statement red lip and a smokey cat eye.\n\nSwift will resume her Eras Tour on May 9 in Paris, giving her and Kelce one last weekend to spend together during her break. Us Weekly reported that they will be out at the F1 Miami Grand Prix with Patrick and Brittany Mahomes. Neither Swift nor Kelce have confirmed those plans themselves.\n\nSwift did speak to Time in December about being more comfortable living her life publicly. \"Over the years, I've learned I don't have the time or bandwidth to get pressed about things that don't matter,\" Swift said. \"Yes, if I go out to dinner, there's going to be a whole chaotic situation outside the restaurant. But I still want to go to dinner with my friends. Life is short. Have adventures. Me locking myself away in my house for a lot of years -- I'll never get that time back. I'm more trusting now than I was six years ago.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniskirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miniskirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearst_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hearst Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-line_(clothing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A-line (clothing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Recording_Industry_Association", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Recording Industry Association"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiletto_heel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stiletto heel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bun_(hairstyle)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bun (hairstyle)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brittany"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brittany"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Beauty", "label": "dmoz/Health/Beauty", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Casinos", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Casinos", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Beauty/Hair", "label": "dmoz/Health/Beauty/Hair", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bms7OScYOpzu7.aELbpf6Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/hearst_womens_health_52/62857d91a423debd4c0b421f0a5c4f0e", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546454", "eventUri": "eng-9546454", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 706, "textEnd": 714}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 1351, "textEnd": 1356}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

Alas, it was the fan-favorite \"I Can Do It with a Broken Heart\" that marked the end of the TTPD era of the setlist.\n\nAt her Paris show, Swift opened with the Lover section -- but skipped \"The Archer.\" From there, the Grammy winner went into Fearless followed by Red, performing the sections in a different order than during the previous tour legs. Another nod to the setlist switch-ups? Swift sported a t-shirt that read, \"This Is Not Taylor's Version,\" while performing \"22.\"\n\nNext came the Speak Now section, but she removed \"Long Live,\" which was initially added following the July 2023 release of the album's rerecorded Taylor's Version.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Hero_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Hero (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America_certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recording Industry Association of America certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotpants", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hotpants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Hollywood_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Classical Hollywood cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Archer_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Archer (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_Now_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speak Now (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fearless_(Taylor_Swift_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fearless (Taylor Swift song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Bow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clara Bow"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/MHz7sUHVBxPGqIV01NHjbDp3BWY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1077x151:1079x153)/Taylor-swift-paris-tout-050924-2-a343df968b134fefa1cea04fe6ead8c6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546454", "eventUri": "eng-9546454", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 73, "textEnd": 78}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

her latest album, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" to the already-sprawling setlist, the superstar treated lucky ticket holders to some fresh fashion, too.\n\nSwift performed new tunes \"But Daddy I Love Him,\" \"So High School,\" \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?,\" \"Down Bad\" and \"Fortnight\" wearing a cream-colored dress with a corseted bodice, dramatic hip detailing and her own lyrics scrawled down the skirt.\n\nShe topped it off with a matching white trench coat before launching into \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\" -- and then opted for an on-stage costume change, stripping down to a sparkling black bra top and briefs and adding a gold lam\u00e9 jacket for the grand finale of the \"TTPD\" section, \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.\"\n\nThe new costumes are perfectly in line with the literature-inspired looks she's been exploring while promoting \"TTPD\" -- think corsets, pleated skirts and plenty of black and white.\n\n\"There's definitely a 'literary academia' style that's going on,\" Taylor Swift Style blogger Sarah Chapelle told Page Six Style last month. \"The [visuals] are telling a very cohesive story, which is clearly pointing to being inspired by female poets of the past.\"\n\nThe \"But Daddy I Love Him\" hitmaker collaborated with a number of major fashion houses on her stage styles for the Eras Tour, all of which are inspired by her past album aesthetics.\n\nStandouts include the bedazzled Atelier Versace bodysuits Swift wears during the \"Lover\" section of her performance, the sparkling Roberto Cavalli crop-top-and-miniskirt combos she sports for the \"1989\" segment and the flowing, fluttering Alberta Ferretti gowns that add ethereal drama to the \"Folklore\" portion of the show.\n\nAnd given that the aforementioned brands provided several different color variations of each look for Swift to rotate between as her tour rolls on, additional \"TTPD\" costumes are practically guaranteed to pop up at the shows ahead.",

He realized how cool of a person she was -- and she is -- and so for us, there were a couple of jokes here and there at the beginning.\"\n\nMahomes added, \"She's part of the team.\"\n\nAfter Swift went to her first game -- which Kelce kept quiet until the pop star walked through Arrowhead Stadium in time for kickoff -- she had a chance to bond with the NFL team.\n\nKeep scrolling for all of the athletes' candid quotes about meeting Swift:\n\nKelce first expressed interest in Swift in July 2023, noting on his \"New Heights\" podcast that he felt \"butthurt\" that the pop star allegedly didn't want to meet during her Kansas City Eras Tour show. Upon the podcast episode's release, Swift privately got in touch with Kelce and they started dating.\n\n\"Being around her, seeing how smart Taylor is, has been f -- ing mind-blowing. I'm learning every day,\" Kelce later told WSJ. Magazine in November 2023. \"Obviously, I've never dated anyone with that kind of aura about them ... I've never dealt with it. But at the same time, I'm not running away from any of it.\"\n\nTwo days before Swift arrived at Arrowhead for her debut game day appearance, Kelce \"calmly\" informed Mahomes of the plan.\n\n\"He told me at, like, the last minute. There are some things with Trav where he, kind of, just says it and you don't know if it's true or not,\" Mahomes joked in a postgame press conference. \"Friday, he was just like, 'Ah, yeah, I think she's coming to the game ... this weekend' and moved about his business. ... That's just Travis.\"\n\nWhen Swift watched the game from a private suite with Kelce's loved ones, he was seen giggling and waving in her general direction on the field with Mahomes. After the game, Mahomes had a chance to meet Swift.\n\n\"Taylor's probably the most down-to-earth person that's been on that stage for that long,\" he told TIME in April 2024. \"Even when she's talking about football, when she's learning it, you can see her business mind putting it together. It's almost like she's trying to become a coach. 'Why can't you try this, this, and this?' She's asking the right questions.\"\n\n\"My first response was, 'That's pretty cool,' so I walked up to Trav in the game and we were on the sideline and I just said, 'Hey man, that's cool she's here,'\" the Chiefs long snapper said on the \"Like a Farmer\" podcast in May 2024. \"He's like, 'Wait, what do you mean? Did they put her up on the Jumbotron or something?' \"[I told Travis], 'Jay [White, our equipment manager] just told me right there. That's awesome, man, good for you.' He's just kind of smiling, like, kind of blushing.\"\n\nAfter the game, Winchester was able to meet Swift and realized how much of a \"genuine person\" she is.\n\n\"Later that night, [we] got to meet her and the first thing she said [was], 'Hey, you're the guys with the cute kids, because we had my son and daughter out on the field,\" he recalled. \"I'm like, 'Dang, I think I just became a T. Swift fan.\"\n\nLinebacker Tranquill revealed on the \"Zach Gelb Show\" in January 2024 that the entire team enjoys teasing Kelce about his girlfriend.\n\n\"They've got really, really something going and we enjoy having her at our games,\" Tranquill noted. \"It brings a lot of energy and a lot of fun to our fans. And so that's good for business, good for football and good for the NFL.\"\n\n\"I've seen her, but I didn't go up to her like, 'Can I get a picture?' or nothing like that,\" the wide receiver said on the \"Airing It Out\" podcast in December 2023. \"[I] wouldn't go up to another dude's girl. Maybe if my girl was there I would be like, 'Can we get a picture with the girls together?' or something.\"\n\nAfter the Chiefs defeated the Los Angeles Chargers in October 2023, Swift and Kelce celebrated with other KC athletes and their partners. Hardman's girlfriend, Chariah Gordon, posted a pic on Instagram of the foursome in which Swift kissed Kelce's cheek.\n\nHardman later caught the game-winning pass in the February 2024 Super Bowl -- and Swift personally congratulated him on the honor.\n\n\"She was like... 'Good job, proud of you, good game -- man, it was crazy,'\" he said on \"The Pivot\" podcast later that month, noting Swift called his hands \"magical\" for making the impressive catch.\n\nThe Chiefs head coach approves of Kelce's romance, making it clear that he met Swift many years before the tight end.\n\n\"I knew her from Philadelphia. Her dad was a big NFL fan,\" Reid said on The OutKick's \"The Five Spot\" podcast in October 2023. \"I had met her when she was real young, and her dad. ... She's a good girl, she's into it. We're glad she's here.\"\n\n\"She's just as sweet as she can be,\" the Chiefs owner said on CNBC's Mad Money in January 2024, nothing he met the Grammy winner after one of her game day appearances. \"I also got to see her play here [at our Arrowhead Stadium] twice this past summer and what an incredible performer. I mean, just one of the most incredible artists of our time.\"", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "miranda_siwak@usmagazine.com", "name": "Miranda Siwak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Mornings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS Mornings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickoff_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kickoff (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arrowhead Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumbotron", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jumbotron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_snapper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Long snapper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hispanic_whites", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-Hispanic whites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Chargers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mad Money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winchester, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winchester, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Everything-Kansas-City-Chiefs-Stars-Have-Said-About-Meeting-Taylor-Swift-Since-Travis-Kelce-Romance-01z.jpg?crop=0px%2C33px%2C1998px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546454", "eventUri": "eng-9546454", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

The global icon has made a career out of writing personal lyrics about her life and romances and setting them to music. Fans can't seem to get enough of the singer. She is currently selling out dates on her Eras tour left and right. Swift has also amassed a huge fanbase, who call themselves Swifties. Those fans are ride or die for the singer. This week, it was revealed that one doctor is diagnosing the singer with Autism after researching her life, work, and habits. Of course, her fans have plenty to say about that.\n\nAccording to The Things, Dr. Kim Gillbee, PhD is opening up about Swift's behavior, claiming that the singer is \"likely autistic.\" Gillbee researched the singer's public behavior, dating history, and songs to come to this conclusion. Meanwhile,tThe doctor even went as far as to hypothesize that the singer wouldn't have the successful career that she does today if she had gotten help for her possible issues.\n\n\"Now, through my training and working with people for so many years, I've developed a pretty good bulls**t meter,\" said Gillbee before listing three controversial opinions about Taylor Swift. \"Although not possible to diagnose anyone without a proper assessment, my impression, based on clinical experience, is that Taylor is likely on the autism spectrum.\"\n\nDr. Gillbee went on to explain that Swift often seems to exhibit signs of hyper focus as well as a \"childlike quality.\" The drive to achieve her career goals as well as find the perfect romantic partner is credited for helping form Gillbee's opinions.\n\n\"[Swift] has relentlessly pursued her goal of making it as a country singer. Her music also suggests that boys and dating are a particular hyper focus within Taylor's life,\" the doctor stated.\n\nMeanwhile, Taylor Swift fans have spoken out about the online health diagnosis by a doctor who hasn't treated the singer. \"Saying Taylor has autistic traits is wildly offensive and invasive,\" one person tweeted. However, others tend to agree with the opinions of Dr. Gillbee. \"Taylor Swift is also probably autistic,\" one comment read.\n\nIt clearly doesn't matter to fans what issues Swift may or may not have. She's become an icon to millions around the world. However, fans love her songs and support her for who she is and what she does.", "source": {"uri": "thenerdstash.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nerd Stash"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amanda_lynne@thenerdstash.com", "name": "Amanda Lynne", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Autism spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chivalric_romance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chivalric romance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medical diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://media.thenerdstash.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/taylor-swift.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546454", "eventUri": "eng-9546454", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

Swift is a marketing powerhouse, consistently reaching new heights, while catapulting affiliated brands into the spotlight as well.\n\nThe recent Super Bowl in Las Vegas is a case in point. Swift attended the game in support of her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, who plays for the Kansas City Chiefs. The Super Bowl is famously one of the world's biggest sporting spectacles, yet it was Swift's presence, not the game itself, that has been credited for a surge in Australian TV ratings. It was also the most-watched event in US TV history with more than 123 million viewers.\n\nSwift is a masterful marketer. She plays the long game and has an incredible ability to create an engaging, mysterious and sophisticated fan-experience ecosystem, all the while taking advantage of some key psychological principles of behavioural economics.\n\nBuilding a mystery\n\nWhile many brands define engagement by social media reactions and comments, Swift consistently demonstrates how to go beyond basic fan engagement to deliver major experiences with far-reaching talkability.\n\nConsider the Grammy Awards earlier this month. Swift made history, claiming the Best Album gong for a record fourth time, but she had already taken control of the narrative, making the surprise announcement that her 11th studio album was en route while accepting an earlier award.\n\nTo some devoted fans, this wasn't such a surprise. Swift had dropped a few so-called 'easter eggs' - a term used to describe hidden messages strategically placed in (usually) electronic media - in the lead up to the announcement.\n\nThis strategy taps into a well-known psychological principle of behavioural economics known as the 'curiosity gap', which refers to the gap between what we know and what we desire to know.\n\nThe curiosity gap posits that individuals are more likely to register and recall incomplete or interrupted information than fully provided details. The act of filling these gaps serves as an incentive for people to stay engaged, potentially fostering prolonged interest.\n\nThese unravelling mysteries encourage continuous interpretation and speculation among her audience. Through this journey of exploration and discovery, fans are inclined to delve further, rewatching and relistening to her music to seek verification of their theories.\n\nShe plays the long game and has an incredible ability to create an engaging, mysterious and sophisticated fan-experience ecosystem.\n\nThis isn't a new addition to Swift's bag of tricks. Take her 2012 studio album Red, for example. Fans have pored over the liner notes to decode the messages hidden in uppercase letters among the otherwise lowercase text. One such message, hidden in the lyrics to 'All Too Well', is 'maple latte', which fans eventually traced back to a coffee date she shared with Hollywood star Jake Gyllenhall in 2010. There are said to be 16 hidden messages in these liner notes alone.\n\nMaking the most of merch\n\nShe is yet to take the stage, but the queue for Eras Tour merchandise in Sydney is already snaking around Accor Stadium. Swift's approach to merchandise transcends merely selling products or capitalising on the success of her albums for increased revenue. Instead, it serves to extend the experience of her brand.\n\nFrom themed merchandise that aligns with the thematic aspects of her albums to personalised items featuring her handwriting, Swift's strategy enhances her connection with fans by offering them a tangible piece of her story.\n\nFor instance, Red merchandise included a replica of a ring she wore in one of the song's music videos. Then there are the puzzle sets that offer new insights into her albums thanks to concealed messages, or easter eggs, incorporated in the designs.\n\nSwift also applies the 'scarcity' principle by releasing exclusive and limited-edition merchandise, creating a sense of urgency and compelling fans to purchase quickly before they miss out.\n\nTogether, these strategies have fostered a sense of belonging and shared passion among her devotees, known as Swifties, who enjoy the resulting connectedness.\n\nKiss of visibility\n\nBack to the Super Bowl, where Swift wore a black corset by Australian fashion designer Dion Lee. This was no accident. Swift's Eras Tour kicked off in Australia just days after the NFL's crowing game and this fashion choice was a signal to her curious fans that she had her sights set on the visit. Local cues like this also help boost Swift's brand relevance on the ground.\n\nNot surprisingly, the corset sold out in just a few days. It is currently available to pre-order.\n\nPerfect fit: Swift wore Dion Lee at the Super Bowl, which gave the Australian designer priceless global exposure.\n\nFor Dion Lee, this is a brush with what I call the 'kiss of visibility'. By association, the brand enjoyed a moment of glory, which will continue while the hype surrounding Swift's Australian tour does.\n\nBrands need not wait to be 'kissed' by the Swift marketing juggernaut. Plenty of businesses take it upon themselves to capitalise on the phenomenon through event-driven branding. Take the beloved Australian biscuit brand, Tim Tam, which this week released a Swift-inspired giveaway and a special-edition 'Tay Tam'.\n\nSuch is her pull, even the US Democratic Party is rumoured to be looking at ways to hitch their wagon to Swift ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Perhaps she should run for President.\n\nDr Abas Mirzaei is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Marketing, Macquarie Business School.\n\n/Public Release.

We spoke with several small businesses about the \u201cSwift Effect\u201d; aka her ability to sell out items and spark big business for small brands she wears. One brand, Wove Made, said they saw a 2,000 per cent increase in sales when Swift was spotted wearing a custom bracelet to a Chiefs game.\n\nWhile Swift is now a billionaire, you can still find a surprising number of affordable brands in the singer\u2019s wardrobe. Sarah Chapelle, the fashion reporter behind Taylor Swift Style (which was the first to identify most of the pieces named in this article) told us that one of Swift\u2019s signature style choices is pairing designer pieces with items from accessible retailers. \u201cThis kind of approach really underlines her approachable, relatable image,\u201d Chapelle said.\n\nBelow are eight affordable items that Swift has been spotted wearing recently.1. A US$40 Halara skirt and a hat supporting Travis Kelce\u2019s podcast\n\nMost recently, Swift was seen in the crowd at Coachella wearing a skirt from Halara that costs less than US$50.\n\nSwift and her boyfriend Travis Kelce recently attended Coachella to cheer on several of their performer friends, including Ice Spice and Jack Antonoff. Taylor was spotted in the crowd wearing a US$40 mini skirt from Halara with a buckle garter detail. She paired the skirt with a hat supporting Kelce\u2019s podcast New Heights, which quickly sold out.2. Under US$100 jewellery from Mazin Jewels\n\nSwift has been spotted wearing Mazin Jewels numerous times in the past few months, including out and about in New York City in October 2023.\n\nSwift has an extensive jewellery collection that spans an impressive price range \u2013 from pieces that cost tens of thousands of dollars, to several affordable items from brands such as Mazin Jewels and Awe Inspired. She\u2019s been seen wearing pieces from Mazin at least half a dozen times in the past year, including at her 34th birthday party.3. A US$150 Aritzia minidress\n\nSwift wore the Aritzia Sunday Best Trix Dress out to dinner with Blake Lively in September 2023.\n\nAccording to Aritzia, the Sunday Best Trix Dress is also known as the \u201cTaylor Swift\u201d dress because of its popularity after the singer was spotted wearing it.4. Never-rip tights from Sheertex (and a US$10 pair from Calzedonia)\n\nSwift has been spotted in Sheertex tights numerous times over the winter months, including out in New York City in December 2023.\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love rip-proof tights? Swift is among the many fans of Sheertex, a brand making durable, comfortable tights. She\u2019s been seen wearing the brand\u2019s diamond pattern tights several times, including out to dinner in New York and at Chiefs games. She\u2019s also been spotted in a US$10 pair of tights from Calzedonia.5. Sub-US$100 Lululemon leggings\n\nSwift paired Lululemon\u2019s Wunder Train leggings with a pair of Adidas x Ivy Park trainers while out in New York earlier this year.\n\nSwift is rarely pictured in athleisure, but when she is, she\u2019s often wearing Lululemon. The leggings pictured above come in numerous lengths, and Swift is wearing the 70cm (28 inch) pair to accommodate her tall frame.6. Skorts from Free People\n\nSwift wore Free People\u2019s Emmy Denim Skort out in New York City on June 27, 2023.\n\nSwift is a big fan of Free People\u2019s skorts, and has been seen in a number of the brand\u2019s styles, including the Emmy Denim Skort pictured above and its Heartbreaker Skort.7. A US$70 crushed velvet dress from a small UK business\n\nSmall business Little Lies met its monthly sales goal in a single day after Swift was seen wearing its Sweet Jane Crushed Mini.\n\nSwift wore this crushed velvet dress by the small UK brand Little Lies while out to dinner with Lively in 2023. The dress is currently sold out, but you can sign up to be notified when it\u2019s back in stock.8. A US$60 skort from Popflex\n\nAside from the juicy insights we\u2019re getting from her new album The Tortured Poet\u2019s Society, Swift also gives us glimpses into her life through her YouTube shorts and Tik Tok videos.\n\nIn one video she posted last month, Swift can be seen showing off her pickleball skills in an adorable US$60 Lavender Pirouette Skort by Popflex. The size-inclusive exercise skirt is available in 11 colours and sizes XXS to 3X. The skort is currently sold out but fans can easily pre-order through Popflex\u2019s website.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Business Insider.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coachella_(festival)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coachella (festival)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniskirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miniskirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Spice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ice Spice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lululemon_Athletica", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lululemon Athletica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Skirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leggings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leggings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jewellery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sneakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aritzia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aritzia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticketmaster", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ticketmaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Small business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivy League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skort", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Antonoff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Antonoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buckle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Lively", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blake Lively"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Knitting_and_Crochet", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Knitting and Crochet", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/08/e2eef637-c667-46f6-934f-e7d7f6e7a008_ccf86fbc.jpg?itok=NjEKqr49", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546454", "eventUri": "eng-9546454", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

But do they rank in this list of her best duets? Find out below.\n\nExile (Taylor Swift featuring Bon Iver, 2020)\n\nFrom those opening piano chords, it's immediately clear that Exile is something special. \"I think I've seen this film before, and I didn't like the ending,\" Bon Iver's Justin Vernon and Taylor sigh after alternate verses, before they eventually play out the two sides of a break-up in counterpoint.\n\nEverything Has Changed (Taylor Swift featuring Ed Sheeran, 2013)\n\nWhat happens when two of the most wildly successful musicians of recent years, who also happen to be genuinely good pals, team up to write a song... on a trampoline? Answer: Everything Has Changed, a lovely guitar ballad that plays to both Taylor and Ed's strengths, and builds in emotional heft as the track goes on. The video, naturally, features two mini-me child actors.\n\nBreathe (Taylor Swift featuring Colbie Caillat, 2008)\n\nThis team-up with fellow Nashville artist Colbie Caillat is a classic early Taylor break-up ballad. Caillat's understated backing vocals complement Taylor's well, the lyrics have Taylor's usual flashes of perception and the \"it's 2am, feeling like I just lost a friend\" bridge shifts things up a gear in dramatic fashion.\n\nThe Joker and the Queen (Ed Sheeran featuring Taylor Swift, 2022)\n\nA de facto sequel to Everything Has Changed (they've recorded two other tracks in between, but they recruited the lookalikes from that video, now in their late teens, to reprise their roles for this one), this is a simple track, decked out with some soaring strings, but both Taylor and Ed are on form; Taylor's vocals are especially rich.\n\nNo Body, No Crime (Taylor Swift featuring Haim, 2020)\n\nThis country-inflected murder mystery ballad opens with the Haim sisters' ominously repeating \"he did it,\" before Taylor spins the story of a woman whose husband kills her when she confronts him about his cheating; the narrator, her friend, then enacts her revenge. Make it into a mini-series!\n\nBad Blood (Taylor Swift featuring Kendrick Lamar, 2015)\n\nIt's hard to watch the video for this (featuring the entire cast of the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, plus Lena Dunham smoking a cigar) without triggering an unpleasant memory of summer '15, when hot takes about whether Taylor's \"squad\" (argh) was feminist or not were rife. Still, Kendrick Lamar's verses, and a few other judicious tweaks to the original album track, elevate this from a sing-sing taunt to an anthem.\n\nSafe & Sound (Taylor Swift featuring The Civil Wars, 2011)\n\nSafe & Sound, a collaboration with country duo The Civil Wars, plays over the closing credits of the first Hunger Games film, but listening back, its stripped-back, folky sound and haunting vocals wouldn't sound out of place on Folklore or Evermore.\n\nI Don't Wanna Live Forever (Zayn and Taylor Swift, 2016)\n\nThe real star of I Don't Wanna Live Forever, taken from the soundtrack for Fifty Shades Darker, is Zayn Malik's falsetto. Still, with production from Jack Antonoff, post-1989 Taylor's vocals meld surprisingly well into this dark R&B soundscape - though her lyric \"I've been looking sad in all the nicest places\" proves she's still the patron saint of sad girls.\n\nNothing New (Taylor Swift featuring Phoebe Bridgers, 2021)\n\nTaylor Swift and Phoebe Bridgers - it's a pairing that makes perfect sense. Nothing New, one of the 'vault' tracks from last year's re-record of Red, sees the pair in meditative mood, pondering the passage of time (\"how can a person know everything at 18 and nothing at 22?\").\n\nSoon You'll Get Better (Taylor Swift featuring The Chicks, 2019)\n\nThis one is all the more devastating if you've followed Taylor's from the start. In The Best Day, a track on her second album Fearless, teenage Taylor is \"laughing on the car ride home\" with her mum Andrea; in this collaboration with The Chicks, she is accompanying her to a doctor's appointment as part of Andrea's cancer treatment, \"just pretend[ing] it isn't real.\"\n\nFortnight (Taylor Swift featuring Post Malone, 2024)\n\nFortnight, from Swift's latest album, The Tortured Poet's Department, sees the singer team up with rapper and singer Post Malone. The lead single has been number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks, beating out the likes of Shaboozey, Sabrina Carpenter, and Hozier, (plus Swift herself, with I Can Do it With a Broken Heart and Down Bad in places 9 and 10, respectively).", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_Has_Changed", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everything Has Changed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile_(American_band)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exile (American band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Sheeran", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ed Sheeran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joker_and_the_Queen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Joker and the Queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bon_Iver", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bon Iver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ballad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colbie_Caillat", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colbie Caillat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haim_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haim (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Vernon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Vernon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic!_at_the_Disco", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Panic!

The new Swift has received upgrades both inside and outside, making it more premium and attractive than the outgoing model. Even though it gets many new features and a new engine, it does miss out on a couple of things which are available on the Swift which is sold in the UK. Let's take a look at that these features are:\n\nThe UK-spec Suzuki Swift gets ADAS Level 2 features like Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Departure Warning and Weaving Alert, Rear Cross Traffic Alert, Blind Spot Monitor, Enhanced Traffic Sign Recognition and an additional Driver Monitoring System. The new Swift sold in India misses out on this tech to keep costs in check.\n\nIn the UK, the Swift is offered with an optional all-wheel-drive variant. It comes handy in slippery road conditions. The Indian-spec model comes in a front-wheel drive option only. But fair enough, considering it doesn't snow in majority of the areas in India.\n\nThe UK-spec Swift comes equipped with heated seats, which is necessary in colder countries like the UK. In India, this feature has been axed, thanks to the hot climate in most parts of the country.\n\nThe newly launched India-spec Swift misses out on a 360-degree camera, which the UK model gets. Along with the 360-degree camera, it also misses out on front parking sensors. The Swift 2024 sold here only gets a reverse parking camera with rear sensors.\n\nThe Swift sold in the UK also gets a mild-hybrid system, which does not make its way to the Swift launched in India. Along with improving fuel economy, the mild-hybrid system also aids in torque assist. However, both the models produce the same power and torque figures, 82 PS and 112 Nm, respectively.\n\nThe 2024 Swift sold in India is available in 6 colour options. It misses out on black and yellow colour options which are available on the model in the UK.\n\nThe UK-spec model of the 2024 Maruti Swift features a CVT gearbox which can also be manually controlled with the help of paddle shifters. To keep costs under control, Maruti has offered the Indian model with a 5-speed AMT.\n\nThe UK-spec model of the Swift also gets a tyre pressure monitor, which isn't on offer here. This feature will let you know when there is a dip in tyre pressures or a puncture in any of the tyres.\n\nFor more details about the 2024 Maruti Suzuki Swift, head to our in-depth image gallery.

Sidoti's post was filled with anticipation for Swift's four consecutive shows at La D\u00e9fense Arena with the caption, \"The Eras Tour Europe starts tonight... Paris you're up first... who's coming?\" and the hashtags #TheErasTour and #4inarow.\n\nKelce's comment swiftly drew attention, receiving over 2000 likes and numerous replies in less than 30 minutes. The NFL star is no stranger to Swift's concerts, having attended her shows in Singapore, Sydney, Buenos Aires, and, naturally, Kansas City, where their romance began with Kelce's smooth attempt to gift the pop star a friendship bracelet with his phone number.\n\nFans were quick to leave comments noting how supportive Kelce is of his girlfriend. \"@killatrav supportive \ud83d\udc51,\" commented one user, while another chimed in saying, @killatrav heeeey \ud83d\udc4b\ud83d\udc4b\ud83d\udc4b thank you for making Taylor happy & treating her like she deserves to be treated, appreciate you \u2764\ufe0f.\" Other fans were wondering if Kelce himself would be there, leaving comments like, \"@killatrav I hope you're there \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc,\" and \"@killatrav hello be there or be square.\"\n\nDuring their consecutive career breaks, the pair has been seen frequently together, enjoying nights out and vacations with both each other and friends. Their most recent appearance was on April 27 at a charity event in Las Vegas to support Kelce's Chiefs teammate, Patrick Mahomes. At the Mahomies Foundation Golf Classic and Gala, Kelce and Swift, both 34, entered hand-in-hand, a moment captured in an Instagram video by Mahomes.\n\nKelce later took the stage, revealing that he and his \"significant other\" decided to donate four tickets to Swift's Eras Tour as an auction item. \"I think, um, I was just talking to my significant other,\" he announced. \"And, uh, we might have one other auction item that wasn't on the docket.

As of 2024, there are over 1.868 million apps available on the Apple App Store, representing a growth of 65161 applications compared to the previous year.\n\nThis article will examine two well-known programming languages, Objective C and Swift, and compare and contrast them, outlining the benefits and drawbacks of each. Are you curious to find out which language comes out on top?\n\nAs a first step in creating an iOS app, choosing the right programming language by an iOS app development company in USA is crucial. Objective-C and Swift are two choices for developing native iOS applications. Swift is different from Objective-C in what ways? How can you weigh each option's benefits and drawbacks to determine which is best suited to your project? Let's find out.\n\nThe Objective-C, a popular programming language, was developed by Stepstone in the 1980s. The object-oriented structure of Python enables programmers to handle complex structures and tasks. In tandem with this, Objective-C's syntax might be daunting to those new to the language.\n\nObjective-C, a slightly outdated programming language that is still relevant now, is compatible with both Swift and C. Despite the drawbacks, it still has a strong and experienced community of developers.\n\nManual memory management presents a major hurdle for Objective-C developers. It is vital for apps to operate well, and it can be annoying and a time waster too. Compared to Objective-C, Swift has this problem resolved by bringing memory management to a higher level.\n\nTogether with C and Smalltalk, Objective-C is a strangely bizarre language. In consequence, there are many redundant words and complex grammar. In contrast to Smalltalk-based object syntax, C syntax is used for non-object-oriented operations.\n\nDynamic typing and message passing is the reason why implementation and interface parts of a class in Objective-C are stored in separate files. While Objective-C is a very powerful language, its history has caused it to look ancient and outdated in contrast to Swift.\n\nChris Lattner, an employee of Apple, invented the new programming language Swift in 2010, and it was released to the public in 2014. It is a highly-developed version of Objective-C that aims to simplify programming and debugging processes.\n\nThe developers' rapid adoption of Swift can be partially attributed to the fact that it has modern features, a simplified syntax, and an automatic memory management. This dialect has become the de facto one for iOS development and has replaced Objective-C because of its power and efficiency.\n\nThe language is remarkable in developing applications for desktops, mobile phones, and servers. Perfect for code that is performance-sensitive, it has two advantages: quick bug detection and repair. You can use it on both Apple and Linux platforms. It is also quickly growing and shows great potential.\n\nThe modern syntax and enhanced safety features of Swift, like type inference, make it easier to develop iOS apps.Features like generics, options, type inference, and higher-order functions are common in today's programming languages.\n\n\"Significant improvements to the language and standard library, tweaks to the Swift compiler for a better developer experience, tweaks to tools in the Swift ecosystem, like SourceKit-LSP and the Swift Package Manager, plus refined Windows support,\" were the purported additions to Swift 5.7, which was released in September 2022.\n\nComparisons are often made between languages and technologies. Utilize this list and comparison to select the most appropriate technology for your project.\n\nThe main factor is the development environment. Factors like pricing, availability, and alternatives should be taken into account.\n\nFor developers who want to create Objective-C apps for iOS and OS X, Xcode is often considered a convenient integrated development environment (IDE). Xcode helps in the efficient running of the other environments like Visual Studio Code by Microsoft and AppCode by Apple.\n\nYou will be using Xcode, the iOS app development environment, which is integrated both Cocoa and especially Cocoa Touch. Moreover, Swift includes Cocoa Touch that gives an opportunity to develop apps for Apple TV and Apple Watch.\n\nHowever, other differences also take place in the development environment. Another option is Swift Playground. Swift offers you a playground environment which allows you to try out new functionalities without compiling the entire code, while you learn the language. You can quickly implement and run your solution idea in the Playgrounds by writing the code and seeing how it behaves.\n\nSwift offers access to advanced technical solutions and compatibility with the environment of Objective-C, which provides more opportunities.\n\nYou do not have to worry about the iOS because they are natively supported. Regardless, it is a fact. The two distinguishing factors are compatibility with iOS and having a simple interface.\n\nConsidering Objective-C's long history, your mobile app will effortlessly work with all the iOS versions. However, iOS 7 or above is required to operate Swift. This means you need to consider what kind of equipment your users have and clarify about whether users can limit access to iOS devices for models released after 2013.\n\nIn order to support the creation of user interfaces, Apple introduced SwiftUI. When iOS 13 (or later) comes out, you can use this Xcode UI tool to enhance your design. It frees developers of the need to create separate user interfaces for all Apple platforms.\n\nYou can also code your UI or edit the preview to do it. Changes are shown in a code and a preview side by side. It's a tie. Nevertheless, Swift's edge will continue to grow as time goes by.\n\nThe coding speed impacts the total cost of app development and the time-to-market. Although they are both included in iOS, Swift and Objective-C are not synonymous.\n\nCompared to other languages, Swift is definitely more modern. It is also easy to use because of its simplified syntax. It also suggests that it's easier to grasp.\n\nAn additional benefit of Swift is that it is said to have 30% fewer lines of code than Objective-C applications. The famously large code loss that Lyft experienced when migrating from Objective-C to Swift is much discussed. There are several advantages to reducing the amount of code, such as speeding up development, decreasing errors, and making testing easier and cheaper.\n\nSwift succeeds once again.\n\nWhen the technology used is of high quality and suitable for the task at hand, performance improves accordingly. Refactoring, maintenance, and the user experience (UX) get a whole lot easier as performance goes up.\n\nApple claims that Swift is faster than Objective-C. This is actually doable because Swift is a brand new language that was specifically made to be fast.\n\nDespite Objective-C's built-in garbage collector, well-written Swift code is far more efficient. Because of its easier syntax and compile-time type checking, Swift outperforms Objective-C in terms of performance. Swift improves memory management with the help of Automatic Reference Counting, or ARC. Additionally, dynamic libraries can be easily integrated with Swift, leading to even greater application efficiency.\n\nFollowing this, Swift outperforms Objective-C.\n\nWhile we finish up our detailed comparison of Swift and Objective-C, it's important to remember that there isn't going to be a simple right or wrong answer when it comes to developing iOS mobile applications.

Here we have a detailed image gallery of the all-new Maruti Suzuki Swift.\n\nExterior\n\nThe exterior design of the new Swift is an evolution from the previous generation. The front end has been heavily redesigned.\n\nThe hatchback comes with a redesigned front grille. There is no chrome on the front grille; it now gets a gloss black outline. The design is slightly different from the international version.\n\nThe headlamps on the new Swift are projector units. It also gets boomerang-shaped LED DRLs and fog lamps on the bumper.\n\nThe front look of the Swift is a bit polarizing, especially because of the new bonnet design. We feel that is something which will grow on the buyers or people who see the car over time.\n\nComing to the side profile, the new Swift's design looks similar to the older version.\n\nThe shoulder line wraps around the vehicle, giving it a distinct look from the previous version.\n\nThe alloy wheel design on the new Swift is different from the last version. It is a 15-inch dual-tone unit. The lower variants get 14-inch wheels.\n\nThe side profile of the hatchback also reveals the repositioned rear door handles. The door handles are placed on the door instead of the pillar like in the previous generation model.\n\nAt the rear, the Swift gets smoked clear lens LED tail lamps with LED lights in them. There is a high-mounted stop lamp, rear wiper, defogger, and washer. We also see rear parking cameras and sensors on the tailgate and bumper.\n\nThe rear of the Suzuki Swift does look a bit bulkier than before.\n\nInterior\n\nMoving in, we see a completely redesigned interior. The layered dashboard design is different from the previous generation.\n\nThe steering wheel is a flat-bottom unit which comes with buttons for cruise control and many other features.\n\nThe major attraction inside the cabin is the new 9-inch touchscreen infotainment system that supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The center console is facing the driver for easy usage.\n\nJust below that, we have AC vents, automatic climate control toggle switches, and a wireless phone charging pad.\n\nThe all-new Swift comes with fabric seats in black color which go well with the overall theme of the car.\n\nMaruti is offering the new Swift in 9 new color options including three dual-tone shades. They are - Metallic Sizzling Red, Prime Luster Blue, Prime Novel Orange, Metallic Magma Grey, Prime Splendid Silver, Pearl Arctic White, Sizzling Red with Midnight Black Roof (DT), Luster Blue with Midnight Black Roof, and Pearl Arctic white with Midnight Black roof.\n\nLuster Blue and Novel Orange are new shades with the new Swift.\n\nMaruti is now offering 6 airbags as standard with the new Swift.\n\nEngine\n\nMaruti Suzuki Swift is powered by a brand new 1.2-liter, 3-cylinder, naturally aspirated petrol engine.\n\nThis engine generates 82 Bhp and 112 Nm of peak torque.\n\nThis engine is available with a 5-speed manual and 5-speed AMT gearbox option.\n\nThe manual version has a claimed economy of 24.80 kmpl while the AMT version returns 25.75 kmpl.", "source": {"uri": "cartoq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CarToq - India\u2019s #1 auto content site"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ajeesh_kuttan@cartoq.com", "name": "Ajeesh Kuttan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki_Swift", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suzuki Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatchback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hatchback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grille_(car)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grille (car)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumper_(car)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bumper (car)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outline (list)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_lighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive lighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maruti_Suzuki", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maruti Suzuki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_plating", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chrome plating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hood_(car)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hood (car)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy_wheel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alloy wheel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytime_running_lamp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daytime running lamp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windscreen_wiper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Windscreen wiper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washing_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washing machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sensor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_manual_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automated manual transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heating,_ventilation,_and_air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(car)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trunk (car)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_console_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Center console (automobile)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping", "label": "dmoz/Shopping", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Electrical", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Electrical", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Engineering", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Interior_Design", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Interior Design", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 52}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.cartoq.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-maruti-swift-launched-photo-gallery-fb.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546454", "eventUri": "eng-9546454", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 93, "relevance": 1}

It was traditionally the sixth song on the setlist on previous legs.\n\nThen Swift pulled another surprise - moving the sequence concentrating on her Red album to an earlier part of the show.\n\nDuring those songs, the star wore a t-shirt emblazoned with the statement: \"This is not Taylor's version\" - a reference to the ongoing campaign to re-record her first six albums.\n\nSwift performed the Tortured Poets Department material in a billowing cream ball gown, while the on-stage visuals adopted new a black-and-white theme.\n\nFor the downbeat ballad Down Bad, she appeared in the tractor beam of a UFO - a reference to the song's opening lyric: \"Did you really beam me up / In a cloud of sparkling dust / Just to do experiments on?\"\n\nThe new music largely deals with the breakdown of two relationships - with British actor Joe Alwyn and The 1975's lead singer, Matty Healy.\n\nOn stage, Swift jokingly described this portion of the show as \"female rage, the musical\".\n\nThe final portion of the show - concentrating on the diaphanous pop of 2022's Midnights album - was unchanged, with Swift ending on the hit single Karma.\n\nThe pop superstar's tour has become a cultural phenomenon, on a scale not seen since Madonna and Michael Jackson's concerts in the 1980s.\n\nShe is playing 152 stadium dates, with dates booked until December 2024.\n\nWhen she wraps up, ticket sales are projected to reach $1.4 billion (\u00a31.1 billion) - making it the most profitable tour of all time, surpassing the $939 million (\u00a3750 million) Elton John made on his multiyear farewell tour.\n\nThe tour comes to the UK on 7 June, with dates in Edinburgh, Liverpool, Cardiff and London.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

In Paris on Thursday night she put it more succinctly: \"Female rage, the musical.\"\n\nThe Eras Tour has travelled across the Americas, Asia and Australia. Following concerts in 12 European countries - including Spain, Germany, Ireland and Portugal - it will return for a final run in the US and Canada. Swift's UK concerts begin on 7 June at Edinburgh's Murrayfield Stadium, before moving to Liverpool, Cardiff and London's Wembley Stadium.\n\nIn the first of her European dates, at La D\u00e9fense arena in Paris, Swift added seven songs from her new 31-track album, including the single Fortnight and I Can Do It With A Broken Heart, which charts the difficulties she experienced touring after a relationship breakdown: \"All the pieces of me shatter\u0435d as the crowd was chanting, 'more'... I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art.\"\n\nThe order of the other Eras featured in her tour also underwent a shakeup, with Red moving up the schedule and the twin 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore combined. Some fan favourite songs such as Tolerate It and Long Live seem to have been dropped from the show.\n\nTTPD has cemented Swift as the biggest pop star this century by many metrics. The album has dominated streaming services globally and tracks from it occupied all top 14 spots on the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in the week of release, breaking the record she set with her previous album, Midnights.\n\nSwift's The Eras Tour, which began in March 2023 and will continue until December this year, is the highest grossing of all time, and the first concert tour to hit $1bn according to live music industry analysts at Pollstar, who predict that Swift could bring in $2bn over the span of the tour.\n\nThe Guardian's Adrian Horton gave a five star review to the opening concert in Glendale, Arizona in March 2023, calling it \"an indisputably epic start\". Another five-star review followed for her Australian tour opener, with Giselle Au-Nhien Nguyen describing it as \"an eye-popping spectacle and completely engrossing\".\n\nAs the tour arrives in Europe, several European cities have already seen a mark up in hotel prices, with some hotels selling out of accommodation months in advance.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news",

There was a particularly furious rendition of Who's Afraid of Little Old Me? and an elaborate I Can Do It With A Broken Heart with a golden-era Hollywood dance routine.\n\n\"You were the first crowd to see songs from The Tortured Poets Department,\" she said before adding: \"Or, as I like to call it, 'Female Rage: the Musical'\".\n\nHowever, adding new songs to the setlist meant some tracks had to be dropped from the 3-hour show.

See the new setlist.", "body": "When Taylor Swift embarked on the Eras Tour in 2023, she started with a setlist of 44 songs spanning 10 albums that had some small tweaks before filming and releasing her tour movie with 45 songs.\n\nBut after a two-month break and a new album drop, fans were expecting big changes for the first concert in Paris on Thursday.\n\nAside from Swift wearing a new outfit to kick off the concert, everything at first appeared to be business as usual.\n\nAfter she finished skipped \"The Archer,\" the sixth song in the previous set list, fans immediately noticed, wondering what if the change was to make room for a new era.\n\nSwift released a new album, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" on April 19, and fans speculated that the singer would add it as a new era on the tour. She had posted a YouTube Short showing her practicing choreography that was not in the set prior to the two-month break after the Singapore stop.\n\nBut skipping her song from the \"Lover\" album was just the beginning of several changes that may be seen when Swift comes to New Orleans in October.\n\nChanges to Eras Tour concert in Paris\n\nThe international popstar started her concert in the usual manner with \"Lover\" songs then \"Fearless.\" She rearranged the set list, placing her \"Red\" album's song right afterward, instead of transitioning to \"Evermore\" as she had in the past.\n\nAfter finishing her 10-minute version of \"All To Well,\" Swift disappeared and new graphics danced across the backdrop, and in came dancers wearing purple dancing to a soft track singing, \"Please, don't be in love with someone else. Please, don't have somebody waiting on you,\" before performing the single off \"Speak Now.\"\n\nIn the week leading up to the Paris show, social media rumors that her koi fish guitar used on the tour was returned to the Country Music Hall of Fame Museum. That makes sense because the song \"Long Live,\" which she sung while playing the famous blue guitar, was cut in Paris.\n\nAfter the singer's \"Reputation\" era ended, a snake slithered across the display through a forest scene and then dissipated into firefly-like sparkles covering the stage as the concert transitioned to the Folklore era.\n\nAfter April 2023, Swift started her \"Folklore\" section of the concert with \"The 1,\" \"Betty\" and \"The Last Great American Dynasty,\" but this time she started with \"Cardigan\" while she was on top of her \"folklore house\" before singing \"Betty.\"\n\nSwift then announced the sister albums, \"Folklore\" and \"Evermore,\" have now been combined into one segment as she started playing \"Champagne Problems\" on the piano.\n\nThe singer finished that segment with \"Willow\" before the mountains behind her disappeared into the cityscape that her \"1989\" portion of the set is known for.\n\nTortured Poets Department songs in Paris\n\nAfter finishing \"Bad Blood,\" the arena went dark and papers started to float on the screen in black and white as members of the audience started screaming for \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" which Swift later jokingly called \"female rage: the musical.\"\n\nAs the screen started to show an empty street, Swift rose at the front of the stage with a white dress akin to one she wore at the 2024 Grammy Awards, where she announced the release of the album.\n\nShe started with \"But Daddy I Love Him,\" then did a brief portion of \"So Highschool\" before doing a moving performance of \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me\" with a platform that had the singer floating around the stage.\n\nTo continue \"The Tortured Poets Department\" section, Swift performed \"Down Bad\" and then transitioned to her first single, \"Fortnight,\" as dancers pushed onto the stage a platform with two chairs and a typewriter.\n\nWhen Swift got to the bridge of \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived,\" a group of people playing snare drums marched behind her before falling to the ground with Swift to end the song.\n\nPicking Swift off the floor, she and two dancers put on a short vintage Hollywood-style play to revive the singer before she started to perform \"I Can Do it With a Broken Heart,\" complete with 1950s-style feather fans and costumes. Then the curtain closed on \"The Tortured Poets Department\" before the acoustic set.\n\nSwift finished the concert with the \"Midnights\" album set with no changes.\n\nThe setlist for Paris night one\"Miss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince\"\"Cruel Summer\"\"The Man\"\"You Need to Calm Down\"\"Lover\"\"Fearless\"\"You Belong With Me\"\"Love Story\"\"22\"\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\"\"I Knew You Were Trouble\"\"All To Well\" (10-minute version)\"Enchanted\"\"...

However, besides new songs, Swift debuted brand-new outfits for almost all her eras (of course, except Reputation, which never got a bodysuit change).\n\nSwift's record-breaking tour started in the U.S. in March 2023, and she played 83 shows across 30 cities in South America, Asia, and Australia. As she embarked on the European leg, Swift pulled all the stops and wowed the fans with dazzling outfits in Paris after a two-month break.\n\nThe Eras Tour started with the Lover era, where Swift debuted a new dazzling bodysuit. This time, she flaunted her figure in an orange outfit with pink jewels and matching Christian Louboutin custom boots. Her previous bodysuits were custom Atelier Versace, which might be the case here, too.\n\nStill in the Lover era, Swift put on a matching blazer as she performed \"The Man.\" She didn't keep it on much, though, although it looked fire.\n\nGoing into Fearless, Swift changed outfits again. Wishing she could dance with the audience in a storm in her best dress, the Grammy-winning singer debuted a black and silver fringe dress with black boots.\n\nInstead of following the old setlist and order of the eras, Swift switched to Red right after Fearless. She debuted a brand-new T-shirt that read \"This IS NOT Taylor's Version.\" The message referenced Swift re-recording her old albums so she could own the masters of the songs she's written on her first six albums. The albums she re-records add Taylor's Version next to the original name. The outfit she wears on the show recreates her \"22\" music video, and she keeps the T-shirt while performing the song.\n\nAlthough the Red era wasn't filled with surprises when it came to its setlist, the outfits were new. She debuted a new bodysuit when performing \"We Are Never Getting Back Together\" and \"I Knew You Were Trouble.\" The new romper, which is from Ashish, is slightly darker than the other versions and has different, smaller straps.\n\nWhen it comes to switching outfits for the Reputation era, Swift clearly isn't \"Ready for It.\" The singer-songwriter has been wearing the Roberto Cavalli catsuit since the beginning of the Eras Tour. It's currently the only era that hasn't featured an outfit change since the beginning. This proves she really is a mastermind.\n\nSwift combined the Folklore and Evermore eras into one, bringing the sister albums together as God intended. For it, she debuted a brand-new yellow dress with cape-like sleeves, perfect for performing \"August\" and \"Willow.\"\n\nHere we are folks -- the attraction of the evening. Although the Eras Tour's new outfits were exciting, everyone wanted to see if she added The Tortured Poets Department to the setlist. She did, and with it came some awesome outfits.\n\nWearing all white for most of the set, Swift donned a dress similar to a wedding gown, with her \"Fortnight\" lyrics, \"I love you, it's ruining my life,\" covering the lower part of the dress. She later added a white general's coat on top. Before ending the era, she changed once more, debuting a glittered black top and shorts with a gold coat.\n\nA special mention goes to her 1989 outfit, which was the first time she wore a multi-colored top and skirt for the era. She also had boots of different colors.\n\nTaking a little over three hours, Swift changes over ten outfits during the show. Her changing the bodysuits every concert led to fans creating \"Swiftball,\" where fans fill out a form guessing what she might wear. Given that her new leg comes with a plethora of new options, it will be very difficult, if not impossible, for Swifties to guess what she'll wear from now on.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "monica_coman@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Monica Coman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodysuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bodysuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation_Stadium_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reputation Stadium Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fearless_(Taylor_Swift_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fearless (Taylor Swift song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Are_Never_Ever_Getting_Back_Together", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Knew_You_Were_Trouble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "I Knew You Were Trouble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blazer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Louboutin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian Louboutin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versace", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Versace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Willow (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evermore_(Taylor_Swift_album)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evermore (Taylor Swift album)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore_(Taylor_Swift_album)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Folklore (Taylor Swift album)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America_certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recording Industry Association of America certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Cavalli", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roberto Cavalli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_dress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wedding dress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Short film"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/taylor-swift-eras-tour-france.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546454", "eventUri": "eng-9546454", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 452993440, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 114, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 114}}}

The pop megastar debuted several tracks from her new album, The Tortured Poets Department, during night one of a four-show stand at the Paris La D\u00e9fense Arena in Nanterre, France near Paris.\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department, surprise released on April 19, segment came sandwiched between the 1989 section and the acoustic \"Surprise Songs\" section, the later including a fitting rendition of \"Paris.\"\n\nTaylor kicked off the TTPD premieres with the album's sixth track, \"But Daddy I Love Him.\" Swift then offered first time plays of \"So High School,\" \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?,\" \"Down Bad\" \"Fortnight\" and \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived.\"\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department segment came to a close with \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart\" followed by the aforementioned \"Paris.\" Taylor then took to the piano for one last TTPD debut, \"Loml.\" All told, Swift delivered eight of the album's 16 tracks.

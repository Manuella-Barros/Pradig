Frankly, it's tough to pick a definite list of the best Friends episodes, because everyone will have a different ranking, and they'd all be right. And yet, here we are, reminiscing about the best of the best, and ruminating over which episodes had the most entertaining storyline, banter, and character development for our favorite six Manhattanites Chandler (Matthew Perry), Joey (Matt LeBlanc), Monica (Courteney Cox), Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow), Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), Ross (David Schwimmer).\n\nIf you're a superfan, you might revisit old episodes for the Easter eggs and the real-life context that drove the show. (In the 2021 Max reunion special, for example, Aniston and Schwimmer admitted they had feelings for each other and threw that mutual love into their characters.) You may also view the show now as a loving memorial to the incredible talent of the late Perry. But if you don't know it quite well, or are looking for a stand-out episode to throw on, below you can find a list of which Friends episodes are most worth your time.\n\nThe first words of the entire show are, \"There's nothing to tell!\" Even though it was the pilot, it's still a fantastic episode, where we immediately see the chemistry between the characters, particularly the spark between Ross and Rachel.\n\nThe core cast later said that, looking back, they really knew they were making something special when they filmed this episode. It's a crossover with other shows at the time, including Seinfeld and Mad About You, that all aired the same night in a huge monolithic event.\n\nThis one features a delightful cameo from Steve Zahn, and top-notch chemistry between him and Kudrow. The opening is also funny -- with Rachel trapping a pigeon in a pot and then letting it go in surprise when she finds out Phoebe is married. Also, this is where the long-running \"third nipple\" bit first comes into play.\n\nThis one features an iconic scene between Ross and Rachel, where she jumps on his back as he's listening to the message she left him while drunk on a blind date and admitting her feelings for him. (What a mouthful, but also a great physical comedy.) That kiss follows the dramatic confrontation, and although it's technically not their first on-screen kiss (the first being from a dream sequence), it's one of the series' most swoon-worthy moments.\n\nThere are many references and details in the titular old, home video at the center of this episode, from Ross' hair to the '80s fashion. (There are also some very dated, problematic jokes, like Monica's fat suit.) Ultimately, it's an important Ross-Rachel episode -- in which Phoebe proclaims, \"She's your lobster!\" and they share a great kiss.\n\nThe brilliance of this episode is that it's shot entirely in Monica and Rachel's apartment, and pretty accurate to the timing of the episode -- they basically have 30 minutes to get ready -- so the episode plays out pretty real to time. And then, obviously, there's Joey wearing all of Chandler's clothes.\n\nThis one features some classic scenes, including the part where the girls try to beat the boys in football using unconventional tactics (including Phoebe's attempt to distract Chandler by flashing him). That, plus the fun detail of the Gellar Cup (a troll doll on a 2x4), makes this a hidden gem of detail.\n\nFriends has a handful of great celebrity cameos, and \"The One with the Ultimate Fighting Champion\" is peak Jon Favreau. Not to mention, this also features a very short but very funny appearance by legends Billy Crystal and the late Robin Williams.\n\nThe combo of Monica, Joey, and Chandler is underrated -- they have amazing banter. Plus, this one has a funny and foretelling scene between Monica and Chandler where she says, \"I love you -- but you will always be the guy who peed on me,\" as a reason not to date him.\n\nFriends was particularly good at their holiday content, and this classic Thanksgiving episode was no exception. At its core, this seasonal installment is all about reaffirming to men everywhere that they can have besties and it's okay to show feelings.\n\nThis one includes the now-classic competition between Rachel, Monica, Joey, and Chandler, emceed by Ross, where they bet Rachel and Monica's apartment to the winner. Spoiler alert: The girls lose, and Monica (borrowing a line from Ross) screams, \"NOOOOOO!\" in hilarious fashion.\n\nFriends relied on its twist endings and cliffhangers to keep its audience guessing what would happen next. The two-part season 4 finale was probably the best example of the form, with the introduction of Monica and Chandler's relationship and Ross' gasp-inducing slip-up at the altar, \"I, Ross, take thee Rachel.\"\n\nSeason 5 of Friends deals with the fallout of all the bombshells from Ross and Emily's wedding. It's not just a major step forward for the show, but it ultimately sets up many of the storylines that last through the rest of the series in the best, most awkward-funny way.\n\nMany superfans cite this as their all-time favorite episode, in part because it features a hilarious -- and very long -- bit of physical comedy, thanks to Ross' leather pants. And Rachel and Joey discussing Monica's and Chandler's secret relationship? Chef's kiss.\n\nOne memorable line says it all: \"They don't know that we know that they know!\" This domino effect of discovery, combined with the pure chaos that the show was so good at, makes this one a narrative pretzel in the best possible way.\n\nAlso known as the \"PIVOT!\" episode (another highly meme-able moment that the show originated), this one also features Phoebe's highly questionable decision to find a cop's badge and use it wildly before being caught by the handsome cop it belongs to.\n\nIf you've forgotten, this is where we learn that Phoebe runs like she's being chased: \"a cross between Kermit the Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man,\" as Rachel puts it. It's a fan-favorite among Phoebe devotees.\n\nEven if you don't know Friends well, you probably know this highly meme-ed dance routine with Ross and Monica. Even as adults, their sibling rivalry comes into play throughout the series, so it's a joy to see them tag-team on this New Year's Eve episode as they try to fulfill their dream of being featured on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve.\n\nHi, Reese Witherspoon! This one's still very culturally relevant, as Jennifer Aniston and Witherspoon have remained friends and even worked together again on The Morning Show. At the end of the episode, when the two sisters say goodbye to each other -- \"BYE BYEEEE!\" -- it became a prototypical version of, \"I'm saying goodbye, but clearly dissing you.\"\n\nThis one features a rare but satisfying interplay between Ross and Joey. And while the bloopers that accompany each season are always funny (and sometimes the best part of the show), the bloopers from the nap scene are extra special. They're arguably funnier than the scene itself.\n\nThe episode is structured brilliantly, with flashbacks to how the six friends handled the milestone of turning 30. Monica's is probably the best; Courteney Cox playing the character as very drunk is incredible to watch. There's also fun foreshadowing here!\n\nFriends prided itself on its season mysteries and how the gang finds out about them. This one, where Monica, Phoebe, Joey, and the audience discover that Ross is the father of Rachel's baby, is a well-paced and acted conundrum.\n\nIf you're looking for a classic episode with the entire ensemble interacting with one another, this is it. Specifically, they each give an incredible look when it's revealed that Rachel came on to Ross the night they conceived their child together.\n\nThe Halloween episodes are always a joy, in part because of the costume each character wears. In this one, Chandler dresses like a legendary pink bunny and Ross is SPUDnik (a cross between a potato and the Russian satellite), which Joey immediately confuses as \"doodie.\"\n\nTechnically, this storyline where Rachel gives birth isn't contained to the season 8 finale, but it's pretty special how it all plays out. This two-parter eventually leads to the season 9 opener, \"The One Where No One Proposes,\" during which Rachel says yes when she thinks someone proposed to her. It's another great cliffhanger payoff.\n\n\"Chandler watches shark porn!\" If you know, you know -- and if you don't, it's all the more reason to tune into this season 9 stand-out. The drama unfolds when Chandler changes the channel to a nature show about sharks to cover up what he's really watching, leading to some pretty epic confusion.\n\nMatt LeBlanc and Lisa Kudrow always had fantastic chemistry, like their characters were competing to be the most spacey, but this episode is peak Joey-Phoebe. It's a testament to how much the two actors love each other IRL. Plus, Phoebe hilariously yells about a sock.\n\nIf you believe in the rumors, the storyline in this episode was supposed to include Chandler cheating on Monica, but Matthew Perry didn't want that to be a part of their love story. It also features a hilarious cameo from Selma Blair, and ultimately ends up being a cute flashback episode to some of Monica and Chandler's best moments.\n\nIf you've ever used the iconic Friends meme featuring Ross squeaking out an, \"I'm fine!\" when he is very clearly not -- then you've captured the essence of this episode. That's one of the ways this storyline will live in perpetuity, thanks to the brilliance of David Schwimmer's cringe comedy here.\n\nSecond only to the \"Ross wears squeaky leather pants\" bit, this is probably one of David Schwimmer's very best episodes. It also features a cameo from Jennifer Coolidge that made the actors laugh so hard they struggled to get a take where all of them are straight-faced.\n\nA young Paul Rudd joining the cast was an inspired choice by the showrunners. Mike and Phoebe's snowy outdoor wedding, plus their vows, and all of the antics throughout the episode are so wonderfully Phoebe and the perfect happy ending for the character.\n\nThe last word of the show is \"Where?\" spoken by the beloved Perry. For superfans, the two-part finale is tough to watch because of how much real love and sadness is reflected in the characters and actors. The classic Ross and Rachel scene where she gets off the plane even had to be filmed in secret so it wasn't spoiled before it aired. No one had dry eyes that day. As for the final shot with a wraparound view of Monica and Rachel's empty apartment, landing on the door, it's a perfect way to close out the sitcom.", "source": {"uri": "marieclaire.com", "dataType":

Set in New York City, the series follows friends, Ross (David Schwimmer), Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), Monica (Courteney Cox), Chandler (Matthew Perry), Joey (Matt LeBlanc), and Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow), as they try to navigate their way in the world and adapt to the major life events that most people experience at some point in their lives.\n\nFrom break-ups to landing dream jobs, each friend goes through an array of ups and downs, but no matter what the situation may be, they're always there to pick each other up as well as celebrate their personal victories. Even though the show is essentially a comedy, it still has some memorable sad moments, such as Monica and Richard breaking up and Joey moving into his own place. Out of all the unforgettable tear-filled moments in the show, these are the saddest Friends episodes.\n\nFriends TV-14RomanceSitcom\n\nRelease Date September 22, 1994 Cast Jennifer Aniston , Courteney Cox , Lisa Kudrow , Matt LeBlanc , Matthew Perry , David Schwimmer Seasons 10 10 \"The One With the Boob Job\" Season 9, Episode 16\n\nAs Mike (Paul Rudd) and Phoebe's relationship continues to progress, Phoebe takes a big step and asks Mike to move in with her, which he happily agrees to. While they start the moving process and prepare for the next chapter, the discussion of marriage and their future comes up and reveals that the couple is not exactly on the same page. When Mike tells Phoebe he never wants to get married again, Phoebe can't deny she doesn't dream of tying the knot and the two decide to break up.\n\nIn season 9, episode sixteen, \"The One With the Boob Job,\" fans are thrilled when Mike and Phoebe decide to move in together, as they were considered to be one of the best couples in the series. Even though both of them come from completely different worlds, they just seem to fit so well together, so it's understandable how heartbroken fans were when they made the difficult decision to end their relationship. Considering how far their relationship had come, and being so close to making that next major milestone, all to be shattered in the blink of an eye makes this one of the saddest Friends episodes.\n\n9 \"The One with the Fake Monica\" Season 1, Episode 21\n\nWhen Ross' pet monkey, Marcel, begins to exhibit unruly behavior, Ross learns that the best thing for Marcel is to find him a home in a zoo where he can be with other monkeys. As Ross submits applications to several zoos (almost like Marcel is applying for college), he finally receives a letter from the San Diego Zoo, which is willing to take Marcel. While it's the best scenario for Marcel, that doesn't mean it isn't difficult for Ross to say goodbye to his friend.\n\nThe departure of Marcel in season 1, episode twenty-one, \"The One with the Fake Monica,\" is one of the saddest episodes in Friends, as Ross continues to struggle with his divorce from Susan and being a part-time dad to his newborn son. Even though Marcel had his moments of being a pain in the butt, he did bring some sense of happiness to Ross, so as he and the others say goodbye to Marcel at the airport, it's hard not to feel the tears welling up. Even though Marcel wouldn't have made a great pet long-term and this was for his benefit, it's still a downer to see Ross in such a sad state, which is why this is one of the saddest episodes in the series.\n\n8 \"The One With the Monkey\" Season 1, Episode 10\n\nWhile Phoebe is performing at Central Perk, she abruptly chastises two men who are whispering during her performance, demanding to know what is so important that they can't wait until after to talk. To Phoebe's surprise, one of them, David (Hank Azaria) explains how he was telling his friend, Max, how beautiful Phoebe was, resulting in Phoebe cutting her performance short. As David and Phoebe are caught up in a whirlwind romance, their bliss is destroyed when David and Max receive a grant to conduct research in Minsk, Russia.\n\nPhoebe has always been the kind of person who deserves the best, so when she meets David in season 1, episode ten, \"The One With the Monkey,\" audiences think she's finally found someone but quickly dash their hopes by sending the poor guy off to Russia. Even though David initially decides not to go, Phoebe, being the gem that she is, knows she can't be the reason why David stays and eventually convinces him to go. As soon as Phoebe finds her match, the universe unfairly steps in, but despite the devastating choice, it reveals how selfless and considerate Phoebe truly is and puts her at the center of one of the series' saddest episodes.\n\n7 \"The One With the Invitation\" Season 4, Episode 21\n\nAs Ross and Emily (Helen Baxendale) plan their upcoming wedding, Ross is unsure if he should invite Rachel considering their romantic history but he eventually decides to send her an invitation. When Rachel receives the invite, she too becomes conflicted about the whole event and struggles to decide if she should RSVP or not. Through a series of flashbacks of their relationship, Rachel finally makes the decision not to go.\n\nThe terrible timing of Ross and Rachel is a constant theme throughout the series, but when Ross is about to get married, it puts things in a different light, presenting the question: is this the end of them? In season 4, episode twenty-one, \"The One With the Invitation,\" audiences look back on their relationship, which only solidifies how the two essentially belong together. Even though Rachel doesn't realize she's still in love with Ross, fans can tell this just by her choosing not to attend the wedding, which cements this episode as one the saddest Friends episodes.\n\n6 \"The One Where Heckles Dies\" Season 2, Episode 3\n\nWhen Rachel and Monica's downstairs neighbor, Mr. Heckles (Larry Hankin) unexpectedly dies, they're surprised to learn that he left everything to them in his will. As the friends go through all of the man's belongings and random trinkets, Chandler realizes he and Heckles have way too many things in common, causing him to panic and believe that he will end up just like their former neighbor.\n\nSeason 2, episode 3, \"The One Where Heckles Dies,\" isn't short of comedic moments but as Chandler discovers more about Heckles, the more audiences know more about him and how sad of an existence he truly lived. When he was younger, it seems as though Heckles had everything going for him but somewhere along the line, things went south for the guy, which is incredibly sad for anyone to experience. It's one thing to die alone, but to die feeling as though you missed out on life is a tragedy in itself. Between Chandler's dramatics and giving Heckles a bit of an insightful (but depressing) backstory, this episode ranks as one of the saddest episodes in the show.\n\n5 \"The One With Barry and Mindy's Wedding\" Season 2, Episode 24\n\nWhen Monica decides to ask Richard (Tom Selleck) about their potential future together, she's thrilled when he reveals that he imagines them married but her happiness quickly disappears when she learns that he doesn't want to have any more kids. Initially, Monica tries to convince him and herself that she doesn't need to have children and could be happy without them, but as she continues to think about it, she admits that she can't imagine her life without becoming a mom, resulting in the two deciding to part ways.\n\nEvery fan was rooting for Monica and Richard and in season 2, episode 24, \"The One With Barry and Mindy's Wedding,\" it's safe to say that everyone was as devastated as they were about their breakup. Despite their large age gap, Monica and Richard went together like two peas in a pod and were essentially relationship goals. While it's understandable why they ended their relationship, it's still sad to see a promising couple like Monica and Richard end their relationship, especially at a happy occasion like a wedding (even if it is Barry and Mindy's), which is why it's one of the saddest Friends episodes.\n\n4 \"The One With the Fertility Test\" Season 6, Episode 21\n\nFor about a year, Monica and Chandler have been struggling to get pregnant and, after trying every possible suggestion and method, they make the difficult decision to see a doctor who can hopefully shed some light on any issues. Unfortunately, the test results reveal that the problem lies in both Monica and Chandler, at no fault of their own, revealing they most likely will never be able to naturally conceive children of their own.\n\nIt's no secret that Monica has dreamed about becoming a mom and raising children of her own and in season 9, episode twenty-one, \"The One With the Fertility Test,\" it seems as though that might never happen to her and Chandler. While the news is not what either of them expected, it becomes the first major test in their marriage and brings them even closer together. Even though there are other options for them to still have kids, the reality of the situation and Monica's disappointment about never being able to physically carry a baby is a heartbreaking blow, ranking this episode as one of the show's all-time saddest.\n\n3 \"The One Where Joey Moves Out\" Season 2, Episode 16\n\nWhen Joey and Chandler disagree about their individual living behavior (like Joey licking a spoon and putting it back in the drawer), both of them begin to wonder if their living arrangement is still working. After they attend a party at one of Joey's friend's apartments, Joey starts to think that he's too old to still have a roommate and makes the surprising decision to find a place of his own.\n\nJoey and Chandler are a vital duo in the series with their comedic banter and antics, which are the highlight of many episodes. When Joey makes the decision to find his own apartment in season 2, episode sixteen, \"The One Where Joey Moves Out,\" it leaves an emptiness in the hearts of fans, completely changing the dynamic of the best friends. After arguing over Joey's choice, Chandler eventually accepts it and genuinely wants the best for his friend, but when Joey comes back in to give Chandler a final hug, it cements the episode as one of the saddest moments in the entire show.\n\n2 \"The One With the Morning After\" Season 3, Episode 16\n\nAfter Rachel and Ross decide to take a break from their relationship, Ross wakes up the next day and is shocked to see that he's in bed with another woman. When Rachel calls him and the two decide to get back together, Ross goes to extreme lengths to make sure Rachel doesn't find out about the previous night, but despite his best efforts, word eventually gets back to Rachel, who is utterly crushed.\n\nWhether they were or weren't on an actual break, season 3, episode 16, \"The One With the Morning After,\" is one of the most upsetting episodes that, unfortunately, doesn't have a happy ending. Witnessing Rachel and Ross hash out the incident toes the line of comedic relief, but at the peak of their argument, they both begin to break down in tears. It's hard not to feel bad for both of them in some sense, but at the end of the day, there is nothing more heartbreaking than when two people who are still madly in love with each other end their relationship because the trust has been broken. Even though Rachel and Ross end up together in the end, the episode is still without a doubt one of the saddest and hardest episodes to watch.\n\n1 \"The Last One\" Season 10, Episode 17 & 18\n\nIn the best episode of Friends' final season, \"The Last One,\" each of the friends embarks on a new adventure in a new place, such as Chandler and Monica becoming parents of not one, but TWO babies and Ross and Rachel FINALLY getting back together. While it's an absolute joy to see all of them move into the next chapter in their lives together and apart, it's still sad to watch them move on to bigger and better things in the empty place they used to call home.\n\nEven though the two-part finale brilliantly wraps the show up in a neat, satisfying bow, watching everyone leave the apartment for the last time feels as though audiences are saying goodbye to six friends they have come to know and love. The finale isn't exactly sad, but it is bittersweet as the show has captured the hearts of millions of fans around the world, but like every good thing in life, it eventually has to come to an end. Despite the ending being an inevitable moment for the show, the finale definitely ranks as the saddest (but hopeful) Friends episode of all time.\n\nWatch on Max\n\nKEEP READING: The 12 Funniest

He was found submerged and unresponsive in a hot tub at his Los Angeles home. A number of prescriptions were found in his system including ketamine, which was ruled as the cause of his death.\n\nThe \"Friends\" cast came together to mourn Perry after his tragic passing.\n\nOn the 20-year anniversary of the sitcom's end, creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane did an interview on Today where they revealed that some parts of the script for the finale leaked before the episode aired.\n\n\"Oh my god, we tried so hard to keep it a secret,\" Kauffman said. \"We were desperate to keep it a secret and it got out. And it was an inside job.\"\n\nHere are more fun facts about the \"Friends\" series finale that even super fans of the show might not know about.\n\nIn his 2022 memoir, \"Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing,\" Perry revealed that he asked Kauffman to give him the final line of the series.\n\n\"No one else will care about this except me,\" the actor wrote in his book, published one year before his death.\n\nPerry's wish was granted, as the Season 10 finale ended with Chandler and Monica saying goodbye to their empty apartment alongside Rachel, Phoebe, Joey and Ross.\n\nRachel suggests they all go grab a final cup of coffee before Chandler and Monica leave New York City and go to live in the suburbs with their children.\n\n\"Sure,\" Chandler responds. \"Where?\" As dedicated viewers know, the group would always meet up at their local Central Perk coffee place.\n\nFilming the final episode of \"Friends\" was extremely emotional for the six main stars.\n\n\"I don't think we've ever taken more time in hair and makeup in between scenes,\" Aniston said during an interview with Oprah Winfrey. \"Also, that fact that we kept crying all our makeup off, over and over again.\"\n\nSchwimmer revealed that he kept his composure until the cast did their pre-show ritual huddle.\n\n\"I started to lose it. That was the moment I was dreading,\" he said.\n\nThe \"Friends\" producers invited people outside the main cast to witness the taping of the final episode.\n\nHank Azaria and Maggie Wheeler, who played Phoebe's ex, David, and Chandler's ex, Janice, respectively, were both there. So was David Arquette, who was married to Cox at the time.\n\nWheeler told People that \"the energy\" on set during the final episode \"was just incredible.\"\n\nBrad Pitt, who made a guest appearance during Season 8 while he was still married to Aniston, did not attend the final taping because he didn't want to be spoiled by the show's ending.\n\n\"He [Brad] said, 'Don't tell me anything!' \" Crane said in an interview.\n\nThe cast's family and friends were also on set for the finale.\n\nThe cast and crew of \"Friends\" threw three big parties to celebrate the show's end.\n\nAniston and Pitt hosted a dinner party at their home on January 19, 2004, three days after the first part of the finale finished production.\n\nThe night before filming officially wrapped on January 22, the cast and the crew got together at Sole in West Hollywood.\n\nThe third and final party took place on January 24, the day after production on the series concluded, at the Park Plaza Hotel in NYC. The Rembrandts performed the show's theme song, \"I'll Be There For You,\" at the celebration.\n\n52.5 million viewers tuned in live to watch \"The Last One\" on May 6, 2004. The episode was the most watched entertainment telecast in six years, as well as the most watched overall series finale in U.S. TV history, behind the finales of \"M*A*S*H,\" \"Cheers,\" and \"Seinfeld.\" The series finale is the second most watched \"Friends\" episode, behind \"The One After the Superbowl\" which scored 52.92 million viewers.\n\nAfter being on and off as a couple since Season 1, Rachel and Ross got back together during the series finale. Rachel was supposed to move to Paris for work, but Ross chased after her and confessed his love for her at the airport. Rachel got on the plane -- but then she got off the plane, and surprised Ross at his apartment, where they kissed.\n\n\"The only thing we absolutely knew from very early on was that we had to get Ross and Rachel together,\" Crane said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly in 2014. \"We had dicked the audience around for 10 years with their 'will they or won't they,' and we didn't see any advantage in frustrating them.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Perry",

A critically acclaimed sitcom that propelled several of its actors to cult status and made the characters they essayed unforgettable in the hearts of millions around the world, Friends continues to be the toast of the Internet for some of the best one-liners ever spoken on television.\n\nThe show's fame has been such that in 2021, the prayers of millions of fans were answered when the official Friends Instagram account posted that the filming for a reunion special had been wrapped up. Fans of the immensely popular sitcom had been waiting for a long time for the reunion to take place. The special was eventually aired on 27 May 2021.\n\nThe reunion brought together the original cast, who appeared as themselves and not their beloved characters since it was not a Friends episode.\n\nNevertheless, fans got to see Jennifer Aniston (who played Rachel Green), Courteney Cox (Monica Geller), Lisa Kudrow (Phoebe Buffay), David Schwimmer (Ross Geller), Matt LeBlanc (Joey Tribbiani) and Matthew Perry (Chandler Bing) once again. They were joined by series creators David Crane and Marta Kauffman and host James Corden.\n\nA starry guest list comprising industry icons such as David Beckham, BTS, Justin Bieber, Cara Delevingne, Lady Gaga, Reese Witherspoon, Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt among others, were also part of the reunion special.\n\nWhile fans are surely excited about the 20th anniversary of the sitcom's conclusion, everyone will be missing Perry. The charming actor passed away on 28 October 2023 leaving millions of Chandler Bing fans heartbroken.\n\nNevertheless, memories must remain fond and, therefore, while we are excited to binge-watch Friends once again in celebration of the 20th year of ending, here are some of the best Friends one-liners we love and, perhaps, will get you warmed up in case you share out enthusiasm.\n\n\"I'm not so good with the advice...

Schwimmer revealed that he had pushed for the show to feature more people of colour\n\nCharlie Wheeler played by Aisha Tyler, centre, arrived in Barbados as Joey's girlfriend but left with Ross played by David Schwimmer\n\nMarta Kauffman in the back row, fourth from left, together with the cast of Friends\n\nSchwimmer revealed that he pushed for the show to feature more people of colour, which is why Ross ended up dating Julie (played by Asian American actress Lauren Tom) and Charlie (played by African American actress Aisha Tyler).\n\nThe show's creator Marta Kauffman has since apologised for Friends' whiteness, making a $4million donation to the African American Studies department at Brandeis University in Massachusetts.\n\nLisa Kudrow, who played Phoebe, recently said that if Friends was remade it 'would not be an all white cast, for sure.'\n\nFAT SHAMING\n\nA running joke throughout the show is that Monica, played by Courteney Cox, was overweight as a child and teenager.\n\nA joke that ran throughout the show is that Monica was overweight as a child and teenager. Above (left to right): Matthew Perry as Chandler Bing, Jennifer Aniston as Rachel Green, David Schwimmer as Ross Geller, and Courtney Cox as Monica Geller\n\nMonica, left, played by Courtney cox with Jennifer Aniston as Rachel attend a college party given by Ross and Chandler\n\nDuring one scene, the six friends are watching a home movie of 'fat Monica' and laugh at her. Defensive Monica claims the camera adds 10 pounds, resulting in Chandler joking 'so how many cameras are on you, then?'\n\nChandler first meets Monica when he is a teenager and although she likes him, he rejects her because of her size - only becoming interested once she had slimmed down.\n\nIn another episode Monica shows her friends her swimsuit from when she was overweight and they joke that it could be used to 'cover Connecticut when it rains.' The real joke is that 'fat Monica' is probably no more than a size 16.\n\nHOMOPHOBIA\n\nRoss's ex-wife Carole (Jane Sibbett) leaves him for another woman - Carol (Jessica Hecht).\n\nThe show was commended for featuring the women's lesbian wedding, yet it played out against the backdrop of Ross's refusal to accept that his ex-wife was really gay, considering her true sexuality an affront to his masculinity.\n\nRoss refused to accept that his ex-wife really was gay, considering her true sexuality an affront to his masculinity\n\nWhen Susan befriends Ross's second wife Emily (played by Helen Baxendale) he voices his fears that Susan will 'turn Emily gay.'\n\nChandler's sexuality is constantly questioned by others too, with his friends saying he has 'a quality' that makes him seem gay - Phoebe even writes a song about it!\n\nRoss shows his prejudice again when Rachel hires a male nanny Sandy (played by Freddie Prince Junior) for their daughter Emma.\n\nRoss insists that heterosexual Sandy 'has to be gay' and fires him for being 'too sensitive.'\n\nTRANSPHOBIA\n\nChandler (played by the late Matthew Perry) is estranged from his father - a drag performer who goes by the stage name of Helena Handbasket, but they reconnect just before his marriage to Monica.\n\nHelena played by Kathleen Turner (left) is ridiculed by the others, especially Monica's dad Jack, who treats her like a curiosity saying, 'I've never seen one before'\n\nHelena is misgendered throughout, something that the show's creators have since apologised for, acknowledging that the character would be considered transgender by today's standards\n\nAt the wedding Helena (played by Kathleen Turner) is wearing an evening gown, causing his ex-wife Nora (played by Morgan Fairchild) to ask 'Don't you have a bit too much penis to be wearing a dress like that?'\n\nHelena is ridiculed by the others, especially Monica's dad Jack, who treats her like a curiosity saying, 'I've never seen one before.'\n\nHelena is misgendered throughout, something that the show's creators have since apologised for, acknowledging that the character would be considered transgender by today's standards.\n\nROSS'S CONTROLLING BEHAVIOUR\n\nRoss and Rachel's on/off relationship is one of the main themes of Friends. Ross had been in love with Rachel (played by Jennifer Aniston) since high school and they end up back together in the final episode.\n\nHowever, across all ten series, he displays highly controlling and gaslighting behaviour towards Rachel.\n\nThe One with the List where Rachel discovers that Ross has made a pros and cons list and lists Rachel being 'just a waitress' as one of his reasons to not date her\n\nAfter Rachel lands a job at Bloomingdales he becomes insanely jealous of her good looking colleague Mark (Stephen Eckholdt) and constantly monitors their interactions\n\nWhen Rachel, played by Jennifer Aniston, suggested they 'take a break' he immediately sleeps with another woman.

Before adding 'Only joking.'\n\nActor Joey (played by Matt LeBlanc) is portrayed as good-looking, charming...and highly promiscuous.

His 'How you doin'?' pick up line became one of the show's catchphrases\n\nThe only problem is that the lothario doesn't treat his conquests very well.

When he discovers that she has had more partners than him and mentions her ex-boyfriend Paolo's 'animal magnetism,' he becomes angry.\n\nRoss asks Rachel how many men she has slept with. When he discovers that she has had more partners than him and mentions her ex-boyfriend Paolo's 'animal magnetism,' he becomes angry\n\nWhen Monica dates Richard (played by Tom Selleck) they have a similar conversation and Monica is made to feel like a tramp for having a lot boyfriends.\n\nGLORIFYING PORNOGRAPHY\n\nThe subject of porn crops up regularly on Friends. There's one episode called 'The One with The Free Porn,' where Joey and Chandler accidentally get free access to a pay per view porn channel and watch it endlessly.\n\n'The One with The Free Porn,' where Joey and Chandler accidentally get free access to a pay per view porn channel and watch it endlessly\n\nWhen Phoebe's twin sister Ursula is revealed to be a porn star, the others watch her movies and make jokes about it.

be shown to baby Emma on her 18th birthday.\n\nSTUDENT DATING\n\nCollege professor Ross famously dated student Elizabeth (Alexandra Holden) even though he knew it was not all allowed and could get him fired.\n\nRoss, played by David Schwimmer, famously dated student Elizabeth (Alexandra Holden) even though he knew it was not all allowed\n\nElizabeth is 12 years younger than Ross and despite the fact he is her teacher, he revels in the sexiness of their relationship - saying the forbidden element makes it arousing.\n\nIn true controlling Ross style, when she plans to go away on a spring break he decides to join her so that that she can't flirt with younger guys.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

However, in the next shot Phoebe is sitting on a chair on the other side of the room drinking coffee.\n\nNow, eagle-eyed watchers have also picked up on a blunder made by Courtney Cox, who plays Monica, in season four.\n\nIn the episode called The One With the Embryos, Monica and Rachel take on Joey and Chandler in a game to see which team knows the other one better. Ross is game master and comes up with a series of personal questions for each team to answer about the other players.\n\nFrom favourite film, to romance, family, and even guessing what is in Rachel's shopping bag, the competition gets heated and leaves the audience in stitches. It has been rated time and time again as one of the best episodes of the entire series.\n\nThe grand prize ends up becoming the girls' apartment and whoever wins, gets to live there. It ends with Chandler and Joey being victorious, and the guys swapping apartments.\n\nHowever, a Reddit user realised upon re-watching that Courteney Cox, who plays Monica, seemingly messed up one of her lines after the game. Writing on the How You Doin forum, the fan said: \"I can't believe I never noticed this before, it's my favourite episode, I've seen it so many times!\n\n\"Just after the guys win the trivia game when Rachel is refusing to move, Monica says 'if we had lost, we would have made them get rid of the birds, right? It doesn't make sense. They did lose. She was probably supposed to say 'if they had lost' or 'if we had won', right?\"\n\nFans have been left gobsmacked by the error.

Deleted scenes show the couple being detained at the airport after Chandler made a poorly timed joke about bombs.\n\nChandler spotted a sign that said joking about aircraft hijacking and bombings are a federal crime, but obviously he couldn't resist. He told a steward: \"You don't have to worry about me, ma'am. I take my bombs very seriously!\"\n\nLater on in the episode, Monica also made a joke about their \"entire apartment blowing up\" - given the tragedy that had just hit America, bosses made a smart decision to keep it out.\n\nJennifer Aniston almost quit\n\nIt would be almost impossible for anyone to imagine the final season of Friends without one of the main characters of the show, but this was almost a reality for fans back in 2004.\n\nJennifer Aniston almost left the show and her role as the iconic Rachel Green back in the early 2000s\n\nShe was so important that the finale focussed almost entirely on her relationship with Ross Geller, but this may not have been the case if Aniston's decision had gone a different way.\n\nJennifer spoke to NBC back in 2004 and admitted that she had \"a couple of issues\" that she was dealing with.\n\nAniston also said that she would have preferred the series ended while people \"still loved them\" and confessed that she wasn't sure how much of Rachel she had left in her.\n\nShe was worried about the quality of the series and her character declining if they continued to work on new series. Luckily she stayed on and wrapped the final season with her fellow co-stars.\n\nChandler and Phoebe?\n\nWithout Bing's sarcasm and Buffay's kookiness, Friends would have been a completely different show.\n\nThankfully, the series creators scrapped the idea of Matthew Perry and Lisa Kudrow's characters being secondary roles as the original idea was to have Rachel, Ross, Monica and Joey as the main stars.\n\nIn a mini-documentary released in 2005, co-creator of the series Marta Kauffman revealed that Chandler and Phoebe were supposed to be \"a little more secondary,\" acting as comic relief for the viewers.\n\nExecutive producer Kevin S. Bright also said that the decision to keep them as primary characters was made financially - the producers of the show weren't keen to pay for guest stars.\n\nFat Monica\n\nA reoccurring storyline throughout Friends was a throwback to their highschool years with some very questionable hairstyles and ever worse outfits.\n\nSet in the 80s, the friends looked noticeably different but one stood out more than most.\n\nCourtney Cox wore a fat suit and facial prosthetics when she played her character's younger self, but since the 90s many fans of the show have called out Friends for the \"fatphobic\" portrayal.\n\nShe was used as a scapegoat for \"cheap laughs\" whenever the flashbacks focussed on her and her younger self's actions were greatly exaggerated.\n\nIn an alternate opening sequence for the show, \"Fat Monica\" was supposed to hop onto the couch which then tipped over onto the floor.\n\nIn the two-part episode The One That Could Have Been, younger Monica never lost the weight and remained a virgin.\n\nThroughout the same episode, \"Fat Monica\" also became very concerned that someone sat on her chocolate bar.\n\nThe Male Nanny\n\nControversy surrounded the series when Sandy the male nanny came into their lives.\n\nRachel and Ross are on the hunt for a nanny and Sandy seems like the perfect candidate - to Rachel.\n\nRoss is uncomfortable with the idea of their nanny being a man, which has upset viewers since the time of the episode's release.\n\nWant all the biggest Showbiz and TV news straight to your inbox? Sign up for our free Daily Star Showbiz newsletter.\n\nSandy shows his emotional side and it is revealed that he is extremely sensitive and cries a lot.\n\nRoss ends up firing Sandy and Friends came under fire for reinforcing negative stereotypes regarding his role. Men have and continue to face discrimination in that line of business and the notion that men who babysit are overtly \"feminine\" or \"sensitive\" is false.", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bekka_barnard@dailystar.co.uk", "name": "Bekka Barnard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Green", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler_Bing", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chandler Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Aniston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Perry", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Perry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Kudrow", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lisa Kudrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_LeBlanc", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt LeBlanc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Schwimmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Schwimmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Geller", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ross Geller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeymoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Honeymoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Star_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Star (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoebe_Buffay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoebe Buffay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcasm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sarcasm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_hijacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft hijacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tragedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_attendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight attendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_S._Bright", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin S.

This was pop culture history.\n\nBut should 6th May 2004 have been a moment, really? Should Friends have stuck around long enough to hit that 10th season and wind things up the way they did?\n\nWell, after growing up with Friends as my go-to pre-sleep watch, then growing older, more jaded and more analytical, it's become blindingly obvious that it shouldn't - Friends should have come to a close three years earlier.\n\nOf course, if you look at any list of the 'best Friends moments', plenty of quotable late-season scenes come up: \"Joey doesn't share food!\", \"Princess Consuela Banana Hammock\", \"It's the humidity!\".\n\nBut for all that these have wormed their way into the zeitgeist, and were delivered by master comedians at the top of their game, the real genius of Friends was its ability to deliver such memorable moments while telling a genuinely interesting story - which, if we're being honest, died a death several years before the show itself did.\n\nThink back to season 1 - for me, the strongest of the lot - and the genius of Friends is in full view. There are undoubtedly moments of comedic brilliance throughout the season - Rachel's stand-off with a foul-mannered laundromat customer; Chandler's Trident quip - but all of the jokes are underpinned by layers beyond the humorous.\n\nBuilding episodes around a group of 20-somethings struggling to find their way in the world, feeling lost, epitomising the very lyrics of The Rembrandts' title track I'll Be There for You, it felt like those early episodes really had something to say beyond punchy lines of dialogue.\n\nWhether it was a young Monica feeling inadequate compared to her superstar brother in The One Where Nana Dies Twice, Chandler overcoming hurdles with his mother in The One with Mrs Bing or Ross coming to terms with becoming a parent himself in The One with Two Parts: Part 2, each episode in season 1 explored the trials and tribulations of entering adulthood feeling unprepared, out of your depth.\n\nThis commitment to complex storytelling continued through several seasons after this, despite the characters increasingly coming into their own in both their personal and professional lives. Joey's acting career explores the impact that a rise to stardom can have on those who aren't ready for the limelight. Phoebe's pregnancy journey examines the fallout that can come from making sacrifices for the people you care about.\n\nAnd through the blossoming romance between Chandler and Monica, there's a central romance that overtakes every other subplot in terms of its allure. Their relationship feels fleshed out, their companionship feels genuine. They share jokes and jibes, they push each other and have real conversations - Monica's, \"If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one,\" line is an all-timer.\n\nIn finding someone like Monica, who strives for greatness and perfection - to a fault at times - Chandler grows from an aloof doof who's terrified of commitment into someone who's willing to sacrifice his entire life's savings to make his partner happy (a poor financial choice, perhaps, but definitely an impressive display of being all-in).\n\nAnd through her bond with Chandler, we see Monica gradually lose her more destructive type-A quirks, learning that she doesn't always have to be the best at everything, because she has someone who will always be there to maintain her high-maintenance personality.\n\nFor all the talk of the 'lobsters', Ross and Rachel, it's 'Mondler' that provides the most interesting relationship, the one that makes the most sense and most effectively hooks the viewers in (if you weren't in tears during the engagement episode, you are, like Chandler, dead inside). And that's why their wedding, the final episode of season 7, should have brought this whole show to a close.\n\nThink beyond this episode, and what happens? Friends loses its genius, it runs out of ideas. Central characters no longer develop as people, plots increasingly feel like filler, jokes become more one-note.\n\nLook at Joey. In the early seasons, he's a loveable if naive guy who might not be the smartest but still has moments of substance. Sure, he's the mate whose initial suggestion for overcoming marital breakdown is to head to a strip club, but he's also the mate who ultimately urges Ross to \"grab a spoon\".\n\nCut to season 10, and that episode Where Joey Speaks French, and it's almost painful to see how far the character has regressed. Matt LeBlanc has to shift from playing a charming fool to encompassing something of a man-child - almost literally so, when Monica and Chandler announce that they're moving home.\n\nEven Monica, so often a lynchpin for Friends' deeper moments, is let down, with much of Courteney Cox's contributions collapsing into simply yelling one-liners in her then-trademark high-pitched tone.\n\nToo large a chunk of those final few seasons is centred around Ross and Rachel, especially in the closing episodes, even though very little is done to establish that they are even compatible, let alone soulmates.\n\nRoss's controlling behaviour hardly eases as time progresses - the infamous episode with the male nanny proving a prime example - and Rachel demonstrates that she has much more fun going on dinner dates with Joey than she does spending time with Ross.\n\nThe series's final few minutes, focusing on whether or not Rachel gets off a plane now or simply hops on a later return flight to New York, hit home more than they might have done - largely thanks to the performances of Schwimmer and Aniston - and the closing moments gave us Matthew Perry's apparently ad-libbed \"Where?\" finisher, but ultimately that episode 20 years ago should never have happened.", "source": {"uri": "radiotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The taping lasted over 8 hours, they ordered pizza for us for dinner. I didn't leave my seat for a second of the taping because I didn't want to miss anything.\n\n'Before the taping started they showed us the season finale from season 7 to remind us what happened. They also had a comedian entertain us before and during filming breaks. They tossed a bunch of Friends merchandise out to the crowd.'\n\nUser u/BeachBlonde22 said that when they attended a taping in 1995, they were 'exhausted' when it kept going until 2am - and were also distracted by Jennifer's then-boyfriend Tate Donovan (who played Joshua on the sitcom) sitting right next to them.\n\nU/pad_rad added: 'From memory it started late afternoon and finished at about 2am. It took a long time.' Wowzers!\n\nIn the world of showbusiness... you've got to be ready for anything that comes your way.\n\nThat sentiment must have certainly been felt when the crew members working on the set of Friends had to deal with someone vomiting in the audience due to excitement.\n\nReddit user u/ashortergiraffe explained that they heard about the incident, as it happened to someone that they knew who was at a taping.\n\n'Not me, but my sister's middle school best friend's sister went once. She was so excited she actually threw up,' they wrote.\n\n'I specifically remember her saying that one of the people handling the audience just shouted \"We got a puker!,\" and escorted her out.'\n\nRoss' monkey Marcel made his debut on Friends in season one, with the character eventually having to give him up because he had reached sexual maturity and humping pretty much everything in sight.\n\nWhile the monkey was misbehaving on the show, it turns out that the real capuchin monkey was also apparently mischievous in real life.\n\n'My parents went to a taping for the first season, they saw S1 E17,' said u/UnKnOwN769, in reference to the episode The One with Two Parts, Part Two.\n\nIn that particular episode, Marcel is rushed to the hospital by Ross, Chandler and Joey when he accidentally swallows a Scrabble tile.\n\n'They said there were some issues with Ross' pet monkey and that it wasn't cooperating very well,' the Reddit user said.\n\nDuring the 2021 Friends reunion, David admitted he had difficulty working with his simian co-star, stating: 'The monkey would mess up scenes and when it didn't do its job right, we would have to go again over and over. The monkey didn't hit its mark, I'm sorry.'\n\nWhen you think about the best episodes of Friends, there are some that certainly stand out. And the 'pivot' episode - when Ross develops a very unique way of shrieking the word at Chandler and Rachel while trying to hoist a sofa up his stairs.\n\nIf you thought that episode was hysterical already, especially when Chandler yells at Ross to 'shut up' in a hilarious imitation of his college friend, apparently it was even funnier behind the scenes.\n\n'I was in the audience for TOW the Cop (the 'pivot' episode),' said u/pad_rad.\n\n'It was all filmed in front of the audience except the very first scene, where Joey's dreaming. That had been filmed before we arrived and we watched it on screens before they started filming the rest of the episode.'\n\nThey continued: 'The pivot scene was even funnier than it looks in the bloopers. Everyone was in hysterics.'\n\nThe Friends fan added: 'It was a great night and I feel very lucky to have experienced it.'\n\nNowadays, TV fans are warned to avoid social media at all costs before they've watched the latest episodes of shows in case they accidentally stumble across spoilers.\n\nBut back when Friends was in production, this apparently wasn't as much of a concern, to the extent that audience members in the studio were seemingly not even warned about spilling the beans to other members of the public.\n\n'I don't remember them saying anything about spoilers. The internet wasn't a big problem back then,' u/pad_rad said.\n\nCan you imagine being in the audience when it was revealed that Rachel was pregnant, or when Ross accidentally said Rachel's name at his wedding to Emily, or when Monica proposed to Chandler... and not being warned to keep it under wraps?!\n\nHow lucky all of those Friends fans were who got to be a part of TV history.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we'd love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Netflix show's most expensive house just sold - but not for its $28,000,000 listing price\n\nMORE : Kim Kardashian gets mercilessly booed trying to roast comedy legend", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sabrina_barr@metro.co.uk", "name": "Sabrina Barr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_audience", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Studio audience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Perry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Perry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler_Bing", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chandler Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monkey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pizza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Schwimmer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David Schwimmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisbee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frisbee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_One_(Friends)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Last One (Friends)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laugh_track", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laugh track"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_LeBlanc", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt LeBlanc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoebe_Buffay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoebe Buffay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Aniston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Kudrow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lisa Kudrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courteney_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Courteney Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apartment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tate_Donovan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tate Donovan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Green", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season_finale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Season finale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Show business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfume", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perfume"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuff_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stuff (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If...?_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "What If...?

O May 6, 2004, we all watched \"The Last One,\" or \"The One Where They Say Goodbye,\" or for some of us, \"The One Where We Can't Stop Crying.\" We left Monica's iconic, enormous apartment empty, realizing along with Joey that the apartment was actually purple all along. Monica and Chandler had just watched Erica give birth to their adopted twins and were getting ready to embark on parenthood. Something Ross and Rachel, back together (for good this time, we assume) know a little something about. Now, 20 years after the fact, the babies of Friends are adults and we want to know what they would be doing today. So here are our totally reasonable if vaguely unhinged theories on what these babies are all doing right now.\n\nJack Bing is basically a mini Chandler.\n\nJack and Erica Bing, Chandler and Monica's adopted twins, are now 20 years old. A fraught age, an age of self discovery. Jack probably followed in his father's footsteps and tried desperately to find a college course for becoming a \"transponster,\" Rachel's definition of Chandler's epically boring job, and was shocked to discover it doesn't exist. At which point he decided to dedicate his life to his real love, comedy. Jack Bing is, after all, a great name for a stand-up comedian. Monica and Chandler take the train into the city to watch Jack perform at open mic nights, Monica's face tight with a fake smile and Chandler muttering \"could this BE more awkward?\" Much as she did when Chandler decided he wanted to work in advertising, Monica supports her son and hopes he just tires himself out. She also visits once a week to clean his apartment and is always delighted to find that he, like his mother, is a sucker for an organized kitchen.\n\nErica Bing has perfected her mom's chocolate chip cookies.\n\nErica has taken over her mother's old apartment after Monica and Chandler bought it in the 2008 mortgage crisis for a song, and she's given it a fresh update by whitewashing the walls. Much like her birth mother, who we can call Erica Sr., I guess, Erica Bing is not terribly interested in college. Instead, Erica spends her time learning about Reiki and art therapy, hosting friends in her apartment for tarot card readings on Wednesdays. Erica's real focus is baking, and she has been considering taking over Central Perk to sell her incredible cookies. Chocolate chip cookies, to be precise, which are so good that Monica keeps trying to figure out the secret. Much as she did with Phoebe years earlier.\n\nEmma Geller-Green is living La Vie En Rose.\n\nEmma Geller-Green, daughter of Rachel and Ross, lives in Paris. She went to Paris with her grandmother Sandra to wait for her mother Rachel to join them for her job. Instead, her parents got back together. As Sandra and Emma were already in the City of Lights, Ross and Rachel decided to enjoy a little time alone, a delayed honeymoon if you will. While they were bonding, Sandra and Emma were falling in love with Paris. Sandra took the money from her divorce from Rachel's dad years earlier and bought them an apartment. Emma split her time between New York and Paris for years, but ended up settling in the Latin Quarter and working in a local cafe as a barista to support her shopping habits. Her mom Rachel visits constantly, preferring 22-year-old Emma's chic Paris lifestyle over joining Ross on paleontology digs.\n\nBen Geller is totally hosting a prank show.\n\nBen Geller is 28 years old, and you've probably heard of him. He has the most popular gag reality show since Jackass. Ben's uncle Chandler frequently needles him to be included on his gag show, but so far he hasn't gotten a guest appearance. Ross, however, is frequently getting punked by Ben and he kind of hates it even though he's a fan favorite. Ben films all over the country, traveling in his motorhome mom Carol and stepmom Susan bought him, and his other stepmom Rachel is a frequent consultant on his gag show. It's how they bond.\n\nFrank Buffay Jr. is Phoebe's right-hand man.\n\nFrank Buffay Jr., son of Alice and Frank Buffay, has never really gotten over the fact that his aunt Phoebe was his surrogate. He loves it, and even at 26 years old lives with Phoebe and her husband Mike in an apartment in their converted barn. While Phoebe and Mike's own daughter Regina \"Gina\" Phalange (named for her mother's old alter ego) is getting ready to go off to college, Frank Jr. is content to be Phoebe's handyman. It's an arrangement that works for everyone, as neither Phoebe nor Mike are terribly interested in doing home repairs and they bought an old farm that is constantly falling apart.\n\nLeslie Buffay is nanny to the stars.\n\nLeslie Buffay grew up feeling like the forgotten triplet on account of frequently being forgotten by her parents. Because of this, Leslie decided to become a childcare professional and studied to be a nanny. Now she is working in Montecito, where she is nanny to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's two children, Archie and Lilibet, and it's even rumored that the American Riviera Orchard jam was her idea.\n\nChandler Buffay is carrying on the \"Smelly Cat\" tradition.\n\nFinally, Chandler Buffay found her own way to honor her aunt Phoebe. She has made a career for herself as a folk singer in Portland, Oregon, where she often covers some of her aunt's most under-appreciated songs. Her live version of \"Smelly Cat\" has been known to bring her fans to tears, especially Phoebe. She played at Coachella this year, inviting her uncle Mike on stage to play piano, and the entire gang showed up to watch her perform. So this would be \"The One Where 'Smelly Cat' Becomes A Hit.\"\n\nAs much as we love speculating on where these babies are now that they're all in their 20s, we would not be opposed to a reboot. Especially now that we've given the Friends' creators some ideas on where everyone might be today.", "source": {"uri": "romper.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Romper"}, "authors": [{"uri":

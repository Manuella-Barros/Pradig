The case, which has garnered widespread attention, involves the brutal murder of 33-year-old Renukaswamy, a fan of Darshan, under harrowing circumstances.\n\nAlso Read: Darshan's wife Vijayalakshmi clarifies to Bengaluru police: I am his legally wedded wife, Pavithra Gowda is a friend\n\nIncident Overview\n\nRenukaswamy, a native of Chitradurga, was found dead near a stormwater drain next to an apartment in Sumanahalli on June 9. The post-mortem report revealed that he died due to shock and hemorrhage caused by multiple blunt injuries. According to police sources, Renukaswamy had sent obscene messages to Pavithra Gowda, a friend of Darshan, which allegedly enraged the actor, leading to the tragic incident.\n\nDetails of the Case\n\nThe case took a gruesome turn when it was revealed that Raghavendra, one of the accused and a member of Darshan's fan club in Chitradurga, lured Renukaswamy to a shed in RR Nagar on the pretext of meeting the actor. It was in this shed that Renukaswamy was allegedly tortured and subsequently murdered. The police investigation has pointed to Pavithra Gowda as the \"major cause\" of Renukaswamy's murder, with accusations that she instigated the other accused, conspired with them, and actively participated in the crime.\n\nJudicial Proceedings\n\nAll 17 accused, including Darshan and Pavithra, were produced before the magistrate through video conferencing from Bengaluru and Tumakuru prisons, where they are currently lodged. The court, considering the severity of the crime and the ongoing investigation, decided to extend their judicial custody. This decision ensures that the accused remain in custody while further inquiries and legal proceedings continue.\n\nImpact and Public Reaction\n\nThe murder case has sent shockwaves through the Kannada film industry and the broader community, drawing attention to the darker aspects of celebrity-fan relationships. The involvement of a prominent actor like Darshan has added a layer of complexity and public interest, with many awaiting further developments and justice for Renukaswamy.\n\nLegal Implications and Next Steps\n\nThe extension of judicial custody indicates that the investigation is still active, and more evidence is likely being gathered. The police and legal teams are expected to delve deeper into the motives, actions, and roles of each accused individual. The case has also highlighted the need for stricter laws and measures to protect individuals from such violent outcomes, especially when influential personalities are involved.\n\nAs the judicial process unfolds, the court's decision to extend custody till July 18 reflects the seriousness with which the case is being handled. The accused will have to remain in jail as the legal proceedings move forward, ensuring that justice is served in this high-profile and tragic case.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kannada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darshan_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darshan (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detention_(imprisonment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detention (imprisonment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijayalakshmi_(Kannada_actress)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vijayalakshmi (Kannada actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitradurga", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chitradurga"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chitradurga"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obscenity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kannada cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magistrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumkur", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tumkur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tumkur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2024/07/20240704155243_FotoJet-2024-07-04T212234.258.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706226", "eventUri": "eng-9706226", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-09", "textStart": 921, "textEnd": 927}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 3103, "textEnd": 3110}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-07-", "textStart": 182, "textEnd": 189, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.4823529411764705, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

Dayananda.

This information was confirmed by police sources on Thursday.\n\nAccording to News18, in her letter to Police Commissioner Dayananda, Vijayalakshmi expressed her concern over a significant error made during a press conference. She pointed out that Commissioner Dayananda incorrectly referred to Pavithra Gowda as Darshan's wife. This mistake was subsequently echoed by the Karnataka Home Minister and reported by national media outlets, which inaccurately stated that the \"Darshan couple\" was arrested in connection with the Renukaswamy murder case.\n\nVijayalakshmi's letter also included a request to the police commissioner, urging him to correct the records and refrain from identifying Pavithra Gowda as Darshan's wife. She highlighted the potential repercussions of such an error, emphasizing that it could cause future difficulties for both her and her son, Vineesh. To ensure accuracy, Vijayalakshmi stressed that Pavithra Gowda is, in fact, married to Sanjay Singh and has a daughter with him. She insisted that these facts be correctly reflected in the police records to prevent any misunderstandings or issues moving forward.\n\n\"I have full faith in the judiciary and believe the law will take its course. While it is true that Pavithra Gowda is a friend of my husband, she is not his wife.

In the letter, submitted on June 25, Ms. Vijayalakshmi said Pavithra Gowda is a friend of Darshan and not wife, as wrongly stated by Mr. Dayananda while briefing the media earlier, which has been reiterated even by the Home Minister. \"I am the only legally wedded wife and our marriage was solemnised at Dharmasthala in May 2003,\" she said in the letter.\n\nShe said that wrongly mentioning the relationship may cause difficulties for her and her son in the future and requested Mr. Dayananda to set the police records straight.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SIM card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darshan_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darshan (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kannada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detention_(imprisonment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detention (imprisonment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magistrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karthik_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karthik (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Home_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Home Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmasthala", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dharmasthala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharmasthala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/cw45qo/article68368047.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_Darshan_Toogudeepa_2_1_3LCTVTNU.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706226", "eventUri": "eng-9706226", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 144, "textEnd": 151}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-25", "textStart": 1622, "textEnd": 1629}, {"amb": false, "date": "2003-05-", "textStart": 1914, "textEnd": 1922}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Read on to find more details.\n\nThe judge supervised the court proceedings of the 17 accused individuals through a video conference from their holding cells in Bengaluru and Tumakuru. This happened as their period of confinement wrapped up this Thursday. Darshan, Gowda, and 11 others were rounded up on June 11th for their implicated involvement in the death of a local Chitradurga citizen, Renukaswamy. In the following investigation, four more suspects were also arrested.\n\nThe prosecution's representative expressed his concern that letting them out of jail could obstruct the ongoing investigations since there is more information the police still need to accumulate about the incident. The prosecuting side also made allegations that these individuals had tried in the past to meddle with evidence - be it digital, physical, or scientific in nature. This suggests their lack of respect for the nation's legal framework.\n\nIn the court proceedings, it was brought to light that the person charged had been discovered with Rs 83.65 lakh in cash. It surfaced that they had interacted with various people before, while, and after committing the alleged crime, using cell phone numbers registered under different identities.

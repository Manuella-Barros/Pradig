Watch Boeing launch its first astronaut mission for NASA after years-long delays due to leaks and repairs", "body": "After years of delays, Boeing has finally launched its first NASA mission carrying two astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nAt 10:52 ET (15:52 BST) on Wednesday, the Boeing CST-100 Starliner took off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\n\nThe shuttle, and astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, are expected to arrive at 12:15 ET (17:15 BST) on Thursday after a 25-hour flight.\n\nIf successful, this test flight will give NASA a second commercial shuttle alongside the SpaceX Dragon and end Boeing's run of failed launches.\n\nBut while the capsule has completed its initial tests, NASA now says the craft has sprung two unexpected helium leaks since entering orbit.\n\nAfter years of delays, Boeing's Starliner has finally launched on its first NASA mission carrying two astronauts to the ISS\n\nShortly before the astronauts (pictured) were scheduled to sleep mission control informed them that there another helium leak had been detected on the shuttle\n\nStarliner was launched aboard a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas-V rocket, marking the first time that ULA has launched a crewed mission.\n\nThe rocket used its primary booster for just over four minutes to get Starliner into the air before jettisoning the bottom section and switching to a second stage.\n\nAfter 12 minutes of burn-time to get the capsule into orbit, the rocket then detached, leaving Starliner to navigate using its own thrusters.\n\nAs part of the test flight, the crew also carried out around two hours of 'free flight' time to test the Starliner's manual controls.\n\nStarliner was spun around in orbit to test the solar panels, communications devices, and star trackers which are used for emergency navigation.\n\nHowever, the capsule's automatic navigation systems mean that Wilmore and Williams will now function largely as passengers for the majority of their flight.\n\nAt 10:52 ET (15:52 BST) the Boeing CST-100 Starliner took off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida\n\nBoeing launched its very first astronauts bound for the International Space Station aboard a Starliner capsule, which joins a select club of spacecraft to carry humans beyond Earth\n\nBoeing's Starliner spacecraft is pictured approaching the ISS in May 2022, during 'Orbital Flight Test 2' (no humans on board)\n\nBoeing's Starliner: Key specs\n\nManufacturer: Boeing\n\nApplications: ISS crew and cargo\n\nLaunch mass: 13,000 kg\n\nCrew capacity: Up to 7\n\nDiameter: 15 feet (4.56 metres)\n\nDesign life: 210 days docked\n\nAfter docking with the ISS and delivering 139 kg (307lbs) of supplies for NASA, the pair will spend a little more than a week aboard the station.\n\nThe capsule is scheduled to return to Earth in a remote desert area of the US on June 14.\n\nBut while the initial tests have been successful, NASA now reports that Starliner has developed three helium leaks.\n\nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, NASA wrote: 'Teams have identified three helium leaks on the spacecraft.\n\nOne of these leaks had been identified on the ground but mission control determined that the shuttle was still safe to fly.\n\nAs the Wilmore and Williams were preparing to sleep, mission control told the astronauts that that it 'looks like we picked up a couple more helium leaks.'\n\n'We are ready to...find out exactly what you mean by \"picked up another helium leak\", so give it to us,' Wilmore replied.\n\nThe capsule was launched on a United Launch Alliance (ULA)Atlas-V rocket. This is the first time that a ULA rocket has carried a crew to space\n\nButch Wilmore and Suni Williams will be transported to International Space Station (ISS) and spend about a week there before heading home\n\n'Boeing Crew Flight Test' - a long-awaited milestone - is the first launch of Starliner that contains astronauts\n\nHowever, mission control responded that they were 'still getting the story together.'\n\nNASA has since determined that the crew is safe and the astronauts continued to sleep as scheduled.\n\nBoeing aerospace engineer Brandon Burroughs said on the NASA broadcast: 'We have a lot of smart people down here on the ground that are going to take a look at this stuff and keep an eye on it, but the vehicle is in a configuration right now where they're safe to fly.'\n\nIt is not clear whether these leaks will lead to any serious issues but it appears that Starliner is still on track to dock with the ISS later on Thursday.\n\nThe launch comes more than a decade since Boeing was first awarded the $4.2 billion contract to develop the Starliner capsule and seven years since its intended launch.\n\nAboard the shuttle were veteran NASA astronauts Suni Williams (left) and commander Butch Wilmore (right)\n\nThis is the third time in a month that the two astronauts have attempted to launch aboard the Starliner, with two earlier attempts called off shortly before takeoff\n\nBoeing's Starliner launches\n\nDecember 2019 First uncrewed flight. Reached orbit but failed to dock with ISS\n\nMay 2022 Second uncrewed flight. Successfully docked with ISS\n\nJune 2024 First crewed flight to ISS\n\nAn attempt on May 6 was called off just two hours before launch due to an audible 'buzzing' caused by valve issues.\n\nAnother launch attempt last Saturday was halted with less than four minutes to go due to a technical glitch with a launchpad computer.\n\nIf the craft safely returns to Earth, this will mark a significant step forward for Boeing's ambition in the commercial space sector and put pressure on rival SpaceX.\n\nThe launch's success will also come as relief for NASA who are increasingly relying on commercial providers for travel into space.\n\nAfter NASA's Space Shuttle Atlantis was retired in 2011, the American space agency was forced to pay around $80m (\u00a364m) for a seat in a Russian Soyuz capsule to reach the ISS.\n\nBut after 13 years, NASA's Commercial Crew Program (CCP) could finally have two different options to send astronauts to the ISS.\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson told a post-launch press conference that this was another milestone in this extraordinary history of NASA'.\n\nMr Nelson added: 'With Dragon and Starliner, the US is going to have two unique human space transportation systems. We always like to have a backup that makes it safer for our astronauts.'\n\nA helium leak had been detected on the ground before launch but it was deemed that the mission was still safe to go ahead\n\nThe Starliner can carry a maximum of seven astronauts and can be re-used up to ten times after being refurbished between launches\n\nIn a brief speech moments before takeoff, Wilmore thanked those who had worked to make the mission possible and alluded to the project's tumultuous progress.\n\nHe said: 'We all know that when the going gets tough, and it often does, the tough get going, and Suni and I are honoured to share this dream of spaceflight with each and every one of you.'\n\nNASA has already ordered six more astronaut rotation flights to the space station as part of the CCP.\n\nThe Starliner itself also represents significant advancements in shuttle technology.\n\nUsing a 'weldless' design the CST-100 (which stands for Crew Space Transportation) should reduce the risk of structural failure.\n\nAlthough it will typically transport four passengers the Starliner can take up to seven astronauts and can be reused up to ten times with six months of refurbishment between flights.\n\nMark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing's Commercial Crew Program, says: 'Everyone is focused on giving Suni and Butch a safe, comfortable ride and performing a successful test mission from start to finish.'\n\nFamous for manufacturing commercial airplanes, Boeing has been under heavy scrutiny in recent months after a chunk of fuselage blew out of one of its new 737s.\n\nThe firm has been blocked from increasing production of the plane as it addresses ongoing safety issues.\n\nIt seems some experts were concerned about Starliner too, as one NASA contractor has warned the mission could be 'catastrophic' on the basis that the craft has sprung a leak.\n\nEXPLAINED: THE $100 BILLION INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION SITS 250 MILES ABOVE THE EARTH\n\nThe International Space Station (ISS) is a $100 billion (\u00a380 billion) science and engineering laboratory that orbits 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.\n\nIt has been permanently staffed by rotating crews of astronauts and cosmonauts since November 2000.\n\nCrews have come mainly from the US and Russia, but the Japanese space agency JAXA and European space agency ESA have also sent astronauts.\n\nThe International Space Station has been continuously occupied for more than 20 years and has been expended with multiple new modules added and upgrades to systems\n\nResearch conducted aboard the ISS often requires one or more of the unusual conditions present in low Earth orbit, such as low-gravity or oxygen.\n\nISS studies have investigated human research, space medicine, life sciences, physical sciences, astronomy and meteorology.\n\nThe US space agency, NASA, spends about $3 billion (\u00a32.4 billion) a year on the space station program, with the remaining funding coming from international partners, including Europe, Russia and Japan.\n\nSo far 244 individuals from 19 countries have visited the station, and among them eight private citizens who spent up to $50 million for their visit.\n\nThere is an ongoing debate about the future of the station beyond 2025, when it is thought some of the original structure will reach 'end of life'.\n\nRussia, a major partner in the station, plans to launch its own orbital platform around then, with Axiom Space, a private firm, planning to send its own modules for purely commercial use to the station at the same time.\n\nNASA, ESA, JAXA and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) are working together to build a space station in orbit around the moon, and Russia and China are working on a similar project, that would also include a base on the surface.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test is the first launch with astronauts of the Boeing CFT-100 spacecraft and United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket to the International Space Station as part of the agency's Commercial Crew Program. The flight test, which launched at 10:52 a.m. EDT, serves as an end-to-end demonstration of Boeing's crew transportation system and will carry NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to and from the orbiting laboratory. Credit: NASA/Joel Kowsky\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are orbiting aboard Boeing's Starliner on its inaugural crewed flight to the ISS, where they will conduct system tests and participate in public outreach, underlining NASA's commitment to commercial space partnerships.\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are safely in orbit on the first crewed flight test aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft bound for the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nAs part of NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test, the astronauts lifted off at 10:52 a.m. EDT on Wednesday on a ULA (United Launch Alliance) Atlas V rocket from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida on an end-to-end test of the Starliner system.\n\n\"Two bold NASA astronauts are well on their way on this historic first test flight of a brand-new spacecraft,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \"Boeing's Starliner marks a new chapter of American exploration. Human spaceflight is a daring task - but that's why it's worth doing. It's an exciting time for NASA, our commercial partners, and the future of exploration. Go Starliner, Go Butch and Suni!\"\n\nAs part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, the flight test will help validate the transportation system, launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, in-orbit operations capabilities, and return to Earth with astronauts aboard as the agency prepares to certify Starliner for rotational missions to the space station. Starliner previously flew two uncrewed orbital flights, including a test to and from the space station, along with a pad abort demonstration.\n\n\"With Starliner's launch, separation from the rocket, and arrival on orbit, Boeing's Crew Flight Test is right on track,\" said Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing's Commercial Crew Program. \"Everyone is focused on giving Suni and Butch a safe, comfortable, ride and performing a successful test mission from start to finish.\"\n\nDuring Starliner's flight, Boeing will monitor a series of automatic spacecraft maneuvers from its mission control center in Houston. NASA teams will monitor space station operations throughout the flight from the Mission Control Center at the agency's Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n\n\"Flying crew on Starliner represents over a decade of work by the Commercial Crew Program and our partners at Boeing and ULA,\" said Steve Stich, manager, Commercial Crew Program, at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. \"For many of us, this is a career-defining moment bringing on a new crew transportation capability for our agency and our nation. We are going to take it one step at a time, putting Starliner through its paces, and remaining vigilant until Butch and Suni safely touch down back on Earth at the conclusion of this test flight.\"\n\nStarliner will autonomously dock to the forward-facing port of the station's Harmony module at approximately 12:15 p.m. Thursday, June 6, and remain at the orbital laboratory for about a week.\n\nWilmore and Williams will help verify the spacecraft is performing as intended by testing the environmental control system, the displays and control system, and by maneuvering the thrusters, among other tests during flight.\n\nAfter a safe arrival at the space station, Wilmore and Williams will join the Expedition 71 crew of NASA astronauts Michael Barratt, Matt Dominick, Tracy C. Dyson, and Jeanette Epps, and Roscosmos cosmonauts Nikolai Chub, Alexander Grebenkin, and Oleg Kononenko.\n\nNASA's arrival and in-flight event coverage is as follows (all times Eastern and subject to change based on real-time operations):\n\nMission coverage will continue on NASA Television channels throughout Starliner's flight and resume on NASA+ prior to docking.\n\n3:30 p.m. - Post-docking news conference at NASA Johnson with the following participants:\n\nCoverage of the post-docking news conference will air live on NASA+, NASA Television, the NASA app, YouTube, and the agency's website.\n\n5:50 p.m. - NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy, Associate Administrator Jim Free, Associate Administrator for Space Operations Ken Bowersox, and Johnson Space Center Director Vanessa Wyche will speak with Wilmore and Williams about their launch aboard the Starliner spacecraft.\n\n8:50 a.m. - NASA astronauts Wilmore and Williams will provide a tour of Starliner.\n\n11 a.m. - Williams will speak to students from Sunita L. Williams Elementary School in Needham, Massachusetts, in an event aboard the space station.\n\n3:15 p.m. - Wilmore will speak to students from Tennessee Tech University in an event aboard the space station.\n\nWilmore is the commander for the mission. A veteran of two spaceflights, Wilmore has 178 days in space under his belt. In 2009, he served as a pilot aboard space shuttle Atlantis for the STS-129 mission. Additionally, Wilmore served as a flight engineer for Expedition 41 until November 2014, when he assumed command of the space station after arrival of the Expedition 42 crew. He returned to Earth the following March. Prior to his selection by NASA in 2000, the father of two obtained both his bachelor's degree and master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Tennessee Technological University, Cookeville, before graduating with another master's degree in Aviation Systems from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. He is also a graduate of the United States Naval Test Pilot School, Patuxent River, Maryland, and has completed four operational deployments during his tenure as a fleet naval officer and aviator.\n\nWilliams is the spacecraft pilot for the flight test. Williams has spent 322 days in space across two missions: Expedition 14/15 in 2006 through 2007, and Expedition 32/33 in 2012. The Massachusetts native also conducted seven spacewalks, totaling 50 hours and 40 minutes. Before her career began with NASA in 1998, Williams graduated with her bachelor's degree in Physical Science from the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, before obtaining her master's degree in Engineering Management from the Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne. In total, she has logged more than 3,000 flight hours in over 30 different aircraft.\n\nNASA's Commercial Crew Program has delivered on its goal of safe, reliable, and cost-effective transportation to and from the International Space Station from the United States through a partnership with American private industry. This partnership is changing the arc of human spaceflight history by opening access to low Earth orbit and the space station to more people, science, and commercial opportunities.

This is the first time that a ULA rocket has carried a crew to space\n\nButch Wilmore and Suni Williams will be transported to International Space Station (ISS) and spend about a week there before heading home\n\n'Boeing Crew Flight Test' - a long-awaited milestone - is the first launch of Starliner that contains astronauts\n\nRead More Boeing to launch rocket - despite warning from NASA contractor\n\nHowever, mission control responded that they were 'still getting the story together.'\n\nNASA has since determined that the crew is safe and the astronauts continued to sleep as scheduled.\n\nBoeing aerospace engineer Brandon Burroughs said on the NASA broadcast: 'We have a lot of smart people down here on the ground that are going to take a look at this stuff and keep an eye on it, but the vehicle is in a configuration right now where they're safe to fly.'\n\nIt is not clear whether these leaks will lead to any serious issues but it appears that Starliner is still on track to dock with the ISS later on Thursday.\n\nThe launch comes more than a decade since Boeing was first awarded the $4.2 billion contract to develop the Starliner capsule and seven years since its intended launch.\n\nAboard the shuttle were veteran NASA astronauts Suni Williams (left) and commander Butch Wilmore (right)\n\nThis is the third time in a month that the two astronauts have attempted to launch aboard the Starliner, with two earlier attempts called off shortly before takeoff\n\nBoeing's Starliner launches\n\nDecember 2019 First uncrewed flight.

Successfully docked with ISS\n\nJune 2024 First crewed flight to ISS\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn attempt on May 6 was called off just two hours before launch due to an audible 'buzzing' caused by valve issues.\n\nAnother launch attempt last Saturday was halted with less than four minutes to go due to a technical glitch with a launchpad computer.\n\nIf the craft safely returns to Earth, this will mark a significant step forward for Boeing's ambition in the commercial space sector and put pressure on rival SpaceX.\n\nThe launch's success will also come as relief for NASA who are increasingly relying on commercial providers for travel into space.\n\nAfter NASA's Space Shuttle Atlantis was retired in 2011, the American space agency was forced to pay around $80m (\u00a364m) for a seat in a Russian Soyuz capsule to reach the ISS.\n\nBut after 13 years, NASA's Commercial Crew Program (CCP) could finally have two different options to send astronauts to the ISS.\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson told a post-launch press conference that this was another milestone in this extraordinary history of NASA'.\n\nMr Nelson added: 'With Dragon and Starliner, the US is going to have two unique human space transportation systems. We always like to have a backup that makes it safer for our astronauts.'\n\nA helium leak had been detected on the ground before launch but it was deemed that the mission was still safe to go ahead\n\nThe Starliner can carry a maximum of seven astronauts and can be re-used up to ten times after being refurbished between launches\n\nRead More America's first black astronaut aged 90 finally goes to space\n\nIn a brief speech moments before takeoff, Wilmore thanked those who had worked to make the mission possible and alluded to the project's tumultuous progress.\n\nHe said: 'We all know that when the going gets tough, and it often does, the tough get going, and Suni and I are honoured to share this dream of spaceflight with each and every one of you.'\n\nNASA has already ordered six more astronaut rotation flights to the space station as part of the CCP.\n\nThe Starliner itself also represents significant advancements in shuttle technology.\n\nUsing a 'weldless' design the CST-100 (which stands for Crew Space Transportation) should reduce the risk of structural failure.\n\nAlthough it will typically transport four passengers the Starliner can take up to seven astronauts and can be reused up to ten times with six months of refurbishment between flights.\n\nMark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing's Commercial Crew Program, says: 'Everyone is focused on giving Suni and Butch a safe, comfortable ride and performing a successful test mission from start to finish.'\n\nFamous for manufacturing commercial airplanes, Boeing has been under heavy scrutiny in recent months after a chunk of fuselage blew out of one of its new 737s.\n\nThe firm has been blocked from increasing production of the plane as it addresses ongoing safety issues.\n\nIt seems some experts were concerned about Starliner too, as one NASA contractor has warned the mission could be 'catastrophic' on the basis that the craft has sprung a leak.\n\nEXPLAINED: THE $100 BILLION INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION SITS 250 MILES ABOVE THE EARTH\n\nThe International Space Station (ISS) is a $100 billion (\u00a380 billion) science and engineering laboratory that orbits 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.\n\nIt has been permanently staffed by rotating crews of astronauts and cosmonauts since November 2000.\n\nCrews have come mainly from the US and Russia, but the Japanese space agency JAXA and European space agency ESA have also sent astronauts.\n\nThe International Space Station has been continuously occupied for more than 20 years and has been expended with multiple new modules added and upgrades to systems\n\nResearch conducted aboard the ISS often requires one or more of the unusual conditions present in low Earth orbit, such as low-gravity or oxygen.\n\nISS studies have investigated human research, space medicine, life sciences, physical sciences, astronomy and meteorology.\n\nThe US space agency, NASA, spends about $3 billion (\u00a32.4 billion) a year on the space station program, with the remaining funding coming from international partners, including Europe, Russia and Japan.\n\nSo far 244 individuals from 19 countries have visited the station, and among them eight private citizens who spent up to $50 million for their visit.\n\nThere is an ongoing debate about the future of the station beyond 2025, when it is thought some of the original structure will reach 'end of life'.\n\nRussia, a major partner in the station, plans to launch its own orbital platform around then, with Axiom Space, a private firm, planning to send its own modules for purely commercial use to the station at the same time.\n\nNASA, ESA, JAXA and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) are working together to build a space station in orbit around the moon, and Russia and China are working on a similar project, that would also include a base on the surface.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The mission, a key test flight for NASA, aims to demonstrate the spacecraft's capabilities amidst competition with SpaceX. The crew is set to stay on the ISS for eight days before returning.\n\nBoeing's new Starliner capsule and its inaugural two-member NASA crew neared final approach to the International Space Station for docking on Thursday, a key test in proving the vessel's flight-worthiness and sharpening Boeing's competition with Elon Musk's SpaceX. The spacecraft, roughly 200 meters (220 yards) away from the space station, missed an initial time window for docking with the orbital laboratory as mission managers in Houston investigated the failure of some spacecraft thrusters used for precise maneuvering.\n\nStarliner will conduct some thruster tests before its next attempt to approach the space station in a window that opens at 1:33 p.m. EDT (1733 GMT). The CST-100 Starliner, with veteran astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams aboard, was due to arrive at the orbiting platform after a flight of roughly 25 hours following its launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\n\nThe reusable gumdrop-shaped capsule, dubbed \"Calypso\" by its crew, was lofted into space on Wednesday atop an Atlas V rocket furnished and flown by Boeing-Lockheed Martin's United Launch Alliance joint venture. It had originally been scheduled to autonomously dock with the ISS while both are orbiting some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth at approximately 12:15 p.m. ET (1615 GMT).\n\nThe spacecraft's approach to the ISS was being livestreamed on a NASA webcast, which showed video images of the capsule captured by a camera aboard the space station. Once securely coupled to the space laboratory, Wilmore and Williams would conduct a series of standard procedures, such as checking for airlock leaks and pressurizing the passage between the capsule and the ISS, before opening the entry hatches.\n\nThey would be welcomed aboard by the outpost's current seven resident crew members: four fellow U.S. astronauts and three Russian cosmonauts. Plans call for Wilmore and Williams to remain aboard the station for about eight days, then depart on a return flight that will take Starliner on a fiery reentry back through Earth's atmosphere and end with a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the U.S. Desert Southwest, a first for a crewed NASA mission.\n\nOn its voyage to the ISS, helium leaks were detected on Starliner's propulsion system, knocking out some of the 28 thrusters used by the capsule to maneuver in space. The astronauts remain safe, and the spacecraft has backup thrusters to compensate for the loss, according to NASA and Boeing. Starliner uses helium to add pressure to the propellant for its thrusters. NASA and Boeing did not specify the positions of the downed thrusters or how quickly helium was leaking.\n\nNASA mission managers early on Thursday morning gave Boeing the green light to proceed to rendezvous. YEARS OF TECHNICAL PROBLEMS\n\nThe Starliner launch on Wednesday followed years of technical problems, various delays and a first successful 2022 test mission to the orbital laboratory without astronauts aboard. Last-minute glitches had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts, including a helium leak found on the capsule's propulsion system that officials later determined was not serious enough to warrant a mechanical fix.\n\nNASA and Boeing officials at the time pointed to a faulty seal on one thruster component that was failing to keep the helium inside. Boeing built Starliner under contract with NASA to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been the U.S. space agency's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from American soil. The current mission marks Starliner's first test flight with astronauts aboard, a requirement before NASA can certify the capsule for routine astronaut missions.\n\nSelected as crew for the pivotal flight were two NASA veterans who have previously logged 500 days in space between them: Wilmore, 61, a retired Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft. Getting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its $4.2 billion, fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of two different U.S. rides to the ISS.\n\nThe Starliner is several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget. Meanwhile, Boeing's commercial airplane manufacturing operations have been rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is

On its own, the spacecraft fired onboard thrusters to push itself into orbit, kicking off its 24-hour catch-up journey with the ISS, which orbits some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.\n\nBoeing intends for Starliner - seeded with NASA funding - to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been the U.S. space agency's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from US soil.\n\n\"This is another milestone in this extraordinary history of NASA,\" the agency's administrator Bill Nelson told a press conference.\n\nThe mission is a test flight required before NASA can certify Starliner for routine astronaut missions. Now in space, the capsule will need to execute precise maneuvers to dock with the ISS on Thursday, demonstrate it can stay docked for about eight days, then safely return the two astronauts to Earth, among other flight objectives.\n\nMark Nappi, Boeing's Starliner program chief, told reporters that tens of thousands of things have to go right during Starliner's launch, and that on Wednesday \"it all lined up.\"\n\n\"We had just a perfect countdown and launch. ... It's been a long time coming. And we're really, really proud,\" Nappi said.\n\nBoeing shares closed up 0.7 per cent.\n\nLast-minute issues had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a launchpad computer glitch.\n\nThe seven-seat Starliner's inaugural crew includes two veteran NASA astronauts in Wilmore, 61, a retired US Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nThey have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each. Wilmore is the designated commander, with Williams in the pilot seat.\n\nSpace ambitions\n\nBoeing, with its commercial airplane operations rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners, needs a win in space for its Starliner venture, already several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget. Getting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of two different U.S. rides to the ISS.\n\nThe longtime NASA contractor has built modules for the decades-old ISS and rockets designed to loft astronauts toward the moon. But Boeing never before built its own operational spacecraft, a feat complicated by years of software issues, technical glitches and management shakeups on the Starliner program.\n\nSpaceX's Crew Dragon has become a dependable taxi to orbit for NASA. That capsule and Starliner are among the first in a new generation of privately built spacecraft designed to fly astronauts to low-Earth orbit, and later to the moon under NASA's Artemis program.\n\nStarliner, which like Crew Dragon is reusable, would compete head-to-head with the SpaceX capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from US soil.\n\n\"Congratulations on a successful launch,\" Musk wrote on social media.\n\nBoeing intends to build two Starliner capsules that can carry out NASA astronaut missions, and possibly more for private spaceflight missions, depending on commercial demand, Nappi said.\n\nThat demand is driven by government space agencies and early plans from other companies, such as Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, to build privately run space stations whose development NASA is funding to replace the aging ISS in 2030. Crew Dragon has flown nine NASA astronaut missions to the ISS and four private customer missions.\n\nWilmore and Williams are due to join ISS's current seven resident crew members before riding Starliner back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the U.S. Desert Southwest - a first for a crewed NASA mission.", "source": {"uri": "gulfbusiness.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gulf Business"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@gulfbusiness.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space rendezvous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water vapor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blue Origin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Bezos"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://gulfbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2155602525.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 2447, "textEnd": 2452}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

The flight also marks Sunita's third foray into space.\n\nStarliner's success will determine if the spacecraft will be certified to fly six-month astronaut missions to and from the ISS for NASA, something which Elon Musk's SpaceX already does.\n\nAfter a safe arrival at the space station, Wilmore and Williams will join the Expedition 71 crew of NASA astronauts Michael Barratt, Matt Dominick, Tracy C. Dyson, and Jeanette Epps, and Roscosmos cosmonauts Nikolai Chub, Alexander Grebenkin, and Oleg Kononenko.\n\n\"Two bold NASA astronauts are well on their way on this historic first test flight of a brand-new spacecraft,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson after the Starliner launch.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk congratulated Boeing on the successful launch of its Starliner craft to space.\n\n\"Congratulations on a successful launch!\" SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk said via X today. He also retweeted the US space agency's tweet that read \"Starliner to the stars!\"\n\nDuring a 2013 press conference at the National Science Centre in New Delhi, Sunita told reporters that during her space missions she carries with her the Bhagavad Gita and samosas.\n\nBoth Suni and Butch will remain in the ISS for about a week before undocking from the ISS re-enter Earth's atmosphere. It will make a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the southwestern United States on June 10, NASA said.\n\nAfter the successful lift off on Wednesday night, NASA chief Bill Nelson said in a post launch press conference termed it as a \"special moment.\" \"It's another one of those great markers in history,\" he said.\n\n\"Today's launch is a milestone achievement for the future of spaceflight,\" Nelson posted on X adding, \"Butch and Suni--safe travels through the stars. See you back home.\n\n\"Both Boing and SpaceX received funding from NASA's Commercial Crew program in 2014 to carry astronauts to the ISS after the US space agency retired its Space Shuttle Program in 2011.Boeing received over USD 4 billion in US federal funds to develop the Starliner, while SpaceX received about USD 2.6 billion.\n\nSpaceX company's Crew Dragon has performed 12 crewed missions to the ISS since its first launch on May 30, 2020.Before Wednesday's launch the last attempt to launch Boeing's Starliner spacecraft was scrubbed on Saturday less than four minutes before blastoff from the Kennedy Space Centre due to a ground system computer triggering an automatic abort command that shut down the launch sequence.\n\nOn May 6, NASA, Boeing and ULA \"scrubbed\" the launch due to a \"suspect oxygen relief valve on the Atlas V rocket's Centaur second stage\n\n\"Sunita, from Needham, Massachusetts, earned a physical science degree from the US Naval Academy, and a master's in engineering management from the Florida Institute of Technology.\n\nHer first spaceflight was Expedition 14/15 (from December 2006 to June 2007) launching on space shuttle Discovery's STS-116 mission to reach the International Station, according to NASA.\n\nWhile onboard, Sunita established a world record for women at the time with four spacewalks. She concluded her tour of duty by returning to Earth with shuttle Atlantis' STS-117 flight to land at Edwards Air Force Base in California on June 22, 2007.Selected as an astronaut by NASA in June 1998, Sunita has spent a total of 322 days in space on two missions and accumulated 50 hours and 40 minutes of cumulative EVA time on seven spacewalks.\n\nShe worked with Roscosmos on its contribution to the space station and with the first Expedition crew.\n\nMeanwhile, 61-year-old, Barry Wilmore has logged 178 days in space and has 25 hours and 36 minutes of time on four spacewalks.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on June 6, 2024", "source": {"uri": "thehindubusinessline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "@businessline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_E._Wilmore", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barry E.

The current mission marks Starliner's first test flight with astronauts aboard, a requirement before NASA can certify the capsule for routine astronaut missions.\n\nSelected as crew for the pivotal flight were two NASA veterans who have previously logged 500 days in space between them - Wilmore, 61, a retired U.S. Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of two different U.S. rides to the ISS. The Starliner is several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget. Meanwhile, Boeing's commercial airplane manufacturing operations have been rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners.\n\n(Reporting by Joey Roulette in Washington and Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Will Dunham)", "source": {"uri": "zawya.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zawya.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airlock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airlock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propellant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Propellant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(United_States_O-6)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (United States O-6)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 65}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The current mission marks Starliner's first test flight with astronauts aboard, a requirement before NASA can certify the capsule for routine astronaut missions.\n\nSelected as crew for the pivotal flight were two NASA veterans who have previously logged 500 days in space between them - Wilmore, 61, a retired U.S. Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of two different U.S. rides to the ISS. The Starliner is several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget. Meanwhile, Boeing's commercial airplane manufacturing operations have been rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners.\n\n(Reporting by Joey Roulette in Washington and Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Will Dunham)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The flight also marks Sunita's third foray into space.\n\nIndian-American astronout Sunita 'Suni' Williams- piloted spacecraft carrying fellow NASA astronaut Barry' Butch' Williams was launched on Wednesday toward the International Space Station (ISS) from the Cape Canaveral Space Station in Florida in a test flight that was hit with multiple delays. \"Let's go, Calypso,\" was the message Sunita radioed to mission control minutes before liftoff, referring to the name of the Starliner capsule. \"Take us to space and back.\"\n\nStarliner is scheduled to reach the ISS today at around 9.45 pm Indian Standard Time (around 12:15 pm ET). Sunita's mother, Bonnie Pandya, told NBC News hours before liftoff that her daughter was in good spirits and was \"so happy about going.\"\n\nNASA said in an update on Thursday morning said that both Sunita and Butch Wilmore are hard at work performing initial tests on the Starliner spacecraft in orbit, \"The first six hours have been absolutely fascinating,\" Butch who took manual control of the spacecraft told the mission centre at NASA's centre in Houston.\n\nNASA said that at 10:52 am ET, Boeing's Starliner lifted off on a ULA Launch Atlas V rocket for the first time and the mission dubbed as the Crew Flight Test aims to certify the spacecraft for routine space travel to and from the International Space Station. Sunita Williams, 58, has scripted history by becoming the first female astronaut to fly on the first flight of a crewed spacecraft. The flight also marks Sunita's third foray into space.\n\nStarliner's success will determine if the spacecraft will be certified to fly six-month astronaut missions to and from the ISS for NASA, something which Elon Musk's SpaceX already does. After a safe arrival at the space station, Wilmore and Williams will join the Expedition 71 crew of NASA astronauts Michael Barratt, Matt Dominick, Tracy C. Dyson, and Jeanette Epps, and Roscosmos cosmonauts Nikolai Chub, Alexander Grebenkin, and Oleg Kononenko.\n\n\"Two bold NASA astronauts are well on their way on this historic first test flight of a brand-new spacecraft,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson after the Starliner launch. Meanwhile, SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk congratulated Boeing on the successful launch of its Starliner craft to space.\n\n\"Congratulations on a successful launch!\" SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk said via X today. He also retweeted the US space agency's tweet that read \"Starliner to the stars!\" During a 2013 press conference at the National Science Centre in New Delhi, Sunita told reporters that during her space missions she carries with her the Bhagavad Gita and samosas.\n\nBoth Suni and Butch will remain in the ISS for about a week before undocking from the ISS re-enter Earth's atmosphere. It will make a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the southwestern United States on June 10, NASA said. After the successful lift off on Wednesday night, NASA chief Bill Nelson said in a post launch press conference termed it as a \"special moment.\" \"It's another one of those great markers in history,\" he said.\n\n\"Today's launch is a milestone achievement for the future of spaceflight,\" Nelson posted on X adding, \"Butch and Suni--safe travels through the stars. See you back home.\" Both Boing and SpaceX received funding from NASA's Commercial Crew program in 2014 to carry astronauts to the ISS after the US space agency retired its Space Shuttle Program in 2011.\n\nBoeing received over USD 4 billion in US federal funds to develop the Starliner, while SpaceX received about USD 2.6 billion. SpaceX company's Crew Dragon has performed 12 crewed missions to the ISS since its first launch on May 30, 2020.\n\nBefore Wednesday's launch the last attempt to launch Boeing's Starliner spacecraft was scrubbed on Saturday less than four minutes before blastoff from the Kennedy Space Centre due to a ground system computer triggering an automatic abort command that shut down the launch sequence. On May 6, NASA, Boeing and ULA \"scrubbed\" the launch due to a \"suspect oxygen relief valve on the Atlas V rocket's Centaur second stage\"\n\nSunita, from Needham, Massachusetts, earned a physical science degree from the US Naval Academy, and a master's in engineering management from the Florida Institute of Technology.Her first spaceflight was Expedition 14/15 (from December 2006 to June 2007) launching on space shuttle Discovery's STS-116 mission to reach the International Station, according to NASA. While onboard, Sunita established a world record for women at the time with four spacewalks. She concluded her tour of duty by returning to Earth with shuttle Atlantis' STS-117 flight to land at Edwards Air Force Base in California on June 22, 2007.\n\nSelected as an astronaut by NASA in June 1998, Sunita has spent a total of 322 days in space on two missions and accumulated 50 hours and 40 minutes of cumulative EVA time on seven spacewalks. She worked with Roscosmos on its contribution to the space station and with the first Expedition crew.\n\nMeanwhile, 61-year-old, Barry Wilmore has logged 178 days in space and has 25 hours and 36 minutes of time on four spacewalks.

AP-Yonhap\n\nBoeing launched astronauts for the first time Wednesday, belatedly joining SpaceX as a second taxi service for NASA.\n\nA pair of NASA test pilots blasted off aboard Boeing's Starliner capsule for the International Space Station, the first to fly the new spacecraft.\n\nThe trip by Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams was expected to take 25 hours, with an arrival Thursday. They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\n\"Let's get going!\" Wilmore called out a few minutes before liftoff.\n\nHalf an hour later, he and Williams were safely in orbit and giving chase to the space station. Back at Cape Canaveral, the relieved launch controllers stood and applauded. After all the trouble leading up to Wednesday's launch, including two scrapped countdowns, everything went smoothly before and during liftoff, prompting congratulations from SpaceX's Elon Musk and others.\n\n\"Today it all lined up,\" said Boeing program manager Mark Nappi.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nWilmore and Williams -- retired Navy captains and former space station residents -- stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing's ability to get it right with this test flight. Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but remained extremely low and manageable.\n\n\"It's just a tough endeavor to get to flight and huge kudos to the entire team for getting there,\" said Steve Stich, NASA's commercial crew program manager.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries -- Russia, the U.S. and China -- had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nMembers of the NASA Boeing Crew Flight Test Butch Wilmore, left, and Suni Williams, right, both of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), walk out of the Neil A. Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building to the Space Launch Complex-41 in Titusville, Florida, June 5. EPA-Yonhap\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems. The only snag early in the flight involved the capsule's cooling system. More water was used than expected before the radiators took over in orbit. The tank will be refilled before the ride home.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"This is exciting. We built up to this moment for years and years, and it finally happened,\" Fincke said from neighboring Kennedy Space Center. \"I feel like the whole planet was cheering for them.\" (AP)", "source":

The mission represents a significant milestone for Boeing, demonstrating competition with SpaceX's Crew Dragon and validating Starliner's flight-worthiness for future astronaut missions.\n\nBoeing's new Starliner capsule and an inaugural two-member NASA crew safely docked with the International Space Station on Thursday, meeting a key test in proving the vessel's flight-worthiness and sharpening Boeing's competition with Elon Musk's SpaceX. The rendezvous was achieved despite an earlier loss of several guidance-control jet thrusters, some of them due to a helium propulsion leak, which NASA and Boeing said should not compromise the mission.\n\nThe CST-100 Starliner, with veteran astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams aboard, arrived at the orbiting platform after a flight of nearly 27 hours following its launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The reusable, gumdrop-shaped capsule, dubbed \"Calypso\" by its crew, was lofted into space on Wednesday atop an Atlas V rocket furnished and flown by Boeing-Lockheed Martin's United Launch Alliance joint venture.\n\nIt autonomously docked with the ISS while both were orbiting some 250 miles (400 km) over the southern Indian Ocean at 1:34 p.m. EDT (1734 GMT), as the two vehicles soared around the globe in tandem at about 17,500 miles (28,160 km) per hour. The spacecraft's final approach to the ISS and docking, following a brief interval when Wilmore manually controlled the capsule, was shown on a NASA webcast.\n\n\"Nice to be attached to the big city in the sky,\" Wilmore radioed to mission control in Houston shortly after docking. Once securely coupled to the space laboratory with a series of 12 hooks, Wilmore and Williams must conduct a series of standard procedures, such as checking for airlock leaks and pressurizing the passage between the capsule and the ISS, before opening the entry hatches.\n\nThey were to be welcomed aboard by the outpost's current seven resident crew members: four fellow U.S. astronauts and three Russian cosmonauts. Plans call for Wilmore and Williams to remain aboard the station for about eight days, then depart on a return flight that will take Starliner on a fiery reentry back through Earth's atmosphere and end with a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the U.S. Desert Southwest, a first for a crewed NASA mission.\n\nOn its voyage to the ISS, helium leaks were detected on Starliner's propulsion system, knocking out some of the 28 thrusters used by the capsule to make precision maneuvers in space. However, the spacecraft still had enough functioning thrusters to compensate for the loss, according to NASA and Boeing. An additional thruster was disabled by mission control just before final approach. YEARS OF TECHNICAL PROBLEMS\n\nThe Starliner launch on Wednesday followed years of technical problems, various delays and a first successful 2022 test mission to the orbital laboratory without astronauts aboard. Last-minute glitches had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts, including a helium leak found on the capsule's propulsion system that officials later determined was not serious enough to warrant a mechanical fix.\n\nNASA and Boeing officials at the time pointed to a faulty seal on one thruster component that was failing to keep the helium inside. Boeing built Starliner under contract with NASA to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been the U.S. space agency's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from American soil. The current mission marks Starliner's first test flight with astronauts aboard, a requirement before NASA can certify the capsule for routine astronaut missions.\n\nSelected as crew for the pivotal flight were two NASA veterans who have previously logged 500 days in space between them: Wilmore, 61, a retired Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft. Getting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its $4.2 billion, fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of two different U.S. rides to the ISS.\n\nThe Starliner is several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget. Meanwhile, Boeing's commercial airplane manufacturing operations have been rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(fruit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Capsule (fruit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_E._Wilmore", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barry E.

The flight also marks Sunita's third foray into space.\n\nStarliner's success will determine if the spacecraft will be certified to fly six-month astronaut missions to and from the ISS for NASA, something which Elon Musk's SpaceX already does.\n\nAfter a safe arrival at the space station, Wilmore and Williams will join the Expedition 71 crew of NASA astronauts Michael Barratt, Matt Dominick, Tracy C. Dyson, and Jeanette Epps, and Roscosmos cosmonauts Nikolai Chub, Alexander Grebenkin, and Oleg Kononenko.\n\n\"Two bold NASA astronauts are well on their way on this historic first test flight of a brand-new spacecraft,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson after the Starliner launch.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk congratulated Boeing on the successful launch of its Starliner craft to space.\n\n\"Congratulations on a successful launch!\" SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk said via X today. He also retweeted the US space agency's tweet that read \"Starliner to the stars!\"\n\nDuring a 2013 press conference at the National Science Centre in New Delhi, Sunita told reporters that during her space missions she carries with her the Bhagavad Gita and samosas.\n\nBoth Suni and Butch will remain in the ISS for about a week before undocking from the ISS re-enter Earth's atmosphere. It will make a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the southwestern United States on June 10, NASA said.\n\nAfter the successful lift off on Wednesday night, NASA chief Bill Nelson said in a post launch press conference termed it as a \"special moment.\" \"It's another one of those great markers in history,\" he said.\n\n\"Today's launch is a milestone achievement for the future of spaceflight,\" Nelson posted on X adding, \"Butch and Suni--safe travels through the stars. See you back home.\"\n\nBoth Boing and SpaceX received funding from NASA's Commercial Crew program in 2014 to carry astronauts to the ISS after the US space agency retired its Space Shuttle Program in 2011.\n\nBoeing received over USD 4 billion in US federal funds to develop the Starliner, while SpaceX received about USD 2.6 billion.\n\nSpaceX company's Crew Dragon has performed 12 crewed missions to the ISS since its first launch on May 30, 2020.\n\nBefore Wednesday's launch the last attempt to launch Boeing's Starliner spacecraft was scrubbed on Saturday less than four minutes before blastoff from the Kennedy Space Centre due to a ground system computer triggering an automatic abort command that shut down the launch sequence.\n\nOn May 6, NASA, Boeing and ULA \"scrubbed\" the launch due to a \"suspect oxygen relief valve on the Atlas V rocket's Centaur second stage\"\n\nSunita, from Needham, Massachusetts, earned a physical science degree from the US Naval Academy, and a master's in engineering management from the Florida Institute of Technology.\n\nHer first spaceflight was Expedition 14/15 (from December 2006 to June 2007) launching on space shuttle Discovery's STS-116 mission to reach the International Station, according to NASA.\n\nWhile onboard, Sunita established a world record for women at the time with four spacewalks. She concluded her tour of duty by returning to Earth with shuttle Atlantis' STS-117 flight to land at Edwards Air Force Base in California on June 22, 2007.\n\nSelected as an astronaut by NASA in June 1998, Sunita has spent a total of 322 days in space on two missions and accumulated 50 hours and 40 minutes of cumulative EVA time on seven spacewalks.\n\nShe worked with Roscosmos on its contribution to the space station and with the first Expedition crew.\n\nMeanwhile, 61-year-old, Barry Wilmore has logged 178 days in space and has 25 hours and 36 minutes of time on four spacewalks.

We look forward to getting the astronauts safely to the space station and back home,\" Colbert said in a press release.\n\nWilmore and Williams are also the first to be launched on an Atlas V rocket and are currently experiencing microgravity on their way to the space station. They will conduct a series of flight test objectives, including manually flying Starliner.\n\nAlong with the two crew members, Starliner is carrying about 760 pounds (345 kilogrammes) of cargo.\n\nOnce docked to the ISS, Wilmore and Williams will spend about a week on station before returning to Earth. Following a successful CFT, Boeing and NASA will continue working to certify Starliner for long-duration operational missions to the ISS.\n\nWilliams also made history as the first woman to embark on such a mission. And it won't be her first entry in the history books.\n\nIn 2012, during a prior trip to the International Space Station, Williams became the first person to finish a triathlon in space, during which she simulated swimming using a weight-lifting machine and ran on a treadmill while strapped in by a harness so she wouldn't float away.\n\nThat came after she ran the Boston Marathon from the space station in 2007.\n\nWilliams received her commission as an Ensign in the United States Navy from the United States Naval Academy in May 1987. Williams was selected as an astronaut by NASA in 1998 and is a veteran of two space missions, Expeditions 14/15 in 2006 and 32/33 and 2012.\n\nShe served as a flight engineer on Expedition 32 and then commander of Expedition 33.\n\nBoeing's Crew Flight Test mission has been delayed for several years because of setbacks in the spacecraft's development.\n\nLast-minute computer trouble nixed Saturday's launch attempt for Boeing's first astronaut flight, the latest in a string of delays over the years.\n\nIt was the second launch attempt. The first try on May 6 was delayed for leak checks and rocket repairs\n\nWith the launch, Boeing became the second private firm able to provide crew transport to and from the ISS, alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX.", "source": {"uri": "orissapost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Odisha News, Odisha Latest news, Odisha Daily -

The astronauts remain safe, and the spacecraft has backup thrusters to compensate for the loss, according to NASA and Boeing.\n\nStarliner uses helium to add pressure to the propellant for its thrusters. NASA and Boeing did not specify the positions of the downed thrusters or how quickly helium was leaking.\n\nNASA mission managers early on Thursday morning gave Boeing the green light to proceed to rendezvous.\n\nThe Starliner launch on Wednesday followed years of technical problems, various delays and a first successful 2022 test mission to the orbital laboratory without astronauts aboard.\n\nLast-minute glitches had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts, including a helium leak found on the capsule's propulsion system that officials later determined was not serious enough to warrant a mechanical fix.\n\nNASA and Boeing officials at the time pointed to a faulty seal on one thruster component that was failing to keep the helium inside.\n\nBoeing built Starliner under contract with NASA to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been the U.S. space agency's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from American soil. The current mission marks Starliner's first test flight with astronauts aboard, a requirement before NASA can certify the capsule for routine astronaut missions.\n\nSelected as crew for the pivotal flight were two NASA veterans who have previously logged 500 days in space between them: Wilmore, 61, a retired Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its $4.2 billion, fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of two different U.S. rides to the ISS.\n\nThe Starliner is several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget. Meanwhile, Boeing's commercial airplane manufacturing operations have been rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space rendezvous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airlock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airlock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere of Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(United_States_O-6)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (United States O-6)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/XSRVDB4GJBHC5EMFP5P53I5XWQ.JPG?auth=f6d968fdb2158bf66964287b3023c4f25c13017b885b80421aaf971939847f07&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

It began May 6, the original launch date, when trouble with a valve in the rocket's upper stage forced the mission to be scrubbed.\n\nThe team was able to replace the valve and re-pressurize the system, but then engineers encountered another obstacle: a small helium leak in Starliner's service module. That issue caused additional delays until it finally lifted off Wednesday.\n\nNow, NASA veterans Wilmore and Williams have at long last reached their destination. NASA, which provided live coverage of Wednesday's launch, aired coverage of the landing as well.\n\nThe Starliner spacecraft was perched atop the Atlas V rocket manufactured by the United Launch Alliance when it launched at 10:52 a.m. ET Wednesday from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nThe capsule successfully broke away from the rocket after reaching orbit and began firing its own engines as it powered onward to the International Space Station, NASA said.\n\nNASA shared an update late Wednesday night saying three helium leaks had been discovered on the spacecraft. The team was aware of one before launch, but the additional leaks occurred after Starliner arrived in orbit.\n\n\"Two of the affected helium valves have been closed and the spacecraft remains stable,\" the organization said.\n\nStarliner docked autonomously Thursday afternoon around 1:34 p.m. ET on the forward-facing port of the International Space Station's Harmony module. Wilmore and Williams, both former Navy pilots, will spend about a week testing the Starliner spacecraft and its subsystems before they board the capsule for a return trip to Earth.\n\nThe craft will land in the American Southwest using parachutes that will slow it down to 4 mph before inflating large airbags.\n\nThe Starliner was designed to accommodate no more than seven passengers for missions to low-Earth orbit.\n\nFor NASA, the capsule is intended to carry four astronauts along with a mix of cargo and other scientific instruments to and from the International Space Station. Williams, 58, and Wilmore, 61, were selected for the inaugural crewed flight of the Starliner, which completed two previous flight tests with no one aboard.\n\nBoeing hopes to join Elon Musk's SpaceX as one of two companies contracted by NASA for routine missions to the space station and low-Earth orbit.\n\nAs part of NASA's commercial crew program, Boeing was awarded $4.8 billion and SpaceX was awarded $3.1 billion in 2014 to develop their respective spacecraft, Florida Today reported.\n\nSpaceX, whose Dragon spacecraft flew its first human mission in 2020, recently saw its Crew-7 return to Earth after nearly 200 days aboard the International Space Station. The eighth crew comprised of three NASA astronauts and one cosmonaut launched on March 3 and docked on March 5 to await the arrival of Boeing's Starliner capsule.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

The launch was part of NASA's long-delayed Boeing Crew Flight Test, during which the astronauts lifted off at 10:52 a.m. EDT on Wednesday on a ULA (United Launch Alliance) Atlas V rocket from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida on an end-to-end test of the Starliner system. \"Two bold NASA astronauts are well on their way on this historic first test flight of a brand-new spacecraft,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \"Boeing's Starliner marks a new chapter of American exploration. Human spaceflight is a daring task - but that's why it's worth doing. It's an exciting time for NASA, our commercial partners, and the future of exploration. Go Starliner, Go Butch and Suni!\" The flight test will help validate the transportation system, launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, in-orbit operations capabilities, and return to Earth with astronauts aboard as the agency prepares to certify Starliner for rotational missions to the space station. Starliner previously flew two uncrewed orbital flights, including a test to and from the space station, along with a pad abort demonstration. \"With Starliner's launch, separation from the rocket, and arrival on orbit, Boeing's Crew Flight Test is right on track,\" said Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing's Commercial Crew Program. \"Everyone is focused on giving Suni and Butch a safe, comfortable, ride and performing a successful test mission from start to finish.\" During Starliner's flight, Boeing will monitor a series of automatic spacecraft manoeuvres from its mission control center in Houston. NASA teams will monitor space station operations throughout the flight from the Mission Control Center at the agency's Johnson Space Center in Houston. \"Flying crew on Starliner represents over a decade of work by the Commercial Crew Program and our partners at Boeing and ULA,\" said Steve Stich, manager, Commercial Crew Program, at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. \"For many of us, this is a career-defining moment bringing on a new crew transportation capability for our agency and our nation. We are going to take it one step at a time, putting Starliner through its paces, and remaining vigilant until Butch and Suni safely touch down back on Earth at the conclusion of this test flight.\" Starliner will autonomously dock to the forward-facing port of the station's Harmony module at approximately 12:15 p.m. Thursday, June 6, and remain at the orbital laboratory for about a week. Wilmore and Williams will help verify the spacecraft is performing as intended by testing the environmental control system, the displays and control system, and by maneuvering the thrusters, among other tests during flight. After a safe arrival at the space station, Wilmore and Williams will join the Expedition 71 crew of NASA astronauts Michael Barratt, Matt Dominick, Tracy C. Dyson, and Jeanette Epps, and Roscosmos cosmonauts Nikolai Chub, Alexander Grebenkin, and Oleg Kononenko.", "source": {"uri": "wataugademocrat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Watauga Democrat"},

The two have spent a combined 500 days in space over two ISS missions each. Both said repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing for this flight after so many delays.\n\nThe launch came two years after Starliner completed its first test flight to the ISS without astronauts on board. Last-minute problems had delayed the Starliner's first two launch attempts with humans.\n\nNASA halted a planned May 6 launch two hours before liftoff because of a problem with a rocket. Another attempt last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a problem with a launchpad computer.\n\n\"I know it's been a long road to get here,\" NASA's commercial crew program leader Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.\n\nBoeing and SpaceX are both paid to carry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies after ending the space shuttle program.\n\nIn 2020, SpaceX became the first private business to launch astronauts into orbit. Only three countries, Russia, the U.S., and China have launched humans into space using their own systems. Since then, SpaceX has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company.\n\nIf the Starliner mission goes well, NASA will use both SpaceX and Boeing for flights, beginning next year.", "source": {"uri": "learningenglish.voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://gdb.voanews.com/159f6972-6098-4cb2-8cc2-2b20ea8fe0eb_w1200_r1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 946, "textEnd": 953}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1445, "textEnd": 1450}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

They're test pilots, and they're going to test this thing from izard to gizzard,\" said NASA administrator Bill Nelson during a news conference a few hours after the launch.\n\nThe two were expected to reach the orbiting laboratory at 12:15 p.m. EDT on Thursday after a 25-and-a-half-hour journey. NASA's Johnson Space Center posted on X that the crew continued the mission despite the reported leaks and were in a \"sleep period\" just after 11 p.m.\n\nNASA said one of the three leaks was known and discussed before the flight, along with a management plan, while the other two occurred after the spacecraft entered orbit around Earth.\n\n\"Two of the affected helium valves have been closed, and the spacecraft remains stable,\" NASA said.\n\nVeteran NASA astronauts Wilmore and Williams helped build Starliner and waited for years to fly it. The capsule is carrying around 760 pounds of cargo to the ISS, and when it docks, the real work begins.\n\n\"It's easy to get impatient. It's easy to get tired. I was so impressed with the professionalism, the whole team, the way they kept their priorities in the proper order to make sure they were ready to go today.\" Said Ken Bowersox, who's the associate administrator for NASA's Space Operations Mission Directorate.\n\nIt wasn't easy for Boeing, ULA, or NASA to get here. Wednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts onboard since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\nStarliner is 10 years in the making and years behind schedule, costing Boeing more than a billion dollars in losses, according to reports.\n\n\"It's been a long time coming, and we're really, really proud of the team that got us here,\" said Mark Nappi, who manages Boeing's commercial crew space program.\n\nNASA didn't give up on the program because they needed a second vehicle to get astronauts to and from space.\n\nDuring this test flight, Boeing crews will also monitor a helium leak about the size of a softball.\n\n\"That was right where we left it when we had the countdown on June 1, no change in the leak rate at all,\" said Steve Stich, who manages NASA's commercial crew program.\n\nThey found the leak in May and couldn't seal it completely. During the week-long mission, the astronauts will also manually fly the Starliner and test its life support capabilities when docked at the space station.\n\n\"We look forward to an outstanding mission,\" said Joel Montalbano, who's the deputy associate administrator with NASA's Space Operations Mission Directorate.\n\nStarliner and its astronauts will remain at the ISS for about a week before returning to Earth.\n\nAccording to Boeing, this launch will demonstrate the Starliner's launch-to-landing capabilities and \"prove the team's readiness to achieve NASA certification and fly long-duration missions for the agency.\"\n\nWilliams and Wilmore will participate in human research studies on the physiological impacts of space flight and carry some hardware for future studies. Because this is Boeing's Crew Flight Test (CFT), researchers will pay extra attention to how all systems work.\n\nIt will take Wilmore and Williams about 26 hours to reach the ISS, where they will stay for about a week.\n\nPer NASA: \"Williams is the first female astronaut to fly on the first flight of a crewed spacecraft. It also marks the first crewed launch on the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket and the first crewed launch on an Atlas family class rocket since Gordon Cooper on the last Mercury program flight aboard \"Faith 7\" in May 1963.\u202f\"", "source": {"uri": "fox35orlando.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 35 Orlando"}, "authors": [{"uri": "esther_bower@fox35orlando.com", "name": "Esther Bower", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrator_of_NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Administrator of NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Johnson Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Bowersox", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ken Bowersox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_propulsion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft propulsion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geocentric orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Crewed_Flight_Test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Crewed Flight Test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury-Atlas_9", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mercury-Atlas 9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(rocket_family)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlas (rocket family)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mercury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Project Mercury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_support", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Life support"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 44}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox35orlando.com/www.fox35orlando.com/content/uploads/2024/06/1280/720/GettyImages-2155865059.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 2686, "textEnd": 2692}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The mission, dubbed the Crew Flight Test, aims to certify the spacecraft for routine space travel to and from the International Space Station.\n\nSunita Williams, 58, has made history by becoming the first female astronaut to fly on the inaugural flight of a crewed spacecraft. This flight also marks her third journey into space.\n\nStarliner's success will determine if the spacecraft will be certified to fly six-month astronaut missions to and from the ISS for NASA, a service already provided by Elon Musk's SpaceX.\n\nUpon their safe arrival at the space station, Wilmore and Williams will join the Expedition 71 crew, which includes NASA astronauts Michael Barratt, Matt Dominick, Tracy C Dyson, and Jeanette Epps, along with Roscosmos cosmonauts Nikolai Chub, Alexander Grebenkin, and Oleg Kononenko.\n\n\"Two bold NASA astronauts are well on their way on this historic first test flight of a brand-new spacecraft,\" said NASA administrator Bill Nelson after the Starliner launch.\n\nSpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk congratulated Boeing on the successful launch of its Starliner craft to space.\n\n\"Congratulations on a successful launch!\" SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk said via X today. He also reposted the US space agency's post, that read \"Starliner to the stars!\"\n\nDuring a 2013 press conference at the National Science Centre in New Delhi, Sunita told reporters that she carries a copy of the Bhagavad Gita and samosas with her during her space missions.\n\nBoth Suni and Butch will remain at the ISS for about a week before undocking and re-entering Earth's atmosphere. NASA said that the spacecraft will make a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the southwestern United States on June 10.\n\nAfter the successful liftoff on Wednesday night, NASA chief Bill Nelson described the event as a \"special moment\" during a post-launch press conference. \"It's another one of those great markers in history,\" he said.\n\n\"Today's launch is a milestone achievement for the future of spaceflight,\" Nelson posted on X, adding, \"Butch and Suni--safe travels through the stars. See you back home.\"\n\nIn 2014, both Boeing and SpaceX received funding from NASA's Commercial Crew programme to carry astronauts to the ISS after the US space agency retired its Space Shuttle Program in 2011.\n\nBoeing received over USD 4 billion in US federal funds to develop the Starliner, while SpaceX received about USD 2.6 billion.\n\nSince its first launch on May 30, 2020, SpaceX's Crew Dragon has performed 12 crewed missions to the ISS.\n\nBefore Wednesday's launch, the last attempt to launch Boeing's Starliner spacecraft was scrubbed on Saturday, less than four minutes before blastoff from the Kennedy Space Centre, due to a ground system computer triggering an automatic abort command that shut down the launch sequence.\n\nOn May 6, NASA, Boeing, and ULA \"scrubbed\" the launch due to a \"suspect oxygen relief valve on the Atlas V rocket's Centaur second stage.\"\n\nSunita, from Needham, Massachusetts, earned a physical science degree from the US Naval Academy and a master's in engineering management from the Florida Institute of Technology. Her first spaceflight was Expedition 14/15 (from December 2006 to June 2007), launching on space shuttle Discovery's STS-116 mission to reach the International Space Station, according to NASA.\n\nWhile onboard, Sunita established a world record for women at the time with four spacewalks. She concluded her tour of duty by returning to Earth with shuttle Atlantis' STS-117 flight, landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California on June 22, 2007.\n\nSelected as an astronaut by NASA in June 1998, Sunita has spent a total of 322 days in space on two missions and accumulated 50 hours and 40 minutes of cumulative EVA time on seven spacewalks.\n\nShe worked with Roscosmos on its contribution to the space station and with the first Expedition crew.\n\nMeanwhile, 61-year-old Barry Wilmore has logged 178 days in space and has spent 25 hours and 36 minutes on four spacewalks.\n\nYou are on Mint!

NASA Astronauts Pilot First Starliner Crewed Test to Station\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are safely in orbit on the first crewed flight test aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft bound for the International Space Station.\n\nAs part of NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test, the astronauts lifted off at 9:52 a.m. CDT June 5 on a ULA (United Launch Alliance) Atlas V rocket from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on an end-to-end test of the Starliner system.\n\nA United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft aboard launches from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on June 5. NASA's Boeing Crew Flight Test is the first launch with astronauts of the Boeing spacecraft and United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket to the International Space Station as part of the agency's Commercial Crew Program.NASA/Joel Kowsky\n\n\"Two bold NASA astronauts are well on their way on this historic first test flight of a brand-new spacecraft,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \"Boeing's Starliner marks a new chapter of American exploration. Human spaceflight is a daring task - but that's why it's worth doing. It's an exciting time for NASA, our commercial partners, and the future of exploration. Go Starliner, Go Butch and Suni!\"\n\nAs part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, the flight test will help validate the transportation system, launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, in-orbit operations capabilities, and return to Earth with astronauts aboard as the agency prepares to certify Starliner for rotational missions to the space station. Starliner previously flew two uncrewed orbital flights, including a test to and from the space station, along with a pad abort demonstration.\n\n\"With Starliner's launch, separation from the rocket, and arrival on orbit, Boeing's Crew Flight Test is right on track,\" said Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing's Commercial Crew Program. \"Everyone is focused on giving Suni and Butch a safe, comfortable, ride and performing a successful test mission from start to finish.\"\n\nDuring Starliner's flight, Boeing will monitor a series of automatic spacecraft maneuvers from its mission control center in Houston. NASA teams will monitor space station operations throughout the flight from the Mission Control Center at the agency's Johnson Space Center.\n\n\"Flying crew on Starliner represents over a decade of work by the Commercial Crew Program and our partners at Boeing and ULA,\" said Steve Stich, manager, Commercial Crew Program, at NASA's Johnson Space Center. \"For many of us, this is a career-defining moment bringing on a new crew transportation capability for our agency and our nation. We are going to take it one step at a time, putting Starliner through its paces, and remaining vigilant until Butch and Suni safely touch down back on Earth at the conclusion of this test flight.\"\n\nStarliner will autonomously dock to the forward-facing port of the station's Harmony module at approximately 11:15 a.m. June 6, and remain at the orbital laboratory for about a week.\n\nWilmore and Williams will help verify the spacecraft is performing as intended by testing the environmental control system, the displays and control system, and by maneuvering the thrusters, among other tests during flight.\n\nAfter a safe arrival at the space station, Wilmore and Williams will join the Expedition 71 crew of NASA astronauts Michael Barratt, Matt Dominick, Tracy C. Dyson, and Jeanette Epps, and Roscosmos cosmonauts Nikolai Chub, Alexander Grebenkin, and Oleg Kononenko.\n\nMission coverage will continue on NASA Television channels throughout Starliner's flight and resume on NASA+ prior to docking.\n\n/Public Release.

He also retweeted the US space agency's tweet that read \"Starliner to the stars!\"\n\nDuring a 2013 press conference at the National Science Centre in New Delhi, Sunita told reporters that during her space missions she carries with her the Bhagavad Gita and samosas.\n\nBoth Suni and Butch will remain in the ISS for about a week before undocking from the ISS re-enter Earth's atmosphere. It will make a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the southwestern United States on June 10, NASA said.\n\nAfter the successful lift off on Wednesday night, NASA chief Bill Nelson said in a post launch press conference termed it as a \"special moment.\" \"It's another one of those great markers in history,\" he said.\n\n\"Today's launch is a milestone achievement for the future of spaceflight,\" Nelson posted on X adding, \"Butch and Suni-safe travels through the stars. See you back home.\"\n\nBoth Boing and SpaceX received funding from NASA's Commercial Crew program in 2014 to carry astronauts to the ISS after the US space agency retired its Space Shuttle Program in 2011.\n\nBoeing received over USD 4 billion in US federal funds to develop the Starliner, while SpaceX received about USD 2.6 billion.\n\nSpaceX company's Crew Dragon has performed 12 crewed missions to the ISS since its first launch on May 30, 2020.\n\nBefore Wednesday's launch the last attempt to launch Boeing's Starliner spacecraft was scrubbed on Saturday less than four minutes before blastoff from the Kennedy Space Centre due to a ground system computer triggering an automatic abort command that shut down the launch sequence.\n\nOn May 6, NASA, Boeing and ULA \"scrubbed\" the launch due to a \"suspect oxygen relief valve on the Atlas V rocket's Centaur second stage\"\n\nSunita, from Needham, Massachusetts, earned a physical science degree from the US Naval Academy, and a master's in engineering management from the Florida Institute of Technology.\n\nHer first spaceflight was Expedition 14/15 (from December 2006 to June 2007) launching on space shuttle Discovery's STS-116 mission to reach the International Station, according to NASA.\n\nWhile onboard, Sunita established a world record for women at the time with four spacewalks. She concluded her tour of duty by returning to Earth with shuttle Atlantis' STS-117 flight to land at Edwards Air Force Base in California on June 22, 2007.\n\nSelected as an astronaut by NASA in June 1998, Sunita has spent a total of 322 days in space on two missions and accumulated 50 hours and 40 minutes of cumulative EVA time on seven spacewalks.\n\nShe worked with Roscosmos on its contribution to the space station and with the first Expedition crew.\n\nMeanwhile, 61-year-old, Barry Wilmore has logged 178 days in space and has 25 hours and 36 minutes of time on four spacewalks.

The CST-100 Starliner, with veteran astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams aboard, launched to space on Wednesday from Florida for a much-delayed test flight aimed at demonstrating the spacecraft's flightworthiness and sharpening Boeing's competition with Elon Musk's SpaceX.\n\nLaunched atop an Atlas V rocket furnished and flown by the Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA), the reusable gumdrop-shaped capsule has been in space for its one-day journey to the ISS, where it is scheduled to dock autonomously at around 12:15 p.m. ET (1615 GMT). During the flight, helium leaks were detected on Starliner's propulsion system, rendering unusable some of its 28 thrusters used to maneuver in space. The astronauts remain safe and the spacecraft has backup thrusters to compensate for the loss, according to NASA and Boeing.\n\nStarliner uses helium to add pressure to the propellant for its thrusters. NASA and Boeing did not specify the location of the downed thrusters or how quickly the helium was leaking. NASA mission managers on Thursday morning gave Boeing the green light to proceed with Starliner's docking to the ISS as the agency's space station office monitors the leak rate, NASA said.\n\nOnce securely coupled to the space laboratory, Wilmore and Williams would conduct a series of standard procedures, such as checking for airlock leaks and pressurizing the passage between the capsule and ISS, before opening the entry hatches. They would be welcomed aboard by the outpost's current seven resident crew members - four fellow U.S. astronauts and three Russian cosmonauts.\n\nPlans call for Wilmore and Williams to remain aboard the station for about eight days, then depart on a return flight that will take Starliner on a fiery re-entry back through Earths' atmosphere and end with a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the U.S. Desert Southwest, a first for a crewed NASA mission. The Starliner launch on Wednesday followed years of technical problems, various delays and a first successful 2022 test mission to the orbital laboratory without astronauts aboard.\n\nLast-minute issues had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts, including a helium leak found on the capsule's propulsion system that officials later determined was not serious enough to warrant a mechanical fix. NASA and Boeing officials at the time pointed to a faulty seal on one thruster component that was failing to keep the helium inside.\n\nBoeing built Starliner under contract with NASA to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been the U.S. space agency's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil. The current mission marks Starliner's first test flight with astronauts aboard, a requirement before NASA can certify the capsule for routine astronaut missions. Selected as crew for the pivotal flight were two NASA veterans who have previously logged 500 days in space between them - Wilmore, 61, a retired U.S. Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of two different U.S. rides to the ISS. The Starliner is several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget. Meanwhile, Boeing's commercial airplane manufacturing operations have been rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airlock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airlock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propellant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Propellant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(United_States_O-6)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (United States O-6)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/05_06_2024_10_02_33_3404755.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\n\"Let's get going!\" Wilmore called out a few minutes before liftoff.\n\nHalf an hour later, he and Williams were safely in orbit and giving chase to the space station. Back at Cape Canaveral, the relieved launch controllers stood and applauded. After all the trouble leading up to Wednesday's launch, including two scrapped countdowns, everything seemed to go smoothly before and during liftoff.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nWilmore and Williams -- retired Navy captains and former space station residents -- stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing's ability to get it right with this test flight. Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a safety issue.\n\n\"I know it's been a long road to get here,\" NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries -- Russia, the U.S. and China -- had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.", "source": {"uri": "macaudailytimes.com.mo", "dataType": "news", "title": "Macau Daily Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Launch pad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(United_States_O-6)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (United States O-6)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_propulsion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft propulsion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fincke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Fincke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Glenn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Glenn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/macaudailytimes.com.mo/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24157561366693.jpg?fit=670%2C376&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 646, "textEnd": 653}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Fifteen minutes later, after shedding two strap-on boosters and a core stage powered by a Russian RD-180 engine, the Atlas V's Centaur upper stage released Starliner right on target to begin a nearly 26-hour pursuit of the space station. Docking at the space station is set for 12:15 pm EDT (16:15 UTC) Thursday, where NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will spend at least a week before coming back to Earth.\n\nIn remarks shortly after Wednesday's launch, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Wilmore and Williams, both former US Navy pilots, will \"test this thing from izzard to gizzard\" to ensure Boeing's Starliner is ready for operational six-month crew rotation missions to the ISS.\n\nA long time coming\n\nThis is a big moment for NASA and Boeing. The launch of the Starliner test flight moves NASA closer to having access to two independent commercial spacecraft ferrying astronauts into low-Earth orbit, the cornerstone of an initiative the agency started working toward a decade-and-a-half ago. For Boeing, the first launch of astronauts aboard Starliner comes as the once-vaunted aerospace contractor wrestles with safety concerns over its workhorse 737 jetliner.\n\nNASA awarded Boeing a $4.2 billion contract to complete development of the Starliner spacecraft in 2014, with the goal of flying astronauts on the capsule beginning in 2017. The company first announced the spacecraft that became Starliner, then known only as the CST-100, in 2010 at the Farnborough International Airshow.\n\nAt the announcement in 2010, Boeing officials said they hoped to declare the CST-100 spacecraft operational in 2015, but Congress initially didn't appropriate the funding NASA said it needed to support development of new commercial crew vehicles after the retirement of the space shuttle. Then, Boeing ran into numerous technical issues, resulting in a major fuel leak during ground testing, an aborted unpiloted test flight to the space station in 2019, and further delays caused by valve corrosion. Another test flight in 2022 achieved all of Boeing's major objectives, setting the stage for the crew test flight.\n\nBut last year, officials discovered Boeing had mistakenly used flammable tape around wire bundles inside the Starliner spacecraft, leading to another schedule slip. Engineers also found they needed to redesign a component of the capsule's parachute system, punting the crew test flight into 2024.\n\nIn the meantime, SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft, which NASA supported alongside Boeing in the commercial crew program, started flying astronauts in 2020. It has now launched 13 crew missions for NASA and private customers.\n\nTwo previous tries to launch the Starliner crew test flight May 6 and June 1 were cut short by a faulty valve on the Atlas V rocket and a failed power supply for a ground computer at the launch pad. In the time between those two launch attempts, engineers discovered a small but persistent helium leak from Starliner's service module. Helium, which the spacecraft uses to push propellants from internal tanks to maneuvering thrusters, is an inert gas and non-toxic, and managers eventually determined the leak was stable and did not pose any unacceptable risk to the mission.\n\nThat led to approvals to proceed with the June 1 launch attempt, then another countdown Wednesday that was capped by the successful launch of Starliner. Milestones achieved early in the flight showed the spacecraft was performing well.\n\n\"We are off and running on the mission,\" Wilmore radioed mission control in Houston on Wednesday afternoon. \"And I can tell you, I wish we could have taken you all on that ascent. It was pretty thrilling.\"\n\n\"It was a little bit shocking that we actually launched,\" Williams said. This was the third time the two astronauts had strapped into the Starliner capsule in hopes of launching into space, following two scrubbed launch attempts May 6 and June 1.\n\n\"It was pretty cool to jump off the planet and then feel the Atlas V do its thing,\" Williams said. \"There were a few bumps here and there, a couple of Gs.\"\n\nThis was also the first time a crew launched on ULA's Atlas V rocket, which flew its 100th mission Wednesday. It's also the first time astronauts have launched on a member of the storied Atlas family of rockets since the the final flight of NASA's Mercury program in 1963.\n\nA few hours after launch, Wilmore and Williams each took turns at the controls of Starliner for a series of demonstrations to show that crew members could manually point and fly Starliner if its automation failed. Those checkouts all appeared to go well.\n\n\"Suni and I have done some manual maneuvering, and it is precise, more so even than the simulator,\" Wilmore said. \"I mean, stopping exactly on a number you want to stop on. The precision is pretty amazing.\"\n\nOne leak becomes three\n\nWhen he spoke to ground controllers Wednesday afternoon, Wilmore said, thus far, the Starliner test flight had \"just gone swimmingly.\" But as the crew prepared for an overnight sleep shift ahead of Thursday's docking at the space station, two new helium leaks popped up on Boeing's capsule.\n\nThe spacecraft's service module houses most of Starliner's propulsion system, including 20 larger orbital maneuvering engines and 28 less powerful reaction control system thrusters for fine pointing and smaller adjustments. Starliner has four doghouse-shaped propulsion pods around the circumference of the service module, with lines for hydrazine fuel, nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer, and helium pressurant routed into each thruster pack.\n\nTwo helium manifolds feed each doghouse. The leak discovered prior to Starliner's launch was traced to a flange in one manifold in the port, or left-side, doghouse pod. Late Wednesday, engineers detected two more helium leaks -- one with the other manifold in the port doghouse, and another in the doghouse on the top side of the service module.\n\nBrandon Burroughs, a Boeing engineer, described the two new helium leaks as \"small\" in a discussion broadcast on NASA TV's live coverage of the Starliner test flight. These leaks didn't appear during troubleshooting of the known leak on the ground.\n\nThree of Starliner's eight helium manifolds now show signs of leakage, and mission controllers told the crew they will have an update on the situation after they wake up at 4:30 am EDT (08:30 UTC) Thursday. It wasn't immediately clear how significant the leaks might be, or any immediate implications for the spacecraft's planned arrival at the space station.\n\n\"It looks like we picked up a couple more helium leaks,\" said Neal Negata, an engineer servicing as spacecraft communciator, or CAPCOM, in mission control. \"We're ready to copy find out exactly what you mean by picked up another helium leak, so give it to us,\" Wilmore radioed to the ground a few moments later.\n\nNegata told Wilmore they will isolate the manifolds newly discovered to be leaking helium, while the manifold known to be leaking before launch will remain open. \"That will give the teams the ability to manage the spacecraft,\" Burroughs said.\n\nBefore getting comfortable with launching with the known helium leak, engineers determined the Starliner spacecraft could handle up to four more helium leaks, even if the existing leak worsened, according to Steve Stich, NASA's commercial crew program manager.\n\n\"It's a tough system,\" Stich told reporters last month. \"This is a high-pressure system, and helium is a very small, tiny molecule, and it tends to leak.\"\n\nIn its current configuration, six of the spacecraft's 28 reaction control system thrusters will be disabled. The capsule has the ability to operate on a subset of its thrusters, and Burroughs said Boeing engineers believe \"the helium system remains safe for flight.\"\n\n\"This was not unexpected, and we plan for cases like this,\" he said. \"The team will be working to make sure we're in a good configuration to complete our mission, which is docking and rendezvous with the ISS.\"", "source": {"uri":

Now on its own, the spacecraft fired its onboard thrusters to start pushing itself into orbit, mission managers said, a process that will kick off its 24-hour catch-up journey with the ISS, the orbiting research outpost some 400 kilometres above Earth.\n\nStarliner will need to execute precise manoeuvres to dock with the ISS as planned on Thursday, demonstrate it can stay docked for about eight days, then safely return the two astronauts - Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams - to Earth.\n\nBoeing wants the Starliner to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been NASA's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from US soil.\n\nBoeing wrote on social media that Starliner \"has reached a safe, stable orbit on its Crew Flight Test\" and is headed to the space station.\n\n\"Starliner ascends to the heavens,\" NASA chief Bill Nelson wrote on social media, congratulating Boeing, ULA and the US space agency.\n\nNelson called the launch \"a milestone achievement for the future of spaceflight. Butch and Suni - safe travels through the stars. See you back home.\"\n\nLast-minute issues had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a glitch with a launchpad computer.\n\nThe inaugural crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran NASA astronauts: Wilmore, 61, a retired US Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nThey have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each. Wilmore is the designated commander for the flight, with Williams in the pilot seat. They are due to spend about a week at the ISS before returning to Earth.

They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\n\"Let's get going!\" Wilmore called out a few minutes before liftoff.\n\nHalf an hour later, he and Williams were safely in orbit and giving chase to the space station. Back at Cape Canaveral, the relieved launch controllers stood and applauded. After all the trouble leading up to Wednesday's launch, including two scrapped countdowns, everything went smoothly before and during liftoff, prompting congratulations from SpaceX's Elon Musk and others.\n\n\"Today it all lined up,\" said Boeing program manager Mark Nappi.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nWilmore and Williams -- retired Navy captains and former space station residents -- stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing's ability to get it right with this test flight. Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but remained extremely low and manageable.\n\n\"It's just a tough endeavor to get to flight and huge kudos to the entire team for getting there,\" said Steve Stich, NASA's commercial crew program manager.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries -- Russia, the U.S. and China -- had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems. The only snag early in the flight involved the capsule's cooling system. More water was used than expected before the radiators took over in orbit. The tank will be refilled before the ride home.\n\nBoeing's Starliner capsule lifts off Wednesday atop an Atlas V rocket from Space Launch Complex 41 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Fla., on a mission to the International Space Station.

It is scheduled at 12:15 p.m. ET (1615 GMT) to dock autonomously with the ISS, which orbits some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. It is due to stay docked for about eight days, then safely return the two astronauts to Earth, among other flight objectives.\n\nIts launch on Wednesday followed years of technical problems, various delays and a successful 2022 test mission to the orbital laboratory without astronauts aboard.\n\nBoeing intends for Starliner - seeded with NASA funding - to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been the U.S. space agency's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil. The mission is a test flight required before NASA can certify Starliner for routine astronaut missions.\n\nThe seven-seat Starliner's inaugural crew includes two veteran NASA astronauts in Wilmore, 61, a retired U.S. Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of two different U.S. rides to the ISS. The Starliner is several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget. Meanwhile, Boeing's commercial airplane operations have been rocked by crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space rendezvous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Redundancy (engineering)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fighter pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(naval)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (naval)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/trkd-images/LYNXMPEK550DQ_M.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Bob Hines/NASA\n\nBoeing's Starliner spacecraft launched on the morning of June 5, 2024, sending astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams into space. Following a delay of several years, this was the third launch attempt made over the past month after issues with both the spacecraft and ground system.\n\nThough the spacecraft still needs to dock with the International Space Station and return the astronauts home, this successful launch marks a major step for both Boeing and NASA.\n\nPart of NASA's commercial crew program, this long-delayed mission represents the vehicle's first crewed launch. Its success will give NASA - and in the future, space tourists - more options for getting to low Earth orbit.\n\nFrom my perspective as a space policy expert, Starliner's launch represents another significant milestone in the development of the commercial space industry. But the mission's troubled history also shows just how difficult the path to space can be, even for an experienced company like Boeing.\n\nFollowing the retirement of NASA's space shuttle in 2011, NASA invited commercial space companies to help the agency transport cargo and crew to the International Space Station.\n\nIn 2014, NASA selected Boeing and SpaceX to build their respective crew vehicles: Starliner and Dragon.\n\nBoeing's vehicle, Starliner, was built to carry up to seven crew members to and from low Earth orbit. For NASA missions to the International Space Station, it will carry up to four at a time, and it's designed to remain docked to the station for up to seven months. At 15 feet (4.57 meters), the capsule where the crew will sit is slightly bigger than an Apollo command module or a SpaceX Dragon.\n\nBoeing designed Starliner to be partially reusable to reduce the cost of getting to space. Though the Atlas V rocket it will take to space and the service module that supports the craft are both expendable, Starliner's crew capsule can be reused up to 10 times, with a six-month turnaround. Boeing has built two flightworthy Starliners to date.\n\nStarliner's development has come with setbacks. Though Boeing received US$4.2 billion from NASA, compared with $2.6 billion for SpaceX, Boeing spent more than $1.5 billion extra in developing the spacecraft.\n\nOn Starliner's first uncrewed test flight in 2019, a series of software and hardware failures prevented it from getting to its planned orbit as well as docking with the International Space Station. After testing out some of its systems, it landed successfully at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.\n\nIn 2022, after identifying and making more than 80 fixes, Starliner conducted a second uncrewed test flight. This time, the vehicle did successfully dock with the International Space Station and landed six days later in New Mexico.\n\nStill, Boeing delayed the first crewed launch for Starliner from 2023 to 2024 because of additional problems. One involved Starliner's parachutes, which help to slow the vehicle as it returns to Earth. Tests found that some links in those parachute lines were weaker than expected, which could have caused them to break. A second problem was the use of flammable tape that could pose a fire hazard.\n\nA major question stemming from these delays concerns why Starliner has been so difficult to develop. For one, NASA officials admitted that it did not provide as much oversight for Starliner as it did for SpaceX's Dragon because of the agency's familiarity with Boeing.\n\nAnd Boeing has experienced several problems recently, most visibly with the safety of its airplanes. Astronaut Butch Wilmore has denied that Starliner's problems reflect these troubles.\n\nBut several of Boeing's other space activities beyond Starliner have also experienced mechanical failures and budget pressure, including the Space Launch System. This system is planned to be the main rocket for NASA's Artemis program, which plans to return humans to the Moon for the first time since the Apollo era.\n\nGiven these difficulties, Starliner's success will be important for Boeing's future space efforts. Even if SpaceX's Dragon can successfully transport NASA astronauts to the International Space Station, the agency needs a backup. And that's where Starliner comes in.\n\nFollowing the Challenger explosion in 1986 and the Columbia shuttle accident in 2003, NASA retired the space shuttle in 2011. The agency was left with few options to get astronauts to and from space. Having a second commercial crew vehicle provider means that NASA will not have to depend on one company or vehicle for space launches as it previously had to.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, the successful launch means Starliner may be able to compete with SpaceX. Though there's no crushing demand for space tourism right now, and Boeing has no plans to market Starliner for tourism anytime soon, competition is important in any market to drive down costs and increase innovation.\n\nMore such competition is likely coming. Sierra Space's Dream Chaser is planning to launch later this year to transport cargo for NASA to the International Space Station. A crewed version of the space plane is also being developed for the next round of NASA's commercial crew program. Blue Origin is working with NASA in this latest round of commercial crew contracts and developing a lunar lander for the Artemis program.\n\nThough SpaceX has made commercial spaceflight look relatively easy, Boeing's rocky experience with Starliner shows just how hard spaceflight continues to be, even for an experienced company.\n\nStarliner is important not just for NASA and Boeing, but to demonstrate that more than one company can find success in the commercial space industry. The successful launch has likely given NASA more confidence in the industry's ability to support operations in Earth's orbit while the agency focuses on future missions to the Moon and beyond.", "source": {"uri": "stuff.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stuff"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Low Earth orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hines_(astronaut)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Hines (astronaut)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expendable_launch_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Expendable launch system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Missile_Range", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White Sands Missile Range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artemis program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blue Origin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://stuff.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Boeings-Starliner-The-Conversation-NASA.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

The duo made the record books not only as the first humans to ride Starliner, but also the first to launch atop ULA's veteran Atlas V rocket.\n\n\"This is a special moment. It's another one of those great markers in history,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said during a post-launch press conference today at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, near the launch site, Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.\n\n\"What NASA does is hard,\" Nelson added. \"Spaceflight is hard, but it's worth doing.\"\n\nRelated: I flew Boeing's Starliner spacecraft in 4 different simulators. Here's what I learned (video, photos)\n\nToday's launch marked the first time astronauts have left Earth from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (or its many previous incarnations, which included Cape Kennedy Air Force Station and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station) since Apollo 7 in 1968. But more will likely follow in its footsteps soon.\n\nThe agency's other commercial crew vendor, SpaceX, has already sent astronauts to space multiple times, first notching this milestone four years ago. SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which built off the company's successful cargo Dragon design, carried its first astronauts to space on a test flight in May 2020. Boeing, working with a new spacecraft, needed extra time to achieve the same thing.\n\nStarliner's first uncrewed test flight, in December 2019, suffered several software glitches that kept the spacecraft in the wrong orbit, unable to reach the ISS. The second uncrewed effort, which launched in May 2022, was successful: Starliner arrived at the ISS safely. Yet the newly launched astronaut mission, known as Crew Flight Test (CFT), faced new delays in 2023 after significant issues were found with Starliner's parachute system and wiring (much of which was wrapped in flammable tape); these necessitated fixes, which took time.\n\nSeveral other, more minor issues cropped up right before launch. CFT was supposed to get off the ground on May 6, but the team called that try off about two hours before launch after noticing a misbehaving valve in the Atlas V's upper stage. ULA decided to replace the valve, which pushed the next try back to May 17. But then teams noticed a slight helium leak in one of Starliner's reaction-control thrusters, which delayed things further. Ultimately, NASA, Boeing and ULA deemed the helium leak a minor issue and cleared CFT for launch on June 1. That try, however, was aborted just minutes before liftoff thanks to faulty ground equipment, pushing liftoff back to today.\n\n\"I know it's really easy to lose patience as you're waiting for launches to happen,\" Ken Bowersox, associate administrator for NASA's Space Operations Mission Directorate, said during today's press conference. \"But, as I said before, good things are worth waiting for.\"\n\nThe focus of the CFT team is now on making sure Wilmore and Williams safely reach the ISS while testing key systems along the way. The duo will do some manual flying, for example, to get a feel for Starliner's various systems.\n\nWilmore and Williams are \"going to test this thing from izzard to gizzard, and they're going to certify it for a rotational basis to send crew to the International Space Station,\" Nelson said. (\"Izzard,\" in case you were wondering, is another word for the letter \"z.\")\n\nIf all goes according to plan, Starliner will dock autonomously with the orbiting facility tomorrow (June 6) around 12:15 p.m. EDT (1615 GMT), a milestone that you can watch live here at Space.com.\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\n-- Boeing Starliner astronauts conduct dress rehearsal ahead of May 6 launch (photos, video)\n\n-- Boeing's Starliner spacecraft will not fly private missions yet, officials say\n\n-- 'I'm sure we'll find things out': NASA astronauts fly to launch site for 1st crewed Boeing Starliner mission to ISS on May 6 (photos)\n\nAssuming the roughly 10-day-long CFT goes as planned and the mission meets all major objectives, Boeing's first operational mission, Starliner-1, is scheduled for no earlier than 2025. That coming mission's commander, NASA astronaut Mike Fincke, was backup on CFT, while mission specialist and Canadian Space Agency astronaut Josh Kutryk worked ascent as capcom (capsule communicator). Also on board Starliner-1 will be NASA's Scott Tingle.\n\nKeeping the Starliner-1 crew tightly integrated with CFT was a key goal in training, to smooth the flow between the missions as much as possible, Boeing and NASA have emphasized, as the ISS seeks to welcome U.S.-led crews every six months. The goal is for Dragon and Starliner to alternate launch opportunities.\n\nRussia likely will not fly a cosmonaut aboard Starliner-1, as the country is waiting for more data on the spacecraft, NASA officials said in a press conference on May 3. How that will affect integrated crews in the future remains to be seen, as NASA plans to continue flying its astronauts aboard Russia's Soyuz spacecraft for backup and policy reasons.\n\nBoeing is expected to fly six or seven operational Starliner crews until the planned retirement of ISS in 2030, although it is possible Starliner will continue to serve the agency, helping NASA astronauts get to and from commercial space stations planned in the next decade.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrator_of_NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Administrator of NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_7", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apollo 7"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Bowersox", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ken Bowersox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fincke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Fincke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_D._Tingle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott D.

Image courtesy: Wikimedia commons\n\nBoeing's Starliner capsule finally launched into space with a two-person crew on board. Aboard this historic flight is Sunita Williams, an Indian-origin National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronaut.\n\nWe explain why this spaceflight, Williams' third is historic. We also dive into what this will mean for the United States' effort to maintain independent access to space for its astronauts.\n\nBut first, a little bit about Boeing's Starliner mission.\n\nBoeing CST-100 Starliner mission overview\n\nThe Boeing CST-100 Starliner is a spacecraft developed under NASA's Commercial Crew Program. This initiative aims to provide safe, reliable, and cost-effective transportation to the International Space Station (ISS) and other low Earth orbit (LEO) destinations. The Starliner can carry up to seven passengers or a combination of crew and cargo, and is designed for reusability up to ten times with a six-month turnaround.\n\nIts capability for autonomous docking with the ISS, along with provisions for manual control, highlights its advanced technological design. Named Calypso by Williams in homage to Jacques Cousteau's research vessel, the Starliner embodies a spirit of exploration and discovery.\n\nA milestone for Sunita Williams, women\n\nSunita Williams' involvement in this mission is a landmark achievement in multiple ways. At 59, Williams has already had an illustrious career in space, and this mission further solidifies her place in history.\n\nBy flying on the Starliner, she became the first woman to test an orbital spacecraft on its maiden crewed flight. This milestone is a significant moment for women in aerospace, a nod to the continued progress in gender representation in space exploration.\n\nWilliams' extensive background, including previous long-duration stays on the ISS and participation in numerous spacewalks, brings invaluable expertise to the Starliner's trial.\n\nOvercoming delays and challenges\n\nThe Starliner mission has faced numerous delays and technical challenges, a testament to the broader organisational issues within Boeing. Originally scheduled for earlier launches, the mission was delayed due to issues in the propulsion system and to check a helium leak. The significance of the spaceflight is also high because of the built-up anticipation.\n\nThe mission's success is crucial in breaking the current monopoly held by SpaceX in providing crewed transportation to the ISS. Since the retirement of the Space Shuttle program in 2011, NASA has relied heavily on Russian Soyuz rockets and, more recently, SpaceX's Dragon capsules.\n\nIf the Starliner is successful, it will herald Boeing's entry into this domain, breaking SpaceX's dominance and diversifying the options for NASA to send its astronauts to space. It would also strengthen the US' position in maintaining independent access to space. This independence is strategically vital, reducing reliance on international partners and enhancing the nation's capability to conduct uninterrupted space missions.\n\nThe 100th launch of the Atlas V rocket\n\nThe Starliner's mission, carrying veteran NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Williams, launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station aboard United Launch Alliance's (ULA) Atlas V rocket.\n\nAnother aspect that adds to the significance of this mission is the fact that it marked the 100th launch of the Atlas V rocket. The Atlas V has been a workhorse for NASA and the Department of Defense, launching satellites and other critical payloads into space. Its legacy dates back to the early days of space exploration, including John Glenn's historic orbit around Earth in 1962. The successful launch of the Starliner on this iconic rocket underscores the reliability and enduring importance of the Atlas V in the annals of American space history.\n\nWilliams' historic flight, the overcoming of significant delays, and the commemoration of the 100th Atlas V launch are all responsible for the high importance accorded to this mission.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-rating_certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human-rating certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Low Earth orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extravehicular activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space exploration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_retirement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle retirement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Glenn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Glenn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geocentric orbit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/04/Sunita-Williams-set-for-third-space-mission-will-join-NASAs-Boeing-Crew-Flight-Test-to-ISS-2024-04-1ef5e709793858dc069a3cb7734c21a3-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

It is due to stay docked for about eight days, then safely return the two astronauts to Earth.\n\nBoeing's BA.N Starliner capsule faces a crucial test on Thursday, June 6, when it is expected to dock with the International Space Station (ISS) on the spacecraft's first trip to orbit carrying astronauts, as the aerospace giant looks to sharpen its competition with Elon Musk's SpaceX.\n\nThe CST-100 Starliner, with astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams aboard, was launched from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida on Wednesday, strapped to an Atlas V rocket furnished and flown by the Boeing-Lockheed Martin LMT.N joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA).\n\nThe reusable gumdrop-shaped capsule and its crew have a rendezvous with the ISS. It is scheduled at 12:15 p.m. ET (1615 GMT) to dock autonomously with the ISS, which orbits some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. It is due to stay docked for about eight days, then safely return the two astronauts to Earth, among other flight objectives.\n\nIts launch on Wednesday followed years of technical problems, various delays and a successful 2022 test mission to the orbital laboratory without astronauts aboard.\n\nBoeing intends for Starliner - seeded with NASA funding - to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been the US space agency's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from US soil. The mission is a test flight required before NASA can certify Starliner for routine astronaut missions.\n\nThe seven-seat Starliner's inaugural crew includes two veteran NASA astronauts in Wilmore, 61, a retired US Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of two different U.S. rides to the ISS. The Starliner is several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget. Meanwhile, Boeing's commercial airplane operations have been rocked by crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners. - Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rappler"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space rendezvous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(United_States_O-6)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (United States O-6)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Redundancy (engineering)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fighter pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/06/launch-june5-2024_SPACE-EXPLORATION-BOEING-STARLINER.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 267, "textEnd": 273}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

She had helped design the Starliner, working with engineers from NASA and Boeing.\n\n\"When I reach the International Space Station, it will be like going back home,\" she said.\n\nAccording to Boeing, the company that made the Starliner at a cost of over $4.2 billion, the astronauts are safe and \"on the way to the International Space Station.\"\n\nButch Wilmore and Suni Williams tested out a unique capability of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft on orbit - manual piloting. Although the spacecraft is usually autonomous, the crew used the hand controller to point and aim the spacecraft during about two hours of free-flight demonstrations.\n\n\"We've also spun out the manual manoeuvring and it is precise, much more so than even the simulator,\" said Mr Wilmore. \"Stopping exactly on a number you want to stop on, the precision is pretty amazing.\"\n\nBoeing says the astronauts then manually sped up the Starliner and slowed it down, which slightly raised and then lowered their orbit. This was to show that the crew could manually break away from the space station orbit during rendezvous, if necessary.\n\nThe SUV-sized Starliner can accommodate seven crew, but on this first test flight only two are being flown.\n\nNASA says if all goes well, the Starliner will dock to the forward-facing port of the station's Harmony module and Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore will remain at the space station for about a week to test the Starliner spacecraft and its subsystems before NASA works to complete final certification of the transportation system for rotational missions to the orbiting laboratory as part of the agency's Commercial Crew Programme.\n\nIt said the Starliner has been designed for astronauts by astronauts and is the most modern crew module ever to be flown.\n\nBoeing says once in a stable orbit on course for the International Space Station, the Starliner will begin its rendezvous procedures. As the Starliner closes on the station, the vehicle's star tracker cameras will first see the orbiting lab as a distant, but bright, point of light moving in front of a background of fixed stars.\n\nOver the next few hours, Starliner will slowly move itself closer to the station and then pause before entering the 200-metre \"keep out sphere\" until station flight controllers clear it to enter. Starliner then begins the docking process, pausing once more 10 meters away from a Boeing-built International Docking Adapter and then continuing to final approach and docking.\n\nPromotedListen to

oceanographer and legendary filmmaker Jacques-Yves Cousteau explored the oceans when she was still a student.\n\nShe also has a school named after her, the Sunita Williams Elementary School, in the town of Needham in the US, and if all goes well, she will talk to schoolchildren on June 10 from aboard the space station.", "source": {"uri": "ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV"},

Human spaceflight is a daring task - but that's why it's worth doing. It's an exciting time for NASA, our commercial partners, and the future of exploration. Go Starliner, Go Butch and Suni!\"\n\nAs part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, the flight test will help validate the transportation system, launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, in-orbit operations capabilities, and return to Earth with astronauts aboard as the agency prepares to certify Starliner for rotational missions to the space station. Starliner previously flew two uncrewed orbital flights, including a test to and from the space station, along with a pad abort demonstration.\n\n\"With Starliner's launch, separation from the rocket, and arrival on orbit, Boeing's Crew Flight Test is right on track,\" said Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing's Commercial Crew Program. \"Everyone is focused on giving Suni and Butch a safe, comfortable, ride and performing a successful test mission from start to finish.\"\n\nDuring Starliner's flight, Boeing will monitor a series of automatic spacecraft maneuvers from its mission control center in Houston. NASA teams will monitor space station operations throughout the flight from the Mission Control Center at the agency's Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n\n\"Flying crew on Starliner represents over a decade of work by the Commercial Crew Program and our partners at Boeing and ULA,\" said Steve Stich, manager, Commercial Crew Program, at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. \"For many of us, this is a career-defining moment bringing on a new crew transportation capability for our agency and our nation. We are going to take it one step at a time, putting Starliner through its paces, and remaining vigilant until Butch and Suni safely touch down back on Earth at the conclusion of this test flight.\"\n\nStarliner will autonomously dock to the forward-facing port of the station's Harmony module at approximately 12:15pm Thursday, June 6th, and remain at the orbital laboratory for about a week.\n\nWilmore and Williams will help verify the spacecraft is performing as intended by testing the environmental control system, the displays and control system, and by maneuvering the thrusters, among other tests during flight.\n\nAfter a safe arrival at the space station, Wilmore and Williams will join the Expedition 71 crew of NASA astronauts Michael Barratt, Matt Dominick, Tracy C. Dyson, and Jeanette Epps, and Roscosmos cosmonauts Nikolai Chub, Alexander Grebenkin, and Oleg Kononenko.\n\nNASA's arrival and in-flight event coverage is as follows (all times Eastern and subject to change based on real-time operations):\n\nMission coverage will continue on NASA Television channels throughout Starliner's flight and resume on NASA+ prior to docking.\n\n3:30pm - Post-docking news conference at NASA Johnson with the following participants:\n\nCoverage of the post-docking news conference will air live on NASA+, NASA Television, the NASA app, YouTube, and the agency's website.\n\nTo attend the post-docking briefing, U.S. media must contact the NASA Johnson newsroom at: jsccommu@mail.nasa.gov or 281.483.5111 by 1:00pm Thursday, June 6th.

A veteran of two spaceflights, Wilmore has 178 days in space under his belt. In 2009, he served as a pilot aboard space shuttle Atlantis for the STS-129 mission. Additionally, Wilmore served as a flight engineer for Expedition 41 until November 2014, when he assumed command of the space station after arrival of the Expedition 42 crew. He returned to Earth the following March. Prior to his selection by NASA in 2000, the father of two obtained both his bachelor's degree and master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Tennessee Technological University, Cookeville, before graduating with another master's degree in Aviation Systems from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. He is also a graduate of the United States Naval Test Pilot School, Patuxent River, Maryland, and has completed four operational deployments during his tenure as a fleet naval officer and aviator.\n\nWilliams is the spacecraft pilot for the flight test. Williams has spent 322 days in space across two missions: Expedition 14/15 in 2006 through 2007, and Expedition 32/33 in 2012. The Massachusetts native also conducted seven spacewalks, totaling 50 hours and 40 minutes. Before her career began with NASA in 1998, Williams graduated with her bachelor's degree in Physical Science from the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, before obtaining her master's degree in Engineering Management from the Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne. In total, she has logged more than 3,000 flight hours in over 30 different aircraft.\n\nNASA's Commercial Crew Program has delivered on its goal of safe, reliable, and cost-effective transportation to and from the International Space Station from the United States through a partnership with American private industry. This partnership is changing the arc of human spaceflight history by opening access to low Earth orbit and the space station to more people, science, and commercial opportunities. The space station remains the springboard to NASA's next great leap in space exploration, including future missions to the Moon under Artemis and, eventually, Mars.\n\nLearn more about NASA's

They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\n\"Let's get going!\" Wilmore called out a few minutes before liftoff.\n\nHalf an hour later, he and Williams were safely in orbit and giving chase to the space station. Back at Cape Canaveral, the relieved launch controllers stood and applauded. After all the trouble leading up to Wednesday's launch, including two scrapped countdowns, everything went smoothly before and during liftoff, prompting congratulations from SpaceX's Elon Musk and others.\n\n\"Today it all lined up,\" said Boeing program manager Mark Nappi.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nWilmore and Williams - retired Navy captains and former space station residents - stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing's ability to get it right with this test flight. Crippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but remained extremely low and manageable.\n\n\"It's just a tough endeavor to get to flight and huge kudos to the entire team for getting there,\" said Steve Stich, NASA's commercial crew program manager.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Elon Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nMore: Ed Dwight, America's first Black astronaut candidate, finally goes to space 60 years later\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries - Russia, the U.S. and China - had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems. The only snag early in the flight involved the capsule's cooling system. More water was used than expected before the radiators took over in orbit. The tank will be refilled before the ride home.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"This is exciting. We built up to this moment for years and years, and it finally happened,\" Fincke said from neighboring Kennedy Space Center. \"I feel like the whole planet was cheering for them.\"", "source":

It is scheduled at 12:15 p.m. ET (1615 GMT) to dock autonomously with the ISS, which orbits some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. It is due to stay docked for about eight days, then safely return the two astronauts to Earth, among other flight objectives.\n\nIts launch on Wednesday followed years of technical problems, various delays and a successful 2022 test mission to the orbital laboratory without astronauts aboard.\n\nBoeing intends for Starliner - seeded with NASA funding - to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been the U.S. space agency's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil. The mission is a test flight required before NASA can certify Starliner for routine astronaut missions.\n\nThe seven-seat Starliner's inaugural crew includes two veteran NASA astronauts in Wilmore, 61, a retired U.S. Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of two different U.S. rides to the ISS. The Starliner is several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget. Meanwhile, Boeing's commercial airplane operations have been rocked by crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners.\n\nReporting by Joey Roulette in Washington; Editing by Will Dunham", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joey_roulette@reuters.com", "name": "Joey Roulette", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reusable launch vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space rendezvous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(United_States_O-6)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (United States O-6)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Redundancy (engineering)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fighter pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TR5JBBBGCFIUTNCRFXRM6NUMIQ.jpg?auth=b732547b106df10b00fa632e8500a02e73b968b4b484535962aa57b842e6c528&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

The autonomous spacecraft will have to catch up to the space station, traveling at 17,500 mph, and park itself at one of the orbiting laboratory's docking ports. Along the way, NASA astronauts Sunita \"Suni\" Williams and Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, the first to ever fly on Starliner, will take manual control of the vehicle to see how it performs.\n\nAfter docking with the space station, which is scheduled for 12:15 p.m. Thursday, the capsule will spend about a week or more attached to the orbiting laboratory. Then crews will inspect the capsule to determine whether it could serve as a safe haven in the event of an emergency on the station, as well as how it operates in the vacuum of space.\n\nThe launch came after two canceled attempts, as engineers had to delay a few weeks to resolve a valve and computer issue with the rocket as well as a helium leak affecting the spacecraft's propulsion system. While the mission is far from complete, officials from NASA and Boeing said after the launch that they felt a sense of relief - and redemption.\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson called the launch \"another milestone in this extraordinary history of NASA. And I want to give my personal congratulations to the whole team that went through a lot of trial and tribulation. But they had perseverance.\"\n\nOfficials said the countdown proceeded very smoothly and that no major issues had come up. \"So far, we're really not tracking hardly anything,\" Steve Stich, NASA's commercial crew program manager, said after the launch.\n\nA few hours after liftoff, Wilmore and Williams were able to radio to the ground and were in good spirits. \"It's just fun to be in space again,\" said Williams, a veteran of two previous space missions with 322 cumulative days in space. \"I got to unstrap first, and I was like, 'Oh, yeah, I'm floating. That's pretty awesome.'\"\n\nDuring the liftoff, the rocket was \"really smooth,\" Wilmore said. \"We were off and running.\"\n\nThe end of the mission is a fiery descent through Earth's atmosphere, testing whether the spacecraft's heat shield and parachutes work as expected before a planned landing at one of five remote sites in the Western United States. The earliest opportunity for landing would be June 14, Stich said, adding that it could come later because of activity on the space station. \"There's nothing magic about that date,\" he said. \"A few days later, we have another set of opportunities as well.\"\n\nBoeing's Mark Nappi, who oversees the Starliner program for the company, said that the launch \"is just the first part of this\" and that the teams won't celebrate until the capsule is back on Earth with the crew safe: \"Our team is really focused on that.\"\n\nAfter years of criticism, he said he talked to his \"team a lot about just ignoring a lot of the stuff that you read. We focus on the positive. We focus on the accomplishments, and we learn from the setbacks that we've had.\"\n\nIf all goes well, NASA would certify Starliner for regular crewed rotation missions, carrying a full contingent of four astronauts to the space station. That would, for the first time, give the space agency two American-made vehicles to ferry astronauts there. Since 2020, Space X has been flying those missions alone, but NASA has long wanted two spacecraft for its \"commercial crew\" program so that if one went down it would have a backup. Russia also flies crews to the orbiting laboratory.\n\nNASA and Boeing originally hoped to launch the mission May 6 but were forced to delay because of a malfunctioning valve on the rocket. Since then, they also discovered a small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system but determined it was so small it would not pose a risk to the flight. On Saturday, a computer aborted the launch sequence with less than four minutes to go.\n\nFrom the beginning of the program, Boeing was favored to fly first, and many wondered whether NASA would even bother offering a contract to SpaceX. In 2014, NASA awarded Boeing $4.2 billion; SpaceX won $2.6 billion for the same number of flights.\n\nSince then, SpaceX has become the dominant commercial rocket and spacecraft manufacturer. It flew astronauts first, completing its first crewed test mission in May 2020. That flight was a major coup for NASA that finally gave it a way to get its crews to space. In 2011, the space shuttle was retired, forcing NASA to rely on Russia to fly people to the station until SpaceX started flying.\n\nBoeing's Starliner, meanwhile, faced some challenges, from software that wasn't fully tested to stuck valves, as well as a parachute system that needed to be redesigned. Along the way, it had to fly two test flights without crew on board, instead of one as had been anticipated - because of the problems. Its first attempt, in late 2019, was cut short because the spacecraft's onboard computer was off by 11 hours and the spacecraft never reached the station. Finally, on its next flight in 2022, it reached the space station.\n\nBut after that flight, the company discovered that tape used to cover electrical wiring in the capsule was flammable and that its parachutes needed an upgrade.\n\nNASA officials publicly supported Boeing and worked steadily to help it get Starliner to the point where it could fly astronauts safely. But they also said they should have exerted more vigorous oversight over the company as it worked to develop the spacecraft.\n\nThe mishaps have cost the company about $1.4 billion. Boeing executives have said that while the company would complete its contract with NASA to fly as many as six operational missions to the station, the future of Starliner is uncertain, given the losses.\n\nBoeing hopes the successful liftoff will mark a turning point for the program - and the company's ambitions. The flight comes as its commercial aviation division faces probes related to how a door plug blew off a 737 Max airplane in January shortly after takeoff of an Alaska Airlines flight. The company is also shuffling its leadership and replacing CEO Dave Calhoun, who took over the company after another disaster - the crashes of two 737 Max airplanes that killed 346 people in 2018 and 2019.\n\nWilliams, a veteran NASA astronaut who had waited years for the flight, said in an interview that since it was a test flight she expected issues to crop up that would be fixed for future flights. Still, she said, NASA and Boeing would not fly unless they were convinced they could do so safely.\n\n\"We do anticipate everything's going to go as planned,\" she said in an interview. \"But if it doesn't, we'll take a moment and analyze it and talk about it, and we'll be okay. So our confidence in the mission is high.\"", "source": {"uri": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp", "dataType": "news", "title": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western US on June 14.\n\n\"Let's get going!\" Mr Wilmore called out a few minutes before lift-off.\n\nHalf an hour later, he and Ms Williams were safely in orbit and giving chase to the space station. Back at Cape Canaveral, the relieved launch controllers stood and applauded.\n\nAfter all the trouble leading up to Wednesday's launch, including two scrapped countdowns, everything went smoothly before and during lift-off, prompting congratulations from SpaceX's Elon Musk and others.\n\n\"Today it all lined up,\" said Boeing program manager Mark Nappi.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its aircraft side.\n\nMr Wilmore and Ms Williams -- retired Navy captains and former space station residents -- stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing's ability to get it right with this test flight.\n\nCrippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays, but remained extremely low and manageable.\n\n\"It's just a tough endeavour to get to flight and huge kudos to the entire team for getting there,\" said Steve Stich, NASA's commercial crew program manager.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Mr Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing US companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying US$4.2 billion ($6.3b) to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\nSpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first private business to achieve what only three countries -- Russia, the US and China -- had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters flights.\n\nThe lift-off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn's Mercury era more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nDespite the Atlas V's perfect record, the human presence cranked up the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.\n\nBoeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon are designed to be fully autonomous and reusable. Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams occasionally will take manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check out its systems.\n\nThe only snag early in the flight involved the capsule's cooling system. More water was used than expected before the radiators took over in orbit. The tank will be refilled before the ride home.\n\nIf the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner's next trip.\n\n\"This is exciting. We built up to this moment for years and years, and it finally happened,\" Mr Fincke said from neighbouring Kennedy Space Centre.\n\n\"I feel like the whole planet was cheering for them.\"", "source":

They awoke at 4:30 a.m. asking for an update after teams identified hours after launch two more helium leaks on top of one that was already known of before launch.\n\n\"Actually, umm, we're kind of curious where we stand as far as our leaks. If we could get a summary on that, that would be wonderful,\" Wilmore said.\n\nTwo of the valves were closed with the spacecraft remaining stable, according to NASA.\n\n\"Regarding the leaks we spoke of last night, the big picture is the current leak rates are, we are going to be able to support a rendezvous today with that,\" replied the NASA capsule communications officer Rob Hayhurst from Houston.\n\nNASA said the propellant team is working to increase pressure on parts of the propulsion system so the NASA astronauts would have adequate use of the engine jets to perform the planned test maneuvers before docking, but teams with NASA and Boeing will review data before the approach.\n\nThe helium leak that was known of before launch was the subject of several days of delay as teams determined the safety to the astronauts even if the leak got worse. Teams also worked through potential landing procedures if leaks were to spring up on more of the engines on the propulsion module to ensure Starliner could make it back to Earth.\n\nBoeing's Starliner launches on historic 1st human spaceflight for NASA\n\nTheir arrival slated for 12:15 p.m. would come more than 25 hours after launching from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket.\n\nThe ISS population will temporarily go up to nine as Wilmore and Williams join the seven members of Expedition 71. That includes the four members of SpaceX's Crew-8 that flew up to the station in February on the Crew Dragon Endeavour.\n\n\"I'm really looking forward to seeing two U.S. vehicles at the International Space Station,\" said Ken Bowersox, the associate administrator for NASA's Space Operations Mission Directorate during a post-launch press conference Wednesday. \"I know Butch and Suni will probably get a kick out of that, if they get a chance, to look out the windows and see a Dragon there, see a Starliner there. It's something that I think all of us should be proud of.\"\n\nThe point of the CFT mission is so Boeing can join SpaceX as one of two companies providing regular ferry service to and from the ISS under NASA's Commercial Crew Program, something meant to end NASA's reliance on Russia's Soyuz flights after the end of the Space Shuttle Program in 2011.\n\nSpaceX achieved that first beginning in May 2020, and has been handling the U.S.-based launches for that program for four years already having flown its fleet of Crew Dragon spacecraft 13 times carrying 50 humans to space.\n\nBoeing, now, though, looks to complete the CFT so Starliner can be certified for its contracted six rotational missions to the ISS that could begin as early as February 2025.\n\n\"Launch is just the first part of this,\" said Boeing's Mark Nappi, the company's commercial crew program lead. \"We now have to get to ISS, we have to dock, we have to do docking opps, we have to undock, we have to do reentry and we have to land. So each one of those phases we're going to really pay very, very close attention to and our team is really focused on that.\"\n\nWilmore and Williams took care of some of the test flight agenda items on the flight up to the ISS including trying out some manual control overrides for what is supposed to be a mostly automated spacecraft. While on board, they will also make sure Starliner can act as a lifeboat for a full ISS crew in case of an issue with the space station. And they will try out more manual maneuvers on the return home.\n\nPlans will keep them docked to the ISS for about eight days, and the return flight will have them make a desert landing in one of five predetermined sites in the southwestern United States.\n\n\"This is a test flight,\" Nappi said. \"We're going to probably experience a few things that we've got to go look into, and we'll do that and we'll talk to you about them as time goes on.

The flight is a key test mission to demonstrate the spacecraft's abilities, but it has faced multiple delays since early May due to safety issues, including a helium leak in the propulsion system.\n\nTwo more leaks were discovered hours into the flight, disabling some of the thrusters used to steer the craft in space. Boeing and NASA have not confirmed the size of the new helium leaks.\n\nThe leaks do not pose safety concerns for the craft or its NASA test pilots, Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, according to Boeing spokesman Jim May. The capsule also has backup thrusters if needed.\n\nThe propellant in Starliner's thrusters is pressurized with helium, which is stored in two tanks aboard the capsule. NASA and Boeing did not indicate which thrusters were offline or the speed of the leak.\n\nThe crew and mission managers are monitoring the helium leaks while looking to dock with the ISS by midday on June 6.\n\nThe craft should have plenty of helium reserves to compensate for what it has lost, Mr. May said, adding that the capsule will no longer need the thrusters once it has completed docking.\n\nOnce Starliner has docked with the ISS, Mr. Wilmore and Ms. Williams will check for airlock leaks and pressurize the entryway between the craft and the space station before opening the hatches and greeting the seven crew members on the ISS.\n\nFour of them are U.S. astronauts, and three are Russian cosmonauts.\n\nBoeing and NASA plan to keep the two pilots aboard the ISS for roughly eight days before they reboard Starliner for the return flight home.\n\nThe intense blast through the Earth's atmosphere will end with a parachute slowly lowering Starliner to the desert sands of the U.S. Southwest before deploying airbags to cushion the bottom of the craft as it touches the ground.\n\nThis type of spacecraft reentry is a first for a crewed NASA mission. SpaceX's Dragon, by contrast, splashes into the ocean upon reentry.\n\nStarliner's successful June 5 launch comes after years of delays in getting the new craft to space. Boeing's first test launch in 2019 failed, prompting another non-crewed test launch in 2022 that finally reached the ISS.\n\nBoeing and NASA launched Starliner aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket, the first time astronauts have ridden one since NASA's Project Mercury in the 1960s. Astronaut John Glenn rode an Atlas V when he became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962.\n\nStarliner is the rocket's 100th successful launch in 60 years, as it is often used to take satellites to space. The United Launch Alliance is a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing.\n\nNASA and Boeing said in a press conference on May 31 that a bad seal likely caused the helium leak, allowing the gas to escape from the propulsion and thruster systems. Officials said it was not serious enough to require a full mechanical fix, pointing to the craft's additional helium reserves.\n\nStarliner was born out of contracts that NASA awarded to Boeing and SpaceX in 2014. Boeing received $4.2 billion to develop what would become Starliner, and SpaceX received $2.6 billion, which it used to create its Dragon spacecraft. Dragon employs a redesign of an existing craft that SpaceX had been using to send supplies to space.\n\nSince 2020, Dragon has been NASA's only vehicle for sending astronauts to orbit from the United States. Starliner's first test flight is key to earning NASA's approval for additional crew missions aboard the new spacecraft.\n\nDespite receiving billions from NASA, Boeing's Starliner is years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget.\n\nBoeing is also experiencing headaches with its airplane manufacturing business after incidents with its 737 MAX jets. The Federal Aviation Administration has capped Boeing's production of the fast-selling airplane until it reaches several safety and quality standards set by the regulatory body.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabin_pressurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabin pressurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propellant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Propellant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airlock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airlock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbag", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airbag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Glenn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Glenn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed Martin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/06/05/id5663186-Boeings-Starliner-AP24157561366693-1080x720.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 102, "textEnd": 108, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 260, "textEnd": 266, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 3067, "textEnd": 3073}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

NASA Administrator Bill Nelson expressed confidence in the mission, hailing it as a significant milestone in American space exploration.\n\nHe emphasized the daring nature of human spaceflight and its inherent value, highlighting the collective excitement surrounding NASA, its commercial partners, and the future of space exploration.\n\n\"It's an exciting time for NASA, our commercial partners, and the future of exploration. Go Starliner, Go Butch and Suni!\" Nelson said in a statement.\n\nThe flight test aims to validate various elements, including the transportation system, launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, in-orbit operations capabilities, and the safe return to Earth with astronauts onboard as a component of NASA's Commercial Crew Program.\n\nThis process is crucial as NASA works towards certifying Starliner for rotational missions to the space station. According to NASA, before this, Starliner had undergone two uncrewed orbital flights, one of which involved a test to and from the space station and a pad abort demonstration.\n\nRead Also: Two World's Firsts: Metal 3D Printer for Space, Surgical Robot Are Now on Their Way to ISS\n\nBoeing's Commercial Crew Program Vice President and Program Manager, Mark Nappi, affirmed the mission's progress, ensuring a safe and successful journey for the astronauts aboard.\n\nThroughout the flight, Boeing will closely track Starliner's every move from its mission control center in Houston, Texas. On the other hand, NASA teams will monitor space station operations from the Johnson Space Center's Mission Control Center, also in Houston.\n\nAccording to NASA, Starliner will autonomously link up with the forward-facing port of the station's Harmony module around 12:15 p.m. on Thursday, June 6, and stay connected to the orbital laboratory for at least a week.\n\nDuring the journey, Wilmore and Williams will be responsible for ensuring the spacecraft's proper operation. They will execute tests on various systems, including the environmental control system, displays, control system, thrusters, and many more.\n\nFollowing their safe arrival at the space station, the two new astronauts will join the Expedition 71 crew, which includes NASA astronauts Tracy C. Dyson, Michael Barratt, Jeanette Epps, and Matt Dominick and Roscosmos cosmonauts Oleg Kononenko, Nikolai Chub, and Alexander Grebenkin.\n\n\"For many of us, this is a career-defining moment bringing on a new crew transportation capability for our agency and our nation,\" said Steve Stich, the manager for Commercial Crew Program, at NASA's Johnson Space Center.\n\n\"We are going to take it one step at a time, putting Starliner through its paces, and remaining vigilant until Butch and Suni safely touch down back on Earth at the conclusion of this test flight,\" he added.", "source": {"uri":

Roughly half an hour after launch, Starliner fired its thrusters and reached a stable orbit -- achieving a long-awaited milestone for the program.\n\n\"You're seeing lots of happy faces and cheers,\" Brandi Dean, a public affairs officer at NASA, said on a live webcast. \"Everybody is glad to see Starliner is safely in orbit.\"\n\nThe drama-free launch provided some rare good news for Boeing, which has been grappling with a crisis centered on its marquee 737 Max jetliner.\n\nBoeing shares pared earlier losses and were up less than 1% at 1:20 p.m. in New York.\n\nStarliner will perform a series of maneuvers to put it on course to link up with the space station around 12:15 p.m. Florida time on Thursday for a roughly week-long stay.\n\nWednesday's test is the culmination of years of delays caused by technical glitches and failures with the Starliner craft. Those include an earlier botched 2019 test flight and fresh concerns over the past month of a still-unresolved helium leak NASA is monitoring throughout the mission.\n\nNASA is using the flight to prove Starliner can safely carry people to and from the ISS under the US space agency's Commercial Crew Program.\n\n\"Today, it all lined up,\" Boeing executive Mark Nappi told reporters after the morning launch, noting a \"perfect countdown and launch.\" But Nappi laid out several key milestones before the vehicle is certified for regular spaceflight. Those include docking and undocking at the orbiting research laboratory and the capsule's safe return to Earth.\n\nIn 2014, NASA awarded Boeing $4.2 billion and Elon Musk's SpaceX $2.6 billion to create vehicles to ferry the agency's astronauts to space. While Starliner has fallen seven years behind schedule, SpaceX has launched nine separate crews to the space station for NASA since 2020.\n\nWhile this test is largely focused on Starliner, it was also an important moment for ULA. The Atlas V rocket had 99 previous successful launches before it ever carried astronauts. Boeing is also one of two parent companies of ULA, along with rival Lockheed Martin Corp.\n\n\"We are very proud to join the human spaceflight community,\" ULA Chief Executive Officer Tory Bruno told reporters.\n\nBoeing and NASA first tried to launch on May 6, but the flight was halted hours before takeoff due to an oddly behaving pressure valve in the Atlas V rocket. Boeing further delayed the launch by a few weeks to investigate the helium leak.\n\nA June 1 attempt was called off less than four minutes before takeoff after a launch computer needed for the final stages of flight was slow to respond.\n\nDespite the earlier setbacks, the mission appeared to go off without a hitch. But NASA said it was keeping an eye on so-called sublimators used to cool the vehicle down during the flight. The components are running out of water a little more quickly than expected, but Starliner's radiators should be able to take over, mitigating the problem.\n\nAhead of Wednesday's launch, Wilmore noted the American flags he'd seen earlier that day, including on the Atlas V rocket itself.\n\n\"We think that represents unity and resilience and unified efforts for the common good,\" he said minutes before the launch. \"Suni and I are honored to share this dream of spaceflight with each and every one of you.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnbctv18.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It is scheduled at 12:15 p.m. ET (1615 GMT) to dock autonomously with the ISS, which orbits some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. It is due to stay docked for about eight days, then safely return the two astronauts to Earth, among other flight objectives.\n\nIts launch on Wednesday followed years of technical problems, various delays and a successful 2022 test mission to the orbital laboratory without astronauts aboard.\n\nBoeing intends for Starliner - seeded with NASA funding - to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been the U.S. space agency's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from U.S. soil. The mission is a test flight required before NASA can certify Starliner for routine astronaut missions.\n\nThe seven-seat Starliner's inaugural crew includes two veteran NASA astronauts in Wilmore, 61, a retired U.S. Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nGetting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its $4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA, which wants the redundancy of two different U.S. rides to the ISS. The Starliner is several years behind schedule and more than $1.5 billion over budget. Meanwhile, Boeing's commercial airplane operations have been rocked by crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners.\n\n(Reporting by Joey Roulette in Washington; Editing by Will Dunham)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The crew capsule launched atop United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket, carrying NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. This is the first time Starliner has had a crew on board; the test flight suffered from numerous delays and issues leading up to the launch.\n\nThe company was originally targeting May 6 for the liftoff of Starliner but a last minute anomaly with one of the Atlas V rocket pressure valves delayed the crewed test flight to May 17. Just days before the launch, however, Starliner teams detected a small helium leak in the spacecraft's service module, prompting them to push the launch to May 21 before it was delayed indefinitely.\n\nThe spacecraft consists of a reusable crew capsule and an expendable service module. Helium is used in the spacecraft's thruster systems to allow the thrusters to fire without being combustible or toxic.\n\nLast week, Boeing and NASA announced that they had decided to proceed with flying the crew on the leaky Starliner spacecraft without resolving the issue, arguing that it poses no risk to the safety of the astronauts. At the time, NASA seemed confident in its commercial partner's vehicle despite the leaky helium. \"We can handle this particular leak if that leak rate were to grow even up to 100 times,\" Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, said during a news conference at the time.\n\nStarliner is scheduled to dock with the ISS on Thursday at 12:15 p.m. ET, dropping off the crew at the space station. The capsule is meant to stay docked in low Earth orbit for about a week before transporting the crew back to Earth.

They then moved the Starliner so that its solar array pointed at the sun to show they could charge the internal batteries if ever needed, Boeing said in a statement.\n\nNext, they swung Starliner around and pointed the nose away from Earth to look at the stars. This was to show they could manually use the star trackers in the VESTA system to establish their attitude in space in case all three flight computers were to ever go out or be turned off at the same time.\n\nThen, they manually sped Starliner up and then slowed it down, which slightly raised and then lowered their orbit. This was to show that the crew could manually break away from the space station orbit during rendezvous, if necessary.\n\nFinally, the crew manually pointed Starliner in the orientation needed for entry into the Earth's atmosphere, just in case they had to do that manually. During that manoeuvre, they again pointed the solar array at the sun to try a different method of confirming they could manually charge the batteries.\n\nThere is more manual piloting to come for this \"pilot's spacecraft\" with Wilmore and Williams on docking day, June 6.\n\nThe Starliner spacecraft, dubbed Calypso, has been developed by Boeing, under a contract from NASA. It has run into several delays and glitches in its developmental process.\n\nMoments before lift-off, Commander Wilmore called out to thank all those who had worked to make the mission possible. Alluding to past difficulties, he said: \"When the going gets tough - and it often does - the tough get going, and you have.\" Starliner's pilot Suni Williams chimed in: \"Go 'Calypso'! (the name of the capsule). Take us to space and back.\" This mission is a critical venture for manufacturer Boeing, which has been under pressure after a series of safety incidents on its aeroplanes.\n\nStarliner, likewise, has encountered numerous technical issues that have delayed its planned crewed debut by almost a decade.\n\nThe most dramatic of these problems occurred on the capsule's first uncrewed test flight in 2019 when software errors forced the vehicle to abort its trip to the ISS. Nasa requested a second dummy run be conducted in 2022 to be sure the errors had been corrected.\n\nStarliner was developed in response to NASA's request for commercial options to get its astronauts into space.\n\nFollowing the retirement of the famous shuttles in 2011, the agency wanted to move away from owning and operating vehicles to an arrangement where it could simply purchase the service - just like a company might outsource its IT needs or payroll.\n\nThe new approach was designed to save NASA money it could then spend on ambitious plans to return people to the Moon.\n\nThe agency gave contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to help bring their capsules into service and then pay them for six operational missions. Whereas SpaceX was able to fly its crew flight test in 2020 and then complete six operational missions by March of this year, Boeing is still at the stage of the initial crew flight test.", "source": {"uri": "telegraphindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaic_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photovoltaic system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_tracker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star tracker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space rendezvous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_(radio)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antenna (radio)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere of Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://assets.telegraphindia.com/telegraph/2024/May/1714983569_sunita-williams.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 2223, "textEnd": 2229}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

About half an hour after launch, Starliner fired its thrusters and reached a stable orbit -- achieving a long-awaited milestone for the program.\n\n\"You're seeing lots of happy faces and cheers,\" NASA public affairs officer Brandi Dean said on a live Web cast. \"Everybody is glad to see Starliner is safely in orbit.\"\n\nThe drama-free launch provided some rare good news for Boeing, which has been grappling with a crisis centered on its marquee 737 MAX jetliner.\n\nBoeing shares pared earlier losses and were up less than 1 percent at 1:20pm in New York.\n\nStarliner would perform a series of maneuvers to put it on course to link up with the space station at about 12:15pm Florida time yesterday for a roughly week-long stay.\n\nWednesday's test is the culmination of years of delays caused by technical glitches and failures with the Starliner craft. Those include an earlier botched 2019 test flight and fresh concerns over the past month of a still-unresolved helium leak NASA is monitoring throughout the mission.\n\nAfter the craft arrived in orbit, teams identified two additional helium leaks, a NASA spokesperson said by e-mail.\n\nThe spacecraft is in a \"stable configuration\" as officials evaluate the data while monitoring the leaks, the spokesperson said.\n\nA Boeing spokesperson said the company is monitoring the situation, but it did not appear to be an issue for docking.\n\nNASA is using the flight to prove Starliner can safely carry people to and from the ISS under the US space agency's Commercial Crew Program.\n\n\"Today, it all lined up,\" Boeing executive Mark Nappi told reporters after the morning launch, noting a \"perfect countdown and launch.\"\n\nHowever, Nappi laid out several key milestones before the vehicle is certified for regular spaceflight. Those include docking and undocking at the orbiting research laboratory and the capsule's safe return to Earth.\n\nIn 2014, NASA awarded Boeing US$4.2 billion and Elon Musk's SpaceX US$2.6 billion to create vehicles to ferry the agency's astronauts to space. While Starliner has fallen seven years behind schedule, SpaceX has launched nine separate crews to the space station for NASA since 2020.\n\nWhile this test is largely focused on Starliner, it was also an important moment for ULA. The Atlas V rocket had 99 previous successful launches before it ever carried astronauts. Boeing is also one of two parent companies of ULA, along with rival Lockheed Martin Corp.\n\n\"We are very proud to join the human spaceflight community,\" ULA chief executive officer Tory Bruno told reporters.\n\nBoeing and NASA first tried to launch on May 6, but the flight was halted hours before takeoff due to an oddly behaving pressure valve in the Atlas V rocket. Boeing further delayed the launch by a few weeks to investigate the helium leak.\n\nA June 1 attempt was called off less than four minutes before takeoff after a launch computer needed for the final stages of flight was slow to respond.", "source": {"uri": "taipeitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Taipei Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_airliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jet airliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory_Bruno", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tory Bruno"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Takeoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://www.taipeitimes.com/images/2024/06/07/p05-240607-311.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 3380, "textEnd": 3385}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 3581, "textEnd": 3587}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

As it was for Starliner, this was also the first time astronauts have launched atop an Atlas V in its 22-year flight history.\n\nRelated: Boeing Starliner 1st astronaut flight: Live updates\n\n\"We all know that when the going gets tough, as it often does, the tough get going, and you all have,\" Wilmore said while waiting on the pad for liftoff. \"Let's get going, let's put some fire in this rocket. \"\n\n\"Let's go Calyspo, take us to space and back,\" pilot Sunita Williams said just minutes before launch, referring to the name of the Starliner capsule.\n\nStarliner is headed toward the International Space Station (ISS), where Wilmore and Williams will spend about eight days putting the spacecraft through a series of tests toward operational crew certification. Rendezvous is scheduled for Thursday (June 6) around 12:15 p.m. EDT (1615 GMT). You can follow the mission with our Starliner live updates page.\n\nThe fiery launch brings NASA within reach of a goal the agency set more than a decade ago: getting two American commercial vehicles up and running for astronaut missions to the ISS. It's been a long road to get here, as the roots of this goal go back to at least 2006.\n\nThe newly launched Starliner mission, a roughly 10-day jaunt known as Crew Flight Test (CFT), was originally scheduled to lift off on May 6. But that attempt was scrubbed about two hours before launch, when team members noticed a \"buzzing\" valve on the Atlas V's upper stage.\n\nULA decided to replace the valve, which required rolling the rocket off the pad and back to the company's vertical integration facility. That work delayed the planned liftoff until May 17, but then another issue arose: a slight helium leak in one of the reaction-control thrusters in Starliner's service module.\n\nThe mission team took more time to analyze the leak and its potential consequences, ultimately deeming it a minor issue and clearing CFT for a planned June 1 liftoff. \"Sometimes, for spaceflight, you plan for contingencies, and you design the vehicle to have margin,\" Steve Stich, NASA's Commercial Crew Program manager, said during a pre-launch press briefing on Friday (May 31).\n\n\"We have margin in the helium tank,\" he added. \"We could handle a leak that's 100 times worse than this. So [...] we concluded that the smartest thing to do was to go fly the mission, and we could fly it safely.\"\n\nThe June 1 attempt, however, was aborted just minutes before liftoff thanks to a failed power distribution source in the ground equipment. The mission team replaced the faulty gear, setting CFT up for its launch today.\n\nCFT aims to check out Starliner thoroughly ahead of certifying the spacecraft for longer missions. Williams and Wilmore will do some manual flying, test emergency scenarios like losing communications or power, and do a lot of debriefing to ensure that future Starliner crews know what to expect.\n\nIf all goes well on CFT, Starliner will carry its first astronaut crew for about six months to the ISS, perhaps as early as 2025. Starliner-1, that first operational flight, will carry NASA astronauts Mike Fincke and Scott Tingle along with Canadian Space Agency astronaut Josh Kutryk. The Starliner-1 crew is already deep in training, and Fincke served as backup for CFT as well.\n\nRelated: The ISS has a urine pump problem. Boeing's Starliner will flush it out.\n\nCommercial crew's genesis extends back to the commercial cargo program, which was first funded in 2006, as NASA used similar models to get private robotic and crewed vehicles running to the ISS. Until then, only government programs had sent supplies to the orbiting lab; agency officials turned to industry to nurture those companies' independence and resilience while, ideally, saving on taxpayer cost.\n\nCommercial cargo nurtured the development of SpaceX's cargo Dragon and Northrop Grumman's Cygnus vehicle, both of which have been flying robotic resupply missions to the ISS for more than a decade, and will soon send Sierra Space's Dream Chaser to space as well. The success of cargo development helped NASA award its first commercial crew contracts in 2010, collectively totaling $50 million (worth about $72 million in 2024 dollars) to five companies.\n\nThe quintet included Blue Origin, Boeing, Paragon Space Development Corp., Sierra Nevada (now Sierra Space) and ULA, each of which received support under CCDev-1 (Commercial Crew Development-1) for several human spaceflight technologies. ULA's funding helped certify the Atlas V for human missions.\n\nRelated: I flew Boeing's Starliner spacecraft in 4 different simulators. Here's what I learned (video, photos)\n\nBetween 2010 and 2014, several new rounds of commercial crew funding brought extra support to Boeing, SpaceX and a range of other companies. CCDev-2, announced in April 2011, awarded a total of $270 million to Blue Origin, Boeing, Sierra Nevada and SpaceX. (Boeing got $92 million in this round for Starliner, while SpaceX's $75 million went toward the development of Crew Dragon.)\n\nThe funding increased with Commercial Crew integrated Capability (CCiCap) in August 2012, as NASA also narrowed the field to three companies: Sierra Nevada received $212 million for Dream Chaser, while Boeing and SpaceX got $460 million and $440 million, respectively.\n\nSpaceX and Boeing then received the last major contract for final development work, known as Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap), in September 2014. Boeing's deal was worth $4.2 billion back then, while SpaceX got $2.6 billion. The money was also meant to cover six operational crewed flights to and from the ISS.\n\nAs is common with big spaceflight projects, lots of logistical and technical obstacles arose for both companies' spacecraft. NASA wanted the two CCtCap awardees to fly astronauts in 2017, but SpaceX's first such test flight launched in 2020, while Boeing's was delayed even longer, until today.\n\nLots of things contributed to the wait. Congress repeatedly gave less money than the White House and NASA requested for commercial crew, and technical obstacles arose. Boeing's solutions, however, took more flights and more time than SpaceX's.\n\nSpaceX has sent 12 crewed missions to the ISS to date, including the 63-day Demo-2 test flight with NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley in 2020. Their mission had been expected to launch in 2019, shortly after an uncrewed Crew Dragon successfully reached the ISS for the first time that March. But only a month later, that Dragon exploded during a ground test of its launch-abort system. SpaceX, as one would expect, put off human launches until it could address the mishap cause, which turned out to be a faulty valve.\n\nStarliner's issues were more complex. Its own first uncrewed mission, called Orbital Flight Test (OFT), never reached the ISS as planned in December 2019. The capsule's timing system got confused, and Starliner became stuck in an orbit that made it impossible to rendezvous with its destination. The investigation was complex and lengthy, requiring dozens of fixes, and the pandemic's arrival in early 2020 further delayed schedules due to supply chain problems and social distancing requirements.\n\nStarliner's next uncrewed flight met up with the ISS flawlessly in May 2022, but its road to crewed flights faced another obstacle in 2023. Late in CFT's training flow, new issues with the spacecraft were discovered, requiring extra fixes ahead of flight. The most pressing concerned the main parachutes (which carried less load than engineers thought) and the capsule wiring (which, as it turned out, was largely wrapped in flammable P213 tape).\n\nThe CFT astronauts, and Boeing and NASA, have repeatedly said these issues are behind them, although new issues could arise during CFT. Wilmore has also downplayed CFT as being the one thing determining Starliner's success; he frames all stages of development for astronauts as \"vitally important.\"\n\n\"This is human spaceflight,\" Wilmore explained to reporters in a livestreamed press conference on April 25, when he and Williams arrived at KSC for quarantine, training and launch preparations ahead of the May 6 attempt. \"You know that adage you've heard since Apollo 13: failure is not an option. And that has nothing specifically to do with Boeing or this program. That's all things that we do in human spaceflight.\"\n\nIn addition, a failure of a parachute to fully open during Blue Origin's recent NS-25 suborbital crewed launch prompted Boeing to double-check Starliner's own parachute systems.\n\n\"Starliner uses some similar components to [the New Shepard] parachute system,\" Stich explained during the May 31 briefing. According to Stich, Blue Origin provided NS-25 flight data with NASA, SpaceX and Boeing, allowing engineers to ensure the functionality of specific components. And, after examining the data, Stich said it was determined Starliner was \"good to go fly.\"\n\nRelated: 1st Boeing Starliner astronauts are ready to launch to the ISS for NASA (exclusive)\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\n-- NASA, Boeing hail Starliner space capsule launch success despite thruster glitch\n\n-- Boeing's Starliner crew capsule channels R2-D2 ahead of astronaut test flight\n\n-- NASA, Boeing delay Starliner capsule's 1st astronaut launch to early May\n\nWith the ISS expected to continue flying until at least 2030, the plan going forward is for three different spacecraft to carry astronauts to and from the orbiting lab. Aside from Dragon and Starliner, Russia will continue to send cosmonaut-led crews using its Soyuz spacecraft until at least 2028, when the nation's commitment to the partnership is scheduled to expire.\n\nSome NASA astronauts continue to use Soyuz for policy reasons, and also because the space station partners want as many backups as possible in case of technical problems with any one spacecraft.\n\nAs for private Starliner astronaut missions aside from NASA obligations for ISS, Boeing officials have said repeatedly that they want to focus on fulfilling their NASA contract first.\n\nIn the May 31 briefing, Fincke said that CFT \"will help continue the certification process for Starliner, so that Starliner 1, 2, 3, to infinity and beyond, can fly and provide services to the International Space Station, and it's up to Boeing, but other other missions available out there too.\"\n\nBesides that, CFT \"really is all of our attention at this point,\" Mark Nappi, Boeing's commercial crew program manager, told reporters on April 25. With at least six more years of ISS flights to plan for, \"we've got plenty of time to think about what's after that,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Development of the Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Nevada", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Nevada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Space", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Space"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner-1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner-1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fincke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Fincke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blue Origin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northrop Grumman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_D._Tingle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scott D.

Docking was initially targeted for 12:15 p.m. New York time. A second docking opportunity opens at 1:33 p.m.\n\nA handful of thrusters failed, but NASA was able to troubleshoot and bring most of them back online. The thrusters are tiny engines used to help maneuver Starliner through space.\n\nNASA said Boeing can proceed with docking during the next window.\n\nStarliner carried astronauts to space for the first time after launching on Wednesday on top of an Atlas V rocket operated by the United Launch Alliance LLC.\n\nThe trip, with NASA veteran fliers Sunita \"Suni\" Williams and Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore aboard, will evaluate whether the vehicle can safely transport people to and from space for NASA. Docking is a key milestone that Starliner needs to demonstrate during this test.\n\nBoeing was forced to perform two uncrewed test flights of Starliner after its first mission in 2019 failed to reach the ISS as planned. The company has also dealt with corroded valves, parachute issues, flammable tape and other issues. A last-minute helium leak pushed back this launch date by roughly a month. Those leaks have persisted and continue to be evaluated by NASA.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore aim to enter the space station and stay for about a week. During that time, they'll unload cargo and practice procedures that future astronauts will use when flying to the space station on Starliner for long-term stays.\n\nOnce finished, they'll load back into Starliner for the journey home, another critical test the spacecraft needs to ace for this mission. Starliner is meant to keep the astronauts safe while plunging through Earth's atmosphere. It will ultimately land in the southwestern US underneath parachutes.\n\nNASA will use the data from this flight to determine if Starliner is ready to regularly transport the agency's astronauts to and from the ISS for six-month-long stays. If approved, Boeing will share that responsibility with NASA's other commercial partner, SpaceX, which since 2020 has been taking crews to the space station on its Crew Dragon.\n\n(Updates with details on failed thrusters in third paragraph.)", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_and_berthing_of_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Docking and berthing of spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere of Earth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 80}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/img/tsn/logos/tsn-logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

After two previous attempts, the Starliner was launched at 10:52 a.m. local time Wednesday from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nThe earlier attempts to send U.S. astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams to the ISS on the first crewed flight of Starliner were canceled before launch.\n\nWilmore and Williams had just entered the capsule on May 6 when ground officials noted a faulty oxygen relief valve on the Atlas V rocket's second stage. The second scrub occurred last Saturday with just under four minutes before liftoff due to a failure involving the computer system that controls the countdown's final minutes.\n\n\"We don't launch until it's right,\" said NASA administrator Bill Nelson in a press conference.\n\nThe most recent launch lifted off successfully, but the sublimator system, which provides cooling during both the launch and the landing by creating a block of ice, is now being monitored.\n\n\"We used a little more water than we expected during the ascent,\" said Steve Stitch, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, during the press conference.\n\nNASA says a backup system is in place and that the sublimator will be monitored and tested.\n\nSince the initial launch, reaction has begun to trickle in, even from other space providers. Elon Musk of SpaceX took to the social media platform X to offer his congratulations.\n\nBoeing has spoken about its relationship with SpaceX.\n\n\"We don't see it as a competition. We've got two providers that are going up to the International Space Station,\" said Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of the Commercial Crew Program for Boeing. \"This is something that NASA has planned, and we've accomplished it.\"\n\nAt the same time, NASA commented on its relationship with other countries involved in space exploration, including China.\n\n\"They [space program of the People's Republic of China] have made lots of progress in the last 10 years. I would very much and have said this publicly many times for them to be more transparent, more open, less secretive. We need to cooperate on things,\" said Nelson.\n\nWith the launch under way, Wilmore and Williams are expected to spend a day in orbit before docking with the orbital outpost, where they will spend about a week testing the capsule and its subsystems.\n\nThe eventual flight will be the final test before NASA can certify Boeing to conduct routine missions to and from the space station for the agency.\n\nBoeing will become the second reliable option for human space flight along with Elon Musk's SpaceX Dragon capsule. SpaceX has been shuttling NASA astronauts to and from the ISS since 2020.\n\nThe Starliner program has experienced years of costly setbacks and delays.\n\nDuring a 2019 uncrewed test flight, the capsule was on an incorrect trajectory due to a software error and returned without reaching the ISS.\n\nAnother launch was postponed in 2021 because of a valve problem. An uncrewed capsule reached the ISS in May 2022. But the spacecraft has experienced several problems since then, including the discovery of flammable tape in the cabin and weak parachutes.\n\nThe astronauts now headed to the International Space Station are currently scheduled to dock on June 6. Individuals at the press conference are yet to hear from Wilmore and Williams but stated that information from the astronauts should be coming shortly.", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "GlobalSecurity.org"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_pike@globalsecurity.org", "name": "John Pike", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(phase_transition)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sublimation (phase transition)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrator_of_NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Administrator of NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin_NS-16", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blue Origin NS-16"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space exploration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 69}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 474, "textEnd": 479}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 3307, "textEnd": 3313}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

NASA was troubleshooting five of the jets that were not operating and was able to recover four of the malfunctioning jets after testing.\n\nThe spacecraft is making a second attempt at docking, scheduled for 1:33 p.m. ET, after NASA cleared Starliner to approach with 27 of the 28 jets operational.\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have been working with NASA's flight controllers to test fire the thrusters in an attempt to recover the spacecraft's full propulsion system.\n\nWilmore and Williams were told by NASA capsule communicator, or CAPCOM, Neal Nagata that the 12:15 p.m. docking attempt had to be called off due to the ISS' zero fault tolerance for a spacecraft control problem.\n\nCAPCOM Nagata had the astronauts hold the spacecraft beyond the \"keep out sphere,\" an invisible boundary around the ISS that serves as a safety measure, while diagnosing the problematic thrusters.\n\nBoeing's Starliner launched successfully on Wednesday to begin the crew flight test, marking the first time the capsule is carrying astronauts to space. The mission represents the final major step before NASA certifies Boeing to fly crew on operational missions.\n\nThe spacecraft was once seen as a competitor to SpaceX's Dragon. However, various setbacks and delays have steadily slipped Starliner into a backup position for NASA, with the agency planning to have the companies fly astronauts on alternating missions.", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_sheetz@cnbc.com", "name": "Michael Sheetz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_controller", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flight controller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_control_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reaction control system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_propulsion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft propulsion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107425251-1717693752316-boeing_starliner_iss_approach_1.png?v=1717693777&w=1920&h=1080", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

It is scheduled to dock with the International Space Station (ISS) at 18h15, South African time, on Thursday. It will remain docked with the ISS until at least June 14.\n\nThe Starliner has been developed under Nasa's Commercial Crew Programme (CCP), and the test flight is being executed by two Nasa astronauts. They are Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams. Both are veteran astronauts, both having flown two previous space missions. Both are pilots, and both are also engineers. Wilmore had previously accumulated 178 days in space, while Williams' total was 322 days. On this test flight, Wilmore is the mission commander and Williams is the pilot.\n\nUnder the CCP, Nasa selected two companies to build and launch spacecraft to carry astronauts into low Earth orbit (allowing Nasa to focus its attention on its Orion crewed deep space vessel). Boeing was one, and SpaceX was the other. But while SpaceX has been successfully flying CCP missions to the ISS since May 2020 (the date of its crewed test flight), and is now on its eighth operational mission to the space station, the Boeing programme has been plagued by failures and lesser glitches, causing delays that have run into years. The Starliner had, for example, to undertake two uncrewed test flights, because of failures on the first one, whereas Crew Dragon needed only a single uncrewed test flight.\n\n\"Two bold Nasa astronauts are well on their way in this historic first test flight of a brand-new spacecraft,\" highlighted Nasa administrator Bill Nelson. \"Boeing's Starliner marks a new chapter of American exploration. Human spaceflight is a daring task - but that's why it's worth doing. It's an exciting time for Nasa, our commercial partners, and the future of exploration. Go Starliner. Go Butch and Suni!\"\n\n\"This crew flight test represents the beginning of a new era of space exploration as we watch astronauts Wilmore and Williams put Boeing's Starliner through its paces on the way to the [ISS],\" affirmed Boeing Defence, Space and Security president and CEO Ted Colbert. \"This is a great start. We look forward to getting the astronauts safely to the space station and back home.\"\n\nThis successful launch of the spacecraft followed two previous attempts that both had to be scrubbed. In addition to its crew, the Starliner is carrying 345 kg of cargo to the ISS.\n\nThe Starliner was launched from Space Launch Complex-41 at the Cape Canaveral (US) Space Force Station, in the US State of Florida, on a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket. The Atlas V is composed of a Common Core Booster first stage and a Centaur second stage. This launch was also a first for ULA, as it was the maiden launch of a crewed mission by one of their rockets.", "source": {"uri": "engineeringnews.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Engineering News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_campbell@engineeringnews.co.za", "name": "Rebecca Campbell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space exploration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orion (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low Earth orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outer space"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Space Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_(rocket_stage)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centaur (rocket stage)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://cdn.creamermedia.com/assets/articles/images/resized/0001136152_resized_nasaboeingstarliner1stcrewedlaunch0620241022.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 403, "textEnd": 410}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-", "textStart": 1218, "textEnd": 1226}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Roughly half an hour after launch, Starliner fired its thrusters and reached a stable orbit -- achieving a long-awaited milestone for the programme.\n\n\"You're seeing lots of happy faces and cheers,\" Brandi Dean, a public affairs officer at NASA, said on a live webcast. \"Everybody is glad to see Starliner is safely in orbit.\"\n\nThe drama-free launch provided some rare good news for Boeing, which has been grappling with a crisis centred on its marquee 737 Max jetliner.\n\nBoeing shares pared earlier losses and were up less than 1% at 1.20pm in New York.\n\nStarliner will perform a series of manoeuvres to put it on course to link up with the space station around 12.15pm Florida time on Thursday for a roughly week-long stay.\n\nWednesday's test is the culmination of years of delays caused by technical glitches and failures with the Starliner craft. Those include an earlier botched 2019 test flight and fresh concerns over the past month of a still-unresolved helium leak NASA is monitoring throughout the mission.\n\nAfter the craft arrived in orbit, teams identified two additional helium leaks, a NASA spokesperson said by email. The spacecraft is in a \"stable configuration\" as officials evaluate the data while monitoring the leaks, the spokesperson said.\n\nA Boeing spokesperson said the company is monitoring the situation but it didn't appear to be an issue for docking.\n\nNASA is using the flight to prove Starliner can safely carry people to and from the ISS under the US space agency's Commercial Crew Programme.\n\n\"Today, it all lined up,\" Boeing executive Mark Nappi told reporters after the morning launch, noting a \"perfect countdown and launch.\" But Nappi laid out several key milestones before the vehicle is certified for regular spaceflight. Those include docking and undocking at the orbiting research laboratory and the capsule's safe return to Earth.\n\nIn 2014, NASA awarded Boeing $4.2-billion and Elon Musk's SpaceX $2.6-billion to create vehicles to ferry the agency's astronauts to space. While Starliner has fallen seven years behind schedule, SpaceX has launched nine separate crews to the space station for NASA since 2020.\n\nRead More: Boeing Starliner's Mounting Delays Carry Extra Sting\n\nWhile this test is largely focused on Starliner, it was also an important moment for ULA. The Atlas V rocket had 99 previous successful launches before it ever carried astronauts. Boeing is also one of two parent companies of ULA, along with rival Lockheed Martin Corp.\n\n\"We are very proud to join the human spaceflight community,\" ULA Chief Executive Officer Tory Bruno told reporters.\n\nBoeing and NASA first tried to launch on May 6, but the flight was halted hours before takeoff due to an oddly behaving pressure valve in the Atlas V rocket. Boeing further delayed the launch by a few weeks to investigate the helium leak.\n\nA 1 June attempt was called off less than four minutes before takeoff after a launch computer needed for the final stages of flight was slow to respond.\n\nDespite the earlier setbacks, the mission appeared to go off without a hitch. But NASA said it was keeping an eye on so-called sublimators used to cool the vehicle down during the flight. The components are running out of water a little more quickly than expected, but Starliner's radiators should be able to take over, mitigating the problem.\n\nAhead of Wednesday's launch, Wilmore noted the American flags he'd seen earlier that day, including on the Atlas V rocket itself.\n\n\"We think that represents unity and resilience and unified efforts for the common good,\" he said minutes before the launch. \"Suni and I are honoured to share this dream of spaceflight with each and every one of you.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymaverick.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily

Photo", "body": "The Boeing Starliner space capsule has lifted off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on the third attempt and after long delays. The crew consists of two NASA astronauts.\n\nThe capsule reached orbit in about twelve minutes. For the next 25 hours, NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will stay there until the Starliner autonomously docks to the front port of the station's Harmony module at noon on June 6, and will remain in the orbiting laboratory for about a week, NPR writes.\n\nThis mission marks the first time a commercially built capsule has carried humans and is scheduled to dock with a station. This was the third attempt to launch the Starliner. On Saturday, the countdown was stopped with less than four minutes left. It was caused by a problem with the onboard computers that control the launch. ULA's launch supplier replaced the power supply in the system and cleared it for launch on Wednesday. The previous launch attempt was last month - it was canceled due to a malfunctioning valve on the upper stage of the Atlas V Centaur rocket.\n\nWhile fixing this problem, Boeing discovered another one: a helium leak. The gas is used in the Starliner's propulsion system. After reviewing the data, NASA was confident that Boeing would be able to successfully complete the mission.\n\nHowever, during the flight, the helium leak occurred again. The astronauts manually closed the valves, and now experts are trying to find the source of the leak. Without helium, the spacecraft will not be able to perform rendezvous and docking maneuvers, as well as to deorbits - it is used to supercharge the propulsion system tanks, the alphacentaurichannel telegram channel writes.\n\nBut we hope that this third attempt will really succeed. Now that Wilmore and Williams have launched the Starliner, it is going on its maiden flight, testing it on the eve of operational missions for NASA.\n\n\"Two brave NASA astronauts are on their way to this historic first test flight of a brand new spacecraft. The Boeing Starliner marks a new chapter in American exploration. Human spaceflight is a daunting task, but that's exactly why it's worth it. This is an exciting time for NASA, our commercial partners, and the future of exploration,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson.\n\nWillmore and Williams will test key Starliner systems as it docks with the space station, including life support and communications. While the spacecraft can essentially fly itself, the duo will test manual control of the vehicle as it approaches the orbital outpost.\n\nThe crew will spend about a week aboard the station, with a planned parachute canopy landing in the southwestern United States. NASA and Boeing teams will analyze the data from this flight before certifying the vehicle for operations.", "source": {"uri": "eng.obozrevatel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Obozrevatel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony_(ISS_module)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harmony (ISS module)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space rendezvous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multistage rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_(rocket_stage)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centaur (rocket stage)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrator_of_NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Administrator of NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiden_flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maiden flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Data_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Data Centers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://i2.obozrevatel.com/news/2024/6/6/nasa.jpg?size=2010x1050", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 419, "textEnd": 425}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

It should be noted that she had contributed to the spacecraft's design during the previous ten years. As Ms. Williams traveled to space, she passed above India.\n\nAt 8:22 p.m. (IST) on an Atlas 5 rocket, she launched aboard Boeing's Starliner spaceship from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at Florida's Space Launch Complex-41. It's her third trip into space.\n\nOn the third try, there was a nominal lift-off. A day later, the Starliner will dock with the International Space Station after achieving the proper orbit. The International Space Station, the SpaceX Crew Dragon, and the Boeing Starliner are the three crewed spacecraft that the US currently has in orbit at the same time.\n\nIf everything goes according to plan, NASA says the Starliner will dock to the Harmony module of the station's forward-facing port, and Ms. Williams and her fellow passenger Butch Wilmore will stay for approximately a week to test the spacecraft and its subsystems before NASA works to finish the transportation system's final certification for rotational missions to the orbiting laboratory as part of its Commercial Crew Program.\n\nThe Starliner is the most advanced crew module yet to fly, according to NASA, and was created for astronauts by astronauts.\n\nWilliams, a space travel poster child for female aspirants, soared to the heavens in a brand-new spaceship.\n\nPrior to being surpassed by Peggy Whitson, the astronaut of Indian descent had been in space for 322 days and had set a record for the most hours that a woman had spent on a spacewalk.\n\nThis time, she creates history by becoming the first female pilot on a newly developed space shuttle's first crewed voyage.\n\nWhile the 59-year-old acknowledged that she was a little anxious, she insisted that she was not anxious about taking to the skies in a new spacecraft that she co-designed with Boeing and NASA experts.\n\nThis almost ten-day voyage will assist in demonstrating the Starliner's spaceworthiness. Additionally, it would demonstrate the team's preparedness to obtain a NASA certification and conduct extended missions on behalf of the US space agency.\n\nSome speculate that Boeing's space business may be affected by the issues ailing its aviation division, given that the Starliner project is far behind schedule and significantly over budget.\n\nTen years after NASA awarded a $4.2 billion contract to build it from the ground up in 2014, not a single successful human space flight has occurred. On the other hand, Space X, which had a comparable contract to create Crew Dragon, completed the project for an estimated cost of $2.6 billion. astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) already use SpaceX its crew module.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Launch_Complex_41", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Whitson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peggy Whitson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony_(ISS_module)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harmony (ISS module)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extravehicular activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 44}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/06/Sunita-Williams-Boeing-Starliner-Boeing-2024-06-b354d71a9c629aa01941904373abe3a1.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

And Suni and I are honored to share this dream of spaceflight with each and every one of you. So with that, let's get going! Let's put some fire in this rocket and push it toward the heavens!\"\n\nHe got his wish.\n\nThe Atlas 5 dropped the Starliner off with a velocity just shy of what's required to reach orbit, a precaution to make sure the crew ship would re-enter and land safely even if a major problem knocked out its own propulsion system. But there were no problems, and a thruster firing 31 minutes after liftoff completed the ascent phase of the mission, putting the ship in the planned orbit.\n\nThe astronauts then spent the afternoon testing the Starliner's manual controls and overall operation before taking a moment to congratulate Boeing, United Launch Alliance and NASA for a problem-free climb to space. Wilmore could barely contain his enthusiasm.\n\n\"It is just an amazing, amazing spacecraft,\" he said of the Starliner. \"Boeing's done a magnificent job. And thus far, like I said, things have just gone swimmingly, it's gone fabulously, put it like that. And so kudos to everybody. ULA? Love ya. Boeing? Love ya...It's been wonderful.\"\n\nThe Starliner's automated 25-hour rendezvous with the space station will wrap up Thursday as the ship approaches the lab from behind and below before moving in for docking just past 12 p.m. EDT at the Harmony module's forward port.\n\nThe long-awaited flight marked the first launch of an Atlas 5 with astronauts aboard and the first for the Atlas family of rockets since astronaut Gordon Cooper took off just a few miles away on the Mercury program's final flight 61 years ago.\n\nIt also marks the first piloted flight of the Starliner, Boeing's answer to SpaceX's Crew Dragon, an already operational, less expensive spacecraft that has carried 50 astronauts, cosmonauts and civilians into orbit in 13 flights, 12 of them to the space station, since an initial piloted test flight in May 2020.\n\nDespite a larger NASA contract, Boeing's Starliner is four years behind SpaceX getting astronauts to space. But Wilmore and Williams say the spacecraft is now safer and more capable thanks to numerous upgrades and fixes.\n\n\"I'm not going to say it's been easy. It's a little bit of (an) emotional roller coaster,\" Williams said before the crew's first launch attempt. But, she added, \"we knew we would get here eventually. It's a solid spacecraft. I don't think I would really want to be in any other place right now.\"\n\nWhile Wilmore and Williams are closing in on the space station Thursday, SpaceX plans to launch its gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship rocket on its fourth test flight from the company's Boca Chica, Texas, \"Starbase\" facility.\n\nThe booster will attempt a controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico shortly after liftoff while the Starship upper stage continues into space, looping halfway around the planet before re-entry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean.\n\nIn three previous flights, both stages were destroyed in flight, but performance dramatically improved with each launch as upgrades and fixes were implemented, and SpaceX expects more of the same with the fourth test flight.\n\nThe Super Heavy has nothing to do with Boeing's Starliner or the space station, but NASA will be paying close attention because the agency plans to use a variant of the Starship to carry astronauts down to the moon's surface in its Artemis program. Perfecting the Super Heavy booster and Starship upper stage are crucial to those plans.\n\nWilmore and Williams plan to dock at the space station and be welcomed aboard by cosmonauts Oleg Kononenko, Nikolai Chub and Alexander Grebenkin, along with NASA's Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt, Jeanette Epps and Tracy Dyson.\n\nKononenko logged his 1,000th day in space across five flights Tuesday, underscoring his title as the world's most experienced spaceman, 220 days beyond the previous mark of 879 days set by cosmonaut Gennady Padalka in 2015.\n\nThe Starliner is tentatively scheduled to undock and return to Earth on June 14, but the flight could be extended depending on the weather at desert landing sites in the western United States.\n\nIf the Starliner test flight goes well, NASA managers plan to certify the spacecraft for routine crew rotation flights, launching one Crew Dragon and one Starliner each year to deliver long-duration crew members to the station for six-month tours of duty.\n\nNASA funded development of Crew Dragon and Boeing's Starliner to end the agency's sole post-shuttle reliance on Russian Soyuz for flights to the space station. Two spacecraft from different vendors were ordered to ensure the agency would be able to launch crews to the outpost even if one company's ferry ship was grounded for any reason.\n\nBoeing initially planned to launch the Starliner on its first piloted flight in 2020, but the spacecraft encountered multiple problems during an initial unpiloted launch in December 2019. The company fixed those issues and opted to launch a second uncrewed flight at its own expense but then ran into problems with corroded propulsion system valves.\n\nA second, successful uncrewed test flight was finally launched in May 2022. But after the spacecraft returned to Earth, engineers discovered protective tape wrapped around electrical lines inside the ship could pose a fire risk. Then they found possible problems with parachute harness connectors. When all was said and done, the first piloted flight was pushed into 2023.\n\nWilmore and Williams first strapped in for launch on May 6 only to be grounded by trouble with a pressure-relief valve in the Atlas 5's Centaur upper stage.\n\nA more vexing problem then cropped up: a small-but-persistent helium leak in the Starliner's propulsion system that affected one of 24 low-power maneuvering thrusters in the capsule's service module. Mission managers ultimately decided to launch the spacecraft as is, concluding the leak did not pose any credible safety risk.\n\nLaunch was rescheduled for June 1, but crew's second countdown stopped at the T-minus three-minute and 50-second mark when one of ULA's ground launch sequencer computers, one of three networked systems controlling the final moments of the countdown, failed to run in synch with its counterparts.\n\nThe problem was traced to a faulty power supply. Work to install and test replacement hardware delayed the Starliner's third launch attempt to Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [],

Docking was initially targeted for 12:15 p.m. New York time. A second docking opportunity opens at 1:33 p.m.\n\nA handful of thrusters failed, but NASA was able to troubleshoot and bring most of them back online. The thrusters are tiny engines used to help maneuver Starliner through space.\n\nNASA said Boeing can proceed with docking during the next window.\n\nStarliner carried astronauts to space for the first time after launching on Wednesday on top of an Atlas V rocket operated by the United Launch Alliance LLC.\n\nThe trip, with NASA veteran fliers Sunita \"Suni\" Williams and Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore aboard, will evaluate whether the vehicle can safely transport people to and from space for NASA. Docking is a key milestone that Starliner needs to demonstrate during this test.\n\nBoeing was forced to perform two uncrewed test flights of Starliner after its first mission in 2019 failed to reach the ISS as planned. The company has also dealt with corroded valves, parachute issues, flammable tape and other issues. A last-minute helium leak pushed back this launch date by roughly a month. Those leaks have persisted and continue to be evaluated by NASA.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore aim to enter the space station and stay for about a week. During that time, they'll unload cargo and practice procedures that future astronauts will use when flying to the space station on Starliner for long-term stays.\n\nOnce finished, they'll load back into Starliner for the journey home, another critical test the spacecraft needs to ace for this mission. Starliner is meant to keep the astronauts safe while plunging through Earth's atmosphere. It will ultimately land in the southwestern US underneath parachutes.\n\nNASA will use the data from this flight to determine if Starliner is ready to regularly transport the agency's astronauts to and from the ISS for six-month-long stays. If approved, Boeing will share that responsibility with NASA's other commercial partner, SpaceX, which since 2020 has been taking crews to the space station on its Crew Dragon.\n\n(Updates with details on failed thrusters in third paragraph.)\n\nYou are on Mint!

The Centaur will continue to help propel Starliner to a suborbit before the spacecraft boosts itself to orbit, bringing it closer to the International Space Station.\n\nThe crew flight test mission makes history in many ways. As the first crewed launch of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, Williams is the first female astronaut to fly on the first flight of a crewed spacecraft. The launch also marks the first crewed launch on the ULA Atlas V rocket and the first crewed launch on an Atlas-family class rocket since Gordon Cooper on the last Mercury program flight aboard \"Faith 7\" in May 1963.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com", "source": {"uri": "rttnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTTNews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_(rocket_stage)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centaur (rocket stage)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury-Atlas_9", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mercury-Atlas 9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mercury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Project Mercury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://cdn.rttnews.com/articleimages/ustopstories/2024/june/flighttest-jun6-lt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Various tests were able to recover all but one thruster, and mission managers gave the go-ahead to proceed with docking.The Starliner capsule is designed to dock autonomously with the space station, but Wilmore and Williams can take manual control if needed.Boeing's Starliner spacecraft is more than 24 hours into its long-awaited inaugural crewed test flight to the space station. The capsule lifted off atop an Atlas V rocket Wednesday from Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.The test flight is designed to demonstrate that the capsule can safely ferry NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station. If successful, NASA could authorize Boeing to conduct regular flights to the space station for the agency.This is a developing story.

They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\n\"Let's get going!\" Wilmore called out a few minutes before liftoff.\n\nHalf an hour later, he and Williams were safely in orbit and giving chase to the space station.

After all the trouble leading up to Wednesday's launch, including two scrapped countdowns, everything went smoothly before and during liftoff, prompting congratulations from SpaceX's Elon Musk and others.\n\n\"Today it all lined up,\" said Boeing program manager Mark Nappi.\n\nYears late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner's crew debut comes as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane side.\n\nWilmore and Williams - retired Navy captains and former space station residents - stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full confidence in Boeing's ability to get it right with this test flight.\n\nCrippled by bad software, Starliner's initial test flight in 2019 without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend.

They will do various non-normal operations of the spacecraft during different parts of the mission to make sure that if future crews need to take over manual control of Starliner, the spacecraft can handle it.\n\nNASA's coverage of the docking can be found almost anywhere, all social media pages, on your TV, and on YouTube.", "source": {"uri": "spaceexplored.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Space Explored"}, "authors": [{"uri": "seth_kurkowski@spaceexplored.com", "name": "Seth Kurkowski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin_NS-16", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blue Origin NS-16"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakedown_cruise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shakedown cruise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/spaceexplored.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2022/05/Boeing-Starliner-ISS.jpeg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

That mission was a partial failure as it was not able to rendezvous with the ISS forcing a 2.5-year delay to Boeing's program to remedy hardware, software and management issues.\n\nThe second uncrewed test flight in 2022 made it to the ISS, but post-launch review and preparation for the CFT brought further delays with more hardware issues popping up.\n\nBut half a decade later, Williams and Wilmore were set to fly, entering quarantine on April 22. Finally, on May 6, they tried for the first time to take off from the Space Coast, but an issue with a fluttering valve on ULA's upper Centaur stage scrubbed that attempt with about two hours to go on the countdown clock. Then a second attempt this past Saturday was scrubbed within four minutes of launch because of ULA computers not synching at the launch pad.\n\n\"I am very impressed with my colleagues for being such optimists and such professionals.\" said NASA astronaut for future Starliner crew member Mike Fincke during NASA's live commentary leading up to launch.\n\n\"They've been in quarantine for a long time. You know we've been waiting for over five years to get Starliner launched, but they are very, very excited about today. You can see that they're focused on getting the job done and they are very ready for this mission.\"\n\nThe duo began suiting up before 6 a.m. at KSC's Neil Armstrong Operations & Checkout Building venturing out after 7:30 a.m. to climb aboard the updated Starliner-themed Airstream Astrovan for the ride over to neighboring Cape Canaveral and make their way back on board the Starliner spacecraft.\n\nBefore driving over, they played a traditional prelaunch game with chief of the astronaut office, Joe Acaba, not leaving until they had lost to Acaba -- this time in a quick game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The idea is that losing that game is the worst thing that happens on a launch day.\n\n\"Speaking as a child of the 70s, a lot of us watched \"Mr. Rogers Neighborhood\" and Mr. Rogers would tell us to take our time to do it right, and that's what we're doing here,\" Fincke said.\n\nJust before 9 a.m., teams waited for the conclusion of a weather brief before moving forward with hatch closure, but were given the go for hatch closure with less than two hours to go before launch.\n\n\"We are ready. We're smiling out here, see you in a couple weeks,\" said Wilmore.\n\nIf they manage to lift off, the astronauts will spend just over 25 hours making their way to the ISS where they will spend about eight days on board before returning to Earth for a landing in one of five locations in the desert in the southwestern United States.\n\n\"Today is a great day to put on a spacesuit and climb into a spacecraft and go launch,\" Fincke said.\n\nIf successful, this will be the final required mission for Boeing under NASA's Commercial Crew Program to achieve certification and set up regular rotational missions to the ISS, sharing duties with SpaceX.\n\n\"We need that access,\" said NASA Associate Administrator Jim Free. \"So right now, we have one provider giving us that access to the space station. This will give us a second provider, which means if we have a problem with either, we have ways to get our crews to and from station, which helps keep the tempo that we've had for 23 years of having humans in low-Earth orbit, but also that opportunity to get the crews back if there's an issue at all and keep that presence going.\"\n\nWilmore and Williams will spend time on both the way up and down from the ISS testing out manual control overrides among other facets of the mostly automated spacecraft.\n\n\"There's a thought of how things should be, but then there's the reality of how things need to be,\" said Wilmore ahead of the launch attempt. \"That's what this test is all -- everything we do is test. It's been a process over the years that is such a benefit in all aspects of the capabilities of this spacecraft, and we're excited to be a part of it.\"\n\nThe pair are former Navy test pilots and veterans of two spaceflight each, with both having traveled on board Russia Soyuz capsules as well as the space shuttle. Wilmore is commander and joined NASA's astronaut corps in 2000 while Williams joined in 1998.\n\nWilliams was given the honor to name the capsule after it landed, and dubbed it Calypso, in deference to oceanographer Jacques Cousteau's famed vessel. The zero-gravity indicator for the mission follows the maritime theme, a stuffed narwhal that is also named Calypso.\n\nThe flight comes just over four years since SpaceX made its first crewed flight to the ISS with its Crew Dragon spacecraft, which has since flown 13 times carrying 50 humans to space. That includes the four members of Crew-8 awaiting along with the rest of the seven-person crew of Expedition 71 aboard the ISS.\n\nISS crew members Jeanette Epps and Tracy Dyson recorded a message for Williams and Wilmore ahead of their last attempt to launch this past Saturday.\n\n\"We can't wait for you guys to join us here on station,\" Dyson said. \"We'll be monitoring your every move on the journey and we'll be waiting to open the hatch and welcome you to your home away from home.\"\n\n\"We know you've waited a while to get your ride aboard Starliner, but we know it will have been worth every minute,\" Epps added. \"So from all of us on the International Space Station, godspeed and we'll see you soon.\"\n\nStarliner is only the sixth ever U.S.-based spacecraft to fly with NASA astronauts following Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, the space shuttle and SpaceX's Crew Dragon. Williams is the first woman to fly on an orbital test flight among NASA's spacecraft.\n\nIt also marks a return of human launches from Cape Canaveral's launch pads, which last saw a crewed flight in 1968 with the launch of Apollo7. Every Apollo mission afterward as well as the space shuttle and Crew Dragon launches have come from nearby Kennedy Space Center.\n\nIt's the first time an Atlas V will fly with humans as well, although earlier iterations of the Atlas rocket flew several human spaceflights in the early 1960s, including John Glenn's historic trip to space as the first American to each orbit in 1962. This also marks the 100th launch of an Atlas V rocket.\n\nStarliner will also become the first U.S.-based capsule to make a land touchdown as Crew Dragon, Apollo, Gemini and Mercury all made waterlandings, as will the Artemis program's Orion capsule that has yet to fly with humans. Russia's Soyuz, though, features land touchdowns.\n\n2024 Orlando Sentinel.

At 10:52 am EDT, the capsule carrying astronauts Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams lifted off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station atop an Atlas V rocket.\n\nAfter 14 years of cost overruns, delays, ongoing technical problems, an embarrassing first uncrewed flight and a string of last minute launch scrubs, Boeing's Starliner is finally on its way to the International Space Station (ISS) with its crew of two NASA astronauts aboard.\n\nUnder clear skies, the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket lifted off from Space Launch Complex-41 (SLC-41) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida during an \"instant\" launch window. The vehicle reached the state of maximum dynamic pressure six seconds into the flight and went supersonic just after the one-minute mark. The Atlas booster shut down at two minutes, 20 seconds into the flight followed by the Centaur second stage firing its engine 10 seconds after separation occurred at four minutes, 28 seconds.\n\nAbout five minutes into the mission, the Centaur shut its engine down. About 11 minutes after liftoff, the Starliner separated from the second stage as it went into orbit at an altitude between 116 and 137 miles (187 and 222 km) and an inclination of 51.62\u00ba.\n\nAccording to Boeing, the astronauts have removed their spacesuits and are conducting a series of flight tests. These include practicing using the stars to orient the craft in the event of an emergency, manually flying the capsule without autonomous control, and pointing the solar panels at the Sun to generate power.\n\nStarliner is expected to dock with the space station tomorrow, when the crew will deliver 760 lb (345 kg) of supplies and spend a week aboard before returning to Earth. If the mission is successful, the next step will be certification of the spacecraft for long-duration missions.\n\n\"This crew flight test represents the beginning of a new era of space exploration as we watch astronauts Wilmore and Williams put Boeing's Starliner through its paces on the way to the International Space Station,\" said Boeing Defense, Space & Security President and CEO Ted Colbert. \"This is a great start.

Between the abbreviated debut mission and CFT, Boeing found and resolved issues with Starliner communications systems, software, oxidizer valves, parachutes and potentially flammable tape that was wrapped on wire harnesses throughout the spacecraft.\n\nULA tried on May 6 to launch the CFT mission, but the countdown was called off 2 hr. before liftoff due to a problem with a pressurization valve in the liquid oxygen tank on the Atlas' Centaur upper stage. Boeing and NASA also found and addressed a Starliner propulsion system design issue that could eliminate one of the backup procedures for conducting the spacecraft's critical deorbit burn at the end of the mission.\n\nAfter developing, testing and approving an additional deorbit burn procedure, ULA was cleared for a second launch attempt on June 1. That ended 3 min. 50 sec. before liftoff due to a failed ground power unit that affected one of three redundant launch sequencer systems that control the final 4 min. of the countdown.\n\nThe third launch attempt on June 5 sealed the deal. The Atlas V soared off its seaside launchpad at 10:52 a.m. and headed into a suborbital trajectory ranging 45-113 mi. above Earth and inclined 51.6 deg. relative to the equator. The first stage, powered by a Russian RD-180 engine, burned out and separated as planned 11 min. 52 sec. after liftoff, leaving a dual-engine Centaur to finish ULA's first human spaceflight.\n\n\"We're very proud to join this human spaceflight community,\" ULA CEO Tory Bruno told reporters after launch. \"There is absolutely nothing like this.\"\n\nThe Centaur fired for 7 min. 10 sec. and then released Starliner 14 min. 55 sec. after liftoff, setting the stage for the spacecraft to fire four of its orbital maneuvering and attitude control thrusters to put itself into orbit.\n\nDuring its 26-hr. approach to the ISS, Wilmore and Williams will test Starliner's manual flight control system ahead of an automated docking at the Harmony module's forward-facing port planned for 12:15 p.m. EDT June 6.\n\nAs the astronauts were preparing for sleep, flight controllers noticed a small but ongoing helium leak in Starliner's propulsion system -- discovered after the first launch scrub -- had increased, and two more leaks appeared as well. The crew were told to close the affected valves, which sidelined six of the spacecraft's 28 reaction control system thrusters. There was no immediate impact on the mission. The leaks will continue to be assessed overnight, NASA said.\n\n\"This was not unexpected,\" said Brandon Burroughs, a Boeing engineer and mission commentator. \"The helium system remains safe for flight. We plan for cases like this.\"\n\nWilmore and Williams plan to spend about a week aboard the station. During their stay, the crew will power down the spacecraft and test its ability to serve as a lifeboat for ISS crews. The final milestones of the CFT will be Starliner's departure from the ISS, deorbit burn, parachute descent and airbag-assisted landing in the U.S. Southwest. The earliest landing opportunity is targeted for 9:38 a.m. June 14 at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.\n\nWith Starliner having been developed under a fixed-price, milestone-based partnership agreement with NASA, Boeing shouldered most of the costs to fix its technical issues, which added years of delays and about $1.4 billion to the company's tab.\n\nNASA selected SpaceX and Boeing in 2014 to develop, test and operate separate commercial transportation systems to and from low Earth orbit. SpaceX completed its flight tests in 2020 and is in the midst of its eighth NASA crewed mission to the ISS. It is also preparing to launch its fifth private Crew Dragon charter this summer.\n\nLong-term, Boeing is eyeing orbital flight services beyond NASA as well, but not until it completes Starliner certification and begins the first of up to six operational missions for the agency under its 2014 Commercial Crew Transportation Capability contract, worth $4.45 billion as of March 31.\n\n\"We've been very focused on CFT,\" said Mark Nappi, Boeing vice president and Starliner program manager. \"We cheer for SpaceX -- that's something that is very important to our country and very important to NASA to have that access, and we're looking forward to providing that as well. We would have liked to have been further along at this time -- there's no doubt about that -- but we're here now and we're prepared.\n\n\"The private astronaut missions are of interest later in the decade,\" he added. \"Right now, the focus is on getting CFT flown safely, getting certified and then flying the Starliner-1 mission.\"\n\nPending the outcome of CFT, Boeing is looking to complete certification and have another Starliner spacecraft ready to fly in about six months. NASA plans to alternate ISS crew-rotation missions between SpaceX and Boeing, with Starliner-1 targeted to launch in spring 2025.\n\n\"Starliner flies beautifully in the simulator,\" Steve Stich, NASA Commercial Crew program manager, said before launch. \"I expect it'll do the same on orbit.\"\n\nAdded Nappi, \"There are a lot of phases to this mission and we just completed the first one.\"",

Docking manoeuvres with crew will pose another test for Starliner, followed roughly a week later by the test of returning to Earth.\n\nBoeing intends for Starliner to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been Nasa's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from US soil.\n\nLast-minute issues had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before lift-off over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before lift-off because of a glitch with a launchpad computer.\n\nOn June 5, the Atlas V's engines thundered to life in flaming clouds of exhaust and coolant-water vapour as the spacecraft roared off its launch pad into the sky from Florida's Atlantic Coast.\n\nThe Atlas V upper stage separated from the rocket's lower section about four minutes into flight, followed by Starliner's separation from the second stage. Now on its own in space, Starliner will ascend deeper into space and fire its onboard thrusters to plug itself into orbit and kick off its 24-hour catch-up with the ISS.\n\nThe inaugural crew for the seven-seat Starliner includes two veteran Nasa astronauts: Mr Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore, 61, a retired US Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Mrs Sunita \"Suni\" Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nThey have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each. Mr Wilmore is the designated commander for the flight, with Mrs Williams in the pilot seat. They are due to spend about a week at the ISS before returning to Earth.\n\nBoeing, with its commercial airplane operations rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 Max jetliners, needs a win in space for its Starliner venture, already several years behind schedule and more than US$1.5 billion over budget.\n\nStarliner two years ago completed its first test voyage to ISS and back without astronauts aboard.\n\nThe long-time Nasa contractor has built modules for the decades-old ISS and rockets designed to loft astronauts toward the moon. But Boeing never before built its own operational spacecraft, a feat complicated by years of software issues, technical glitches and management shake-ups on the Starliner programme.", "source":

The flight would carry NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore to the International Space Station and last about eight days, in a mission to test how the spacecraft operates in space with people on board.\n\nOnce Boeing completes the flight, NASA would certify Starliner to fly regular crew rotation missions to the space station, carrying a full contingent of four astronauts for six-month stays. NASA has been eager to get Boeing flying so that it would give the space agency another spacecraft in addition to SpaceX, which has been flying crews to the station since 2020.\n\nWhile Boeing has struggled, its delays have stood in stark contrast to SpaceX's success, and they highlight the gap between the way the two companies operate. Despite growing to more than 10,000 employees at multiple sites, SpaceX still performs like a scrappy start-up, able to move nimbly. It innovates quickly, testing hardware until it breaks, sometimes even triggering explosions, then makes adjustments and tries again and again until it gets it right. Instead of contracting with other companies for many of the parts that go into its vehicles, SpaceX builds much of its rockets and spacecraft in house.\n\nAs a massive defense contractor, Boeing operates in a more traditional manner, and flies when it thinks all of the hardware and subsystems have been thoroughly tested on the ground. The structure of the commercial crew contract, \"fixed price,\" meaning the companies eat any cost overruns, has been a difficult adjustment for Boeing, which typically has had \"cost-plus\" contracts with the government that reimbursed the company if it went over budget.\n\nThe upcoming crewed flight, then, is a critical milestone, one that Pam Melroy, the deputy NASA Administrator, has said is an \"existential\" moment for the company.\n\nBoeing's first crewed test flight was initially scheduled for May 6, but a couple hours before the scheduled launch time, teams noticed that a valve that regulates pressure and pushes the flow of propellants on the Atlas V rocket's second stage was malfunctioning and called off the launch. Teams swapped out the valve but then discovered a helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system, which officials said is so small it doesn't pose an issue for the flight.\n\nOn Saturday, Starliner was in the final four minutes of the countdown to launch when an automated computer called off the launch because one of the computer systems was slow to come online. If Wednesday's attempt is scrubbed, NASA has said Boeing could try again on Thursday. After then, however, the Atlas V rocket would have to roll back off the launchpad to swap out batteries, which would delay the flight for at least another 10 days.\n\nLeading up to the test mission, NASA and Boeing said repeatedly that they would take the utmost care to ensure that the flight is done as safely as possible, and that the lives of the astronauts on board were the top priority. Delays are normal in spaceflight, particularly with humans on board a spacecraft that has never flown people.\n\nTo get to this point, however, has been a long and painful road. In December 2019, Boeing thought Starliner was ready for its first test flight without anyone on board. It did not go well. The autonomous capsule's onboard computer was 11 hours off, so the spacecraft started executing commands for an entirely different part of the flight.\n\nEngineers also soon discovered a second software problem, which could have caused the service module to crash into the crew capsule during separation ahead of reentering Earth's atmosphere. The issues were so severe that NASA officials said the spacecraft could have been lost because of either of them, threatening the lives of astronauts, had any been on board. The flight never reached the space station but did return successfully.\n\nThe next launch attempt, in 2021, never got off the ground because several valves in the capsule's service module were corroded shut. It finally flew a successful uncrewed flight to the station in 2022, but afterward discovered flammable tape in the capsule that needed to be removed as well as problems with the parachute system.\n\nNASA and Boeing said in April they had solved all those problems and were ready. \"I can say with confidence that the teams have absolutely done their due diligence,\" said James Free, NASA's associate administrator. The test flight has been postponed five times since.\n\nSpaceX also had a series of setbacks initially that concerned NASA. Two of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets exploded, one in 2015, the other in 2016. And during a 2019 test of its emergency abort system, the Dragon capsule that was to carry astronauts also blew up.\n\nBut since then, SpaceX has flown multiple missions for NASA, as well as taken private astronauts to the station and to orbit. It also has received an extension on its contract with NASA to fly astronaut missions.\n\nIts relationship with NASA was a long time building. SpaceX initially won a contract in 2006 as part of a program to begin to develop cargo transportation to the space station, an award that essentially saved it from bankruptcy. In 2008, it won a $1.6 billion contract to begin flying supply missions to the station.\n\nAs NASA began relying on its rockets and spacecraft, SpaceX argued that the Pentagon should as well, and eventually the company started winning contracts to fly some of the country's most sensitive national security satellites to space.\n\nThe government's investment in SpaceX, as well as the company's high flight rate, in-house manufacturing and efficient business practices - along with CEO Elon Musk's unrelenting drive to push his employees to work harder and faster - has allowed it to offer launches at prices far below those of its competitors, which, in turn, has allowed it to capture more business and revenue.\n\nAs it has grown, SpaceX has moved to build a constellation of satellites, called Starlink, that allow users to access the internet, even from remote locations. SpaceX now operates about 6,000 Starlink satellites and says it has 3 million customers.\n\nIn addition to flying its Falcon 9 rocket, which launched almost 100 times last year, an unprecedented rate, it is now working toward developing its next-generation Starship rocket, the most powerful ever to fly.\n\nAs SpaceX's capabilities have grown, so has NASA's confidence, and investment, in the company.\n\nIn 2021, NASA awarded SpaceX a $2.9 billion contract to use Starship to land astronauts on the moon. On each of its first three test flights, Starship has made methodical progress. The fourth could come as early as Thursday, the day Boeing hopes Starliner will finally reach the space station.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vostok_1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vostok 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrator_of_NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Administrator of NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamela_Melroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pamela Melroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_propulsion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft propulsion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propellant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Propellant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/04/PDTN/73968904007-spaceflight-hr-5-zeggwzyi-6-zpqxfbqwjf-2-mkq.jpg?auto=webp&crop=4882,2745,x0,y342&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 3185, "textEnd": 3190}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-", "textStart": 4437, "textEnd": 4450}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Four of Starliner's malfunctioning jets were recovered, after NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams worked with flight controllers to test fire the thrusters.\n\nCAPCOM Nagata had the astronauts hold the spacecraft beyond the \"keep out sphere,\" an invisible boundary around the ISS that serves as a safety measure, while diagnosing the problematic thrusters.", "source": {"uri": "nbcboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_control_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reaction control system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Endeavour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle Endeavour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_controller", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight controller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://media.nbcboston.com/2024/06/107425251-1717693752316-boeing_starliner_iss_approach_1.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

SpaceX's Crew Dragon also came from this initiative and has racked up 12 crewed flights since it began operating in 2020.\n\nBut Boeing's capsule has lagged significantly behind. Starliner's first uncrewed test flight in 2019 was scuppered by a software fault that placed it in the wrong orbit, and a second attempt was held back by issues with a fuel valve. After more reviews last year, the company had to fix issues with the capsule's parachutes and remove around a mile (1.6 kilometers) of tape that was found to be flammable.\n\nThe current launch is Boeing's third attempt to take the crew to the ISS. The previous two were scrubbed by a vibrating oxygen valve on the United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket on which Starliner is mounted (and which was developed by Lockheed Martin) and a computer glitch in a ground launch sequencer, respectively.", "source": {"uri": "livescience.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "livescience.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_turner@livescience.com", "name": "Ben Turner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_E._Wilmore", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barry E.

But the spacecraft has experienced several problems since then, including the discovery of flammable tape in the cabin and weak parachutes.\n\nThe Voice of America provides news and information in more than 40 languages to an estimated weekly audience of over 326 million people.

They then moved the Starliner so that its solar array pointed at the sun to show they could charge the internal batteries if ever needed, Boeing said in a statement.\n\nNext, they swung Starliner around and pointed the nose away from Earth to look at the stars. This was to show they could manually use the star trackers in the VESTA system to establish their attitude in space in case all three flight computers were to ever go out or be turned off at the same time.\n\nThen, they manually sped Starliner up and then slowed it down, which slightly raised and then lowered their orbit. This was to show that the crew could manually break away from the space station orbit during rendezvous, if necessary.\n\nFinally, the crew manually pointed Starliner in the orientation needed for entry into the Earth's atmosphere, just in case they had to do that manually. During that manoeuvre, they again pointed the solar array at the sun to try a different method of confirming they could manually charge the batteries.\n\nThere is more manual piloting to come for this \"pilot's spacecraft\" with Wilmore and Williams on docking day, June 6.\n\nThe Starliner spacecraft, dubbed Calypso, has been developed by Boeing, under a contract from NASA. It has run into several delays and glitches in its developmental process.\n\nMoments before lift-off, Commander Wilmore called out to thank all those who had worked to make the mission possible. Alluding to past difficulties, he said: \"When the going gets tough - and it often does - the tough get going, and you have.\" Starliner's pilot Suni Williams chimed in: \"Go 'Calypso'! (the name of the capsule). Take us to space and back.\" This mission is a critical venture for manufacturer Boeing, which has been under pressure after a series of safety incidents on its aeroplanes.\n\nStarliner, likewise, has encountered numerous technical issues that have delayed its planned crewed debut by almost a decade.\n\nThe most dramatic of these problems occurred on the capsule's first uncrewed test flight in 2019 when software errors forced the vehicle to abort its trip to the ISS. Nasa requested a second dummy run be conducted in 2022 to be sure the errors had been corrected.\n\nStarliner was developed in response to NASA's request for commercial options to get its astronauts into space.\n\nFollowing the retirement of the famous shuttles in 2011, the agency wanted to move away from owning and operating vehicles to an arrangement where it could simply purchase the service - just like a company might outsource its IT needs or payroll.\n\nThe new approach was designed to save NASA money it could then spend on ambitious plans to return people to the Moon.\n\nThe agency gave contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to help bring their capsules into service and then pay them for six operational missions. Whereas SpaceX was able to fly its crew flight test in 2020 and then complete six operational missions by March of this year, Boeing is still at the stage of the initial crew flight test.

On its own, the spacecraft fired onboard thrusters to push itself into orbit, kicking off its 24-hour catch-up journey with the ISS, which orbits some 250 miles above Earth.\n\nBoeing intends for Starliner - seeded with Nasa funding - to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been the US space agency's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from US soil.\n\n\"This is another milestone in this extraordinary history of Nasa,\" the agency's administrator Bill Nelson told a press conference.\n\nThe mission is a test flight required before Nasa can certify Starliner for routine astronaut missions. Now in space, the capsule will need to execute precise maneuvers to dock with the ISS on Thursday, demonstrate it can stay docked for about eight days, then safely return the two astronauts to Earth, among other flight objectives.\n\nMark Nappi, Boeing's Starliner programme chief, told reporters that tens of thousands of things have to go right during Starliner's launch, and that on Wednesday \"it all lined up.\"\n\n\"We had just a perfect countdown and launch. ... It's been a long time coming. And we're really, really proud,\" Nappi said.\n\nBoeing shares closed up 0.7 per cent.\n\nLast-minute issues had nixed the Starliner's first two crewed launch attempts. A May 6 countdown was halted two hours before liftoff over three issues that required weeks of extra scrutiny. Another try last Saturday was halted less than four minutes before liftoff because of a launchpad computer glitch.\n\nThe seven-seat Starliner's inaugural crew includes two veteran Nasa astronauts in Wilmore, 61, a retired US Navy captain and fighter pilot, and Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter test pilot with experience flying more than 30 different aircraft.\n\nThey have spent a combined 500 days in space over the course of two ISS missions each. Wilmore is the designated commander, with Williams in the pilot seat.\n\nBoeing, with its commercial airplane operations rocked by a series of crises involving its 737 MAX jetliners, needs a win in space for its Starliner venture, already several years behind schedule and more than US$1.5 billion (S$2 billion) over budget. Getting Starliner to this point has been a fraught process for Boeing under its US$4.2 billion fixed-priced contract with Nasa, which wants the redundancy of two different US rides to the ISS.\n\nThe longtime Nasa contractor has built modules for the decades-old ISS and rockets designed to loft astronauts toward the moon. But Boeing never before built its own operational spacecraft, a feat complicated by years of software issues, technical glitches and management shakeups on the Starliner programme.\n\nSpaceX's Crew Dragon has become a dependable taxi to orbit for Nasa. That capsule and Starliner are among the first in a new generation of privately built spacecraft designed to fly astronauts to low-Earth orbit, and later to the moon under Nasa's Artemis programme.\n\nStarliner, which like Crew Dragon is reusable, would compete head-to-head with the SpaceX capsule, which since 2020 has been Nasa's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from US soil.\n\n\"Congratulations on a successful launch,\" Musk wrote on social media.\n\nBoeing intends to build two Starliner capsules that can carry out Nasa astronaut missions, and possibly more for private spaceflight missions, depending on commercial demand, Nappi said.\n\nThat demand is driven by government space agencies and early plans from other companies, such as Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, to build privately run space stations whose development Nasa is funding to replace the aging ISS in 2030. Crew Dragon has flown nine Nasa astronaut missions to the ISS and four private customer missions.\n\nWilmore and Williams are due to join ISS's current seven resident crew members before riding Starliner back to Earth for a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the US Desert Southwest - a first for a crewed Nasa mission.", "source": {"uri": "asiaone.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

(NASA/TNS)\n\nBeoing's Starliner capsule with two astronauts aboard was finally launched into space Wednesday after a series of delays that have vexed the troubled aerospace giant.\n\nThe test flight of the crew ship, developed to service the International Space Station, took off as scheduled at 7:52 a.m. Pacific from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\n\nThe capsule reached orbit after 32 minutes of flight and is expected to dock with the station around 9:15 a.m. Pacific tomorrow. It's the first time the capsule has carried astronauts after two prior uncrewed test flights.\n\nThe last scheduled launch of the CST-100 Starliner, which is years behind SpaceX in servicing the space station, was halted Saturday less than four minutes before liftoff by the ground computer that controls the final steps of the process. The problem was traced to a faulty computer power supply unit that was replaced.\n\nThe capsule was originally set to blast off May 6, but that flight was scuttled hours before liftoff because of a malfunctioning valve on the Atlas V rocket that launches it into space. The Atlas V, considered a reliable workhorse, is manufactured by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.\n\nAdditional launch dates were missed last month after a helium leak was found in the Starliner's propulsion system, which maneuvers the capsule. NASA and Boeing officials decided the leak was not serious enough to replace a defective seal, which would have taken months, and instead developed software fixes to work around it.\n\n\"For all practical purposes, SpaceX has become the player in the launch market. It's never good to have a monopoly,\" said aerospace analyst Marco Caceres of Teal Group, who applauded the flight's initial success. \"The best Boeing can hope for now is that they remain a player in this segment of the market.\"\n\nThe 15-foot diameter capsule is only the sixth spacecraft that NASA astronauts have ridden since the dawn of the space age, the first being the Project Mercury capsule and the most recent being SpaceX's Crew Dragon.\n\nVeteran astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have previously flown to the space station, are expected to spend about a week testing the capsule before returning to Earth mid-month.\n\nThe capsule will touch down in the Arizona or New Mexico desert in a parachute ground landing pioneered by the Soviets decades ago, rather than the ocean landings typical of U.S. space flights. Ground landings make it easier to refit the reusable capsule for future missions, though Starliner also can land in water in an emergency.\n\nThe flight, also carrying 760 pounds of cargo to the space station, is critical for the Arlington, Va., aerospace company, which is far behind SpaceX in launching a crewed capsule to service the space station.\n\nBoth companies were given multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to develop their crafts, and since 2020 Elon Musk's Hawthorne company has ferried more than a half dozen crews aboard its Crew Dragon to the station -- while Boeing has managed only two remote flights, including one in May 2022 that docked with the orbiting lab.\n\nThe companies were chosen by NASA after the agency has had to rely on the Russian program to send U.S. astronauts to the station when the space shuttle program ended in 2011. Assuming the Starliner mission goes well, it would then be certified to send four-person operational crews to the station for six-month missions. NASA would then have two U.S. spacecraft to service the station, but it also plans to continue to send some American astronauts via the Russian Soyuz craft.\n\nRussia and the U.S. were the primary builders of the space station, and play critical roles in keeping it aloft.\n\nBoeing has reportedly had to eat $1.5 billion in Starliner cost overruns and can ill afford a failure, especially after two crashes of its 737 Max 8 jets and the blowout of a door plug during a 737 Max 9 flight this year to Ontario International Airport in San Bernardino County.", "source": {"uri":

One helium leak had been discovered prior to launch and deemed acceptable.\n\n\"Helium is used in spacecraft thruster systems to allow the thrusters to fire and is not combustible or toxic,\" according to Boeing.\n\n\"Teams have identified three helium leaks on the spacecraft. One of these was previously discussed before flight along with a management plan,\" NASA shared in the post. \"The other two are new since the spacecraft arrived on orbit. Two of the affected helium valves have been closed and the spacecraft remains stable.\"\n\nA related exchange had taken place earlier on the NASA broadcast.\n\nJust as astronauts Butch Willmore and Suni Williams were about to go to sleep for the night, mission control informed them that they needed to shut down two valves due to the new helium leaks.\n\n\"Looks like we picked up a couple more helium leaks,\" mission control told the astronauts, as heard on the broadcast. Controllers then walked the crew through the plan to shut down the valves.\n\n\"We are ready to...find out exactly what you mean by picked up another helium leak, so give it to us,\" Wilmore told them.\n\n\"Butch, I'm sorry. We're still getting the story together,\" mission control replied.\n\nSince then, NASA and Boeing have determined the crew is safe and told them to go to sleep while they continue to look at the data. The crew was supposed to sleep for nine hours, but the troubleshooting effort cut into an hour of their rest.\n\n\"We have some issues to watch overnight when in regards to the helium leaks that was just brought up, and we have a lot of smart people down here on the ground that are going to take a look at this stuff and keep an eye on it, but the vehicle is in a configuration right now where they're safe to fly,\" Boeing aerospace engineer Brandon Burroughs said on the NASA broadcast.\n\nIn the meantime, the \"crew continues to make their way to the (ISS) and are in a sleep period,\" according to the post from NASA's Johnson Space Center.\n\nIt is still unclear what the impact of the leaks will be, but all indications are that the plan is still for Starliner to dock at the International Space Station on Thursday.\n\nHistoric launch\n\nStarliner's highly anticipated voyage lifted off atop an Atlas V rocket Wednesday at 10:52 a.m. ET from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The historic launch marked the first time the spacecraft has carried a crew to space.\n\nThe mission, known as the Crew Flight Test, is the culmination of Boeing's efforts to develop a spacecraft to rival SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule and expand the United States' options for ferrying astronauts to the space station under NASA's Commercial Crew Program. The federal agency's initiative aims to foster collaboration with private industry partners.\n\nThe flight marks only the sixth inaugural journey of a crewed spacecraft in US history, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson noted in a May news conference.\n\n\"It started with Mercury, then with Gemini, then with Apollo, the space shuttle, then (SpaceX's) Dragon -- and now Starliner,\" Nelson said.\n\nWilliams also made history as the first woman to fly aboard such a mission.\n\n\"This is another milestone in this extraordinary history of NASA,\" Nelson said Wednesday after the launch. \"And I want to give my personal congratulations to the whole team that went through a lot of trial and tribulation. But they had perseverance and that's what we do at NASA. We don't launch until it's right.\"\n\nAfter spending just over 24 hours traveling to the space station, Williams and Wilmore were expected to spend about eight days living in the orbiting laboratory, joining the seven astronauts and cosmonauts already on board.\n\nWeeks of troubleshooting\n\nA number of issues caused the previous crewed launch attempts, on May 6 and June 1, to be scrubbed.\n\nTwo hours prior to the launch attempt on May 6, engineers identified an issue with a valve on the second stage, or upper portion, of the Atlas V rocket, which was built by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The entire stack, including the rocket and spacecraft, was rolled back from the launchpad for testing and repairs.\n\nTeams also worked through a small helium leak within the spacecraft service module and a \"design vulnerability\" in the propulsion system.\n\nAfter troubleshooting the initial helium leak in May, mission specialists found it did not pose a threat to the flight. During the launch countdown Wednesday morning, teams monitored the leak and reported no issues.\n\nStarliner was just 3 minutes and 50 seconds from liftoff Saturday afternoon, when an automatic hold was triggered by the ground launch sequencer, or the computer that launches the rocket.\n\nUnited Launch Alliance technicians and engineers assessed the ground support equipment over the weekend, examining three large computers housed inside a shelter at the base of the launchpad. Each computer is the same, providing triple redundancy to ensure the safe launch of crewed missions.\n\nEngineers isolated the issue that halted Saturday's launch attempt to a single ground power supply within one of the computers, which provides power to the computer cards responsible for key countdown events, according to an update shared by NASA.\n\nThey removed the computer and replaced it with a spare.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashley_strickland@aol.com",

They awoke at 4:30 a.m. asking for an update after teams identified hours after launch two more helium leaks on top of one that was already known of before launch.\n\n\"Actually, umm, we're kind of curious where we stand as far as our leaks. If we could get a summary on that, that would be wonderful,\" Wilmore said.\n\nTwo of the valves were closed with the spacecraft remaining stable, according to NASA.\n\n\"Regarding the leaks we spoke of last night, the big picture is the current leak rates are, we are going to be able to support a rendezvous today with that,\" replied the NASA capsule communications officer Rob Hayhurst from Houston.\n\nNASA said the propellant team is working to increase pressure on parts of the propulsion system so the NASA astronauts would have adequate use of the engine jets to perform the planned test maneuvers before docking, but teams with NASA and Boeing will review data before the approach.\n\nThe helium leak that was known of before launch was the subject of several days of delay as teams determined the safety to the astronauts even if the leak got worse. Teams also worked through potential landing procedures if leaks were to spring up on more of the engines on the propulsion module to ensure Starliner could make it back to Earth.\n\nTheir arrival slated for 12:15 p.m. would come more than 25 hours after launching from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket.\n\nThe ISS population will temporarily go up to nine as Wilmore and Williams join the seven members of Expedition 71. That includes the four members of SpaceX's Crew-8 that flew up to the station in February on the Crew Dragon Endeavour.\n\n\"I'm really looking forward to seeing two U.S. vehicles at the International Space Station,\" said Ken Bowersox, the associate administrator for NASA's Space Operations Mission Directorate during a post-launch press conference Wednesday. \"I know Butch and Suni will probably get a kick out of that, if they get a chance, to look out the windows and see a Dragon there, see a Starliner there.

The Starliner, carried by a ULA (United Launch Alliance) Atlas V rocket from Space Launch Complex-41, aims to earn certification for rotational missions ferrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS). Starliner previously flew two uncrewed orbital flights, including a test to and from the space station, along with a pad abort demonstration.\n\n\"Two bold NASA astronauts are well on their way on this historic first test flight of a brand-new spacecraft,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \"Boeing's Starliner marks a new chapter of American exploration. Human spaceflight is a daring task - but that's why it's worth doing. It's an exciting time for NASA, our commercial partners, and the future of exploration. Go Starliner, Go Butch and Suni!\"\n\nWilliams' achievement on this Boeing Crew Flight Test (CFT) mission marks her third journey into space, adding to her illustrious career. With 322 days in orbit, she holds records for the most spacewalks (seven) and longest spacewalk time (50 hours, 40 minutes) by a woman, accomplishments from her previous ISS expeditions in 2006-2007 and 2012.\n\nBefore launching her NASA career in 1998, Williams earned a bachelor's degree in Physical Science from the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and a master's degree in Engineering Management from the Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne. Throughout her career, she has accumulated over 3,000 flight hours in more than 30 different aircraft. Williams comes from a multicultural heritage, being born to an Indian-American father from Gujarat and a Slovenian-American mother.\n\nSteve Stich, manager, Commercial Crew Program, at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston says, \"Flying crew on Starliner represents over a decade of work by the Commercial Crew Program and our partners at Boeing and ULA. For many of us, this is a career-defining moment bringing on a new crew transportation capability for our agency and our nation. We are going to take it one step at a time, putting Starliner through its paces, and remaining vigilant until Butch and Suni safely touch down back on Earth at the conclusion of this test flight.\"",

They then moved the Starliner so that its solar array pointed at the sun to show they could charge the internal batteries if ever needed, Boeing said in a statement.\n\nNext, they swung Starliner around and pointed the nose away from Earth to look at the stars. This was to show they could manually use the star trackers in the VESTA system to establish their attitude in space in case all three flight computers were to ever go out or be turned off at the same time.\n\nThen, they manually sped Starliner up and then slowed it down, which slightly raised and then lowered their orbit. This was to show that the crew could manually break away from the space station orbit during rendezvous, if necessary.\n\nFinally, the crew manually pointed Starliner in the orientation needed for entry into the Earth's atmosphere, just in case they had to do that manually. During that manoeuvre, they again pointed the solar array at the sun to try a different method of confirming they could manually charge the batteries.\n\nThere is more manual piloting to come for this \"pilot's spacecraft\" with Wilmore and Williams on docking day, June 6.\n\nThe Starliner spacecraft, dubbed Calypso, has been developed by Boeing, under a contract from NASA. It has run into several delays and glitches in its developmental process.\n\nMoments before lift-off, Commander Wilmore called out to thank all those who had worked to make the mission possible. Alluding to past difficulties, he said: \"When the going gets tough - and it often does - the tough get going, and you have.\" Starliner's pilot Suni Williams chimed in: \"Go 'Calypso'! (the name of the capsule). Take us to space and back.\" This mission is a critical venture for manufacturer Boeing, which has been under pressure after a series of safety incidents on its aeroplanes.\n\nStarliner, likewise, has encountered numerous technical issues that have delayed its planned crewed debut by almost a decade.\n\nThe most dramatic of these problems occurred on the capsule's first uncrewed test flight in 2019 when software errors forced the vehicle to abort its trip to the ISS. Nasa requested a second dummy run be conducted in 2022 to be sure the errors had been corrected.\n\nStarliner was developed in response to NASA's request for commercial options to get its astronauts into space.\n\nFollowing the retirement of the famous shuttles in 2011, the agency wanted to move away from owning and operating vehicles to an arrangement where it could simply purchase the service - just like a company might outsource its IT needs or payroll.\n\nThe new approach was designed to save NASA money it could then spend on ambitious plans to return people to the Moon.\n\nThe agency gave contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to help bring their capsules into service and then pay them for six operational missions. Whereas SpaceX was able to fly its crew flight test in 2020 and then complete six operational missions by March of this year, Boeing is still at the stage of the initial crew flight test.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaic_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photovoltaic system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_(radio)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antenna (radio)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_tracker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star tracker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space rendezvous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere of Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/Starliner-AP.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 1795, "textEnd": 1801}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

of delays and safety scares -- as well as two recently aborted launch attempts, before it finally got off the ground.\n\nNASA and Boeing teams were already aware of one small helium leak affecting one of Starliner's thrusters, which they discovered following the first aborted launch attempt in May.\n\nAfter testing it, they said the leak rate was well within safety limits and decided not to repair it, which would have been a complex procedure and involved taking Starliner apart at its factory.\n\nBut Starliner developed two more helium leaks during the mission, NASA said in a late update Wednesday on X.\n\n\"Two of the affected helium valves have been closed and the spacecraft remains stable,\" the space agency said, adding in a later update that mission managers have \"polled go\" for docking at the space station at 12:15 ET (1615 GMT).\n\nAstronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are the first crew to fly Starliner, which Boeing and NASA are hoping to certify for regular rides to the orbital outpost -- a role SpaceX has been fulfilling for the past four years, at significantly lower cost to the US taxpayer.\n\nStarliner is just the sixth type of US-built spaceship to fly NASA astronauts, following the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs in the 1960s and 1970s, the Space Shuttle from 1981 to 2011, and SpaceX's Crew Dragon from 2020.\n\nBoeing's program faced setbacks ranging from a software bug that put the spaceship on a bad trajectory on its first uncrewed test, to the discovery that the cabin was filled with flammable electrical tape after the second.\n\nia/st\n\nMore from this section\n\niEmergent's 2024-2026 U.S. Mortgage Origination Forecast is now available in Mortgage MarketSmart\n\nBoeing's space capsule springs more helium leaks on

developed two helium leaks since entering orbit but remains stable and on course for docking, NASA said.\n\nThe spaceship finally blasted off from Florida on Wednesday following years of delays and safety scares -- as well as two recently aborted launch attempts, before it finally got off the ground.\n\nNASA and Boeing teams were already aware of one small helium leak affecting one of Starliner's thrusters, which they discovered following the first aborted launch attempt in May.\n\nAfter testing it, they said the leak rate was well within safety limits and decided not to repair it, which would have been a complex procedure and involved taking Starliner apart at its factory.\n\nBut Starliner developed two more helium leaks during the mission, NASA said in a late update Wednesday on X.\n\n\"Two of the affected helium valves have been closed and the spacecraft remains stable,\" the space agency said, adding in a later update that mission managers have \"polled go\" for docking at the space station at 12:15 ET (1615 GMT).\n\nAstronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are the first crew to fly Starliner, which Boeing and NASA are hoping to certify for regular rides to the orbital outpost -- a role SpaceX has been fulfilling for the past four years, at significantly lower cost to the US taxpayer.\n\nStarliner is just the sixth type of US-built spaceship to fly NASA astronauts, following the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs in the 1960s and 1970s, the Space Shuttle from 1981 to 2011, and SpaceX's Crew Dragon from 2020.\n\nBoeing's program faced setbacks ranging from a software bug that put the spaceship on a bad trajectory on its first uncrewed test, to the discovery that the cabin was filled with flammable electrical tape after the second.",

Alluding to past difficulties, he said: \"When the going gets tough - and it often does - the tough get going, and you have.\"\n\nStarliner's pilot Suni Williams chimed in: \"Go 'Calypso'! (the name of the capsule). Take us to space and back.\"\n\nStarliner now has to raise itself to the orbit of the ISS, which circles the Earth at an altitude of roughly 400km (250 miles).\n\nIn the 24 hours this will take, Wilmore and Williams plan to put the vehicle through its paces, including taking manual control of the flight systems.\n\nThis mission is a critical venture for manufacturer Boeing, which has been under pressure after a series of safety incidents on its aeroplanes.\n\nStarliner, likewise, has encountered numerous technical issues that have delayed its planned crewed debut by almost a decade.\n\nThe most dramatic of these problems occurred on the capsule's first uncrewed test flight in 2019 when software errors forced the vehicle to abort its trip to the ISS. Nasa requested a second dummy run be conducted in 2022 to be sure the errors had been corrected.\n\nRecent days have once again focussed on Starliner's readiness with the discovery of a small helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system.\n\nDetailed analysis eventually led Boeing and Nasa to conclude the leak was not serious enough to hold up the launch.\n\nStarliner was developed in response to Nasa's request for commercial options to get its astronauts into space.\n\nFollowing the retirement of the famous shuttles in 2011, the agency wanted to move away from owning and operating vehicles to an arrangement where it could simply purchase the service - just like a company might outsource its IT needs or payroll.\n\nThe new approach was designed to save Nasa money it could then spend on ambitious plans to return people to the Moon.\n\nThe agency gave contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to help bring their capsules into service and then pay them for six operational missions. But whereas SpaceX was able to fly its crew flight test in 2020 and then complete six operational missions by March this year, Boeing is still at the stage of the initial crew flight test.\n\nIf Starliner can prove itself over the coming days, it will join SpaceX's Dragon capsule in the routine transport of astronauts, potentially as early as the beginning of next year.\n\n\"Right now, we have one provider giving us that access to the space station,\" top Nasa official Jim Free explained. \"This will give us a second provider, which means if we have a problem with either, we have ways to get our crews to and from station, which helps keep the tempo that we've had for 23 years of having humans in low Earth orbit,\" the associate administrator said.", "source": {"uri":

Poor NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, who were expecting to finally make it to the International Space Station, are still grounded at press time, waiting for the space company to get its act together.\n\nEngineers later discovered that the flight was stopped short 3 minutes and 50 seconds from liftoff by the three redundant computer racks being six seconds out of sync, triggering an automated hold.\n\nBoeing and NASA are now eying Wednesday or Thursday of this week for yet another try.\n\nThe scrub follows many years of delays, technical hiccups, and a failed uncrewed attempt to reach the ISS -- a laundry list of missteps, misjudgments, and bad luck.\n\nLast year, NASA and Boeing discovered flammable tape inside the spacecraft as well as problems with its parachutes.\n\nThen a May 6 launch attempt was unceremoniously called off with the astronauts already on board. After hearing a strange \"buzzing\" sound, officials discovered a faulty oxygen valve on the United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket.\n\nA separate helium leak, discovered late last month, was quickly pushed under the rug, with officials claiming that it wasn't going to be an issue even if it became significantly worse.\n\nIn short, the latest delay shouldn't come as much of a surprise after all that other chaos -- and it wouldn't be surprising if the launch were pushed back even further than the tentative date this week.\n\n\"I know it's a little disappointing,\" NASA's commercial crew program head Steve Stich told reporters over the weekend. \"We were all excited, and Butch and Suni were excited to go fly. This is kind of the way spaceflight is... Every time you go to the pad for crewed flight or really any flight, you've got a chance to scrubbing.\"\n\nThe stakes for the contractor are considerable. Without a successful crewed test flight under its belt, NASA won't certify Boeing's Starliner for regular cargo and crew missions to the ISS.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX has run circles around Boeing, with its Crew Dragon capsule making ten successful trips to the ISS over the last five years.\n\nDeputy NASA Administrator Pam Melroy called Boeing's long-delayed test flight an \"existential\" moment for the company. Worse yet, the aerospace giant has been mired in controversy back on Earth, dealing with some glaring safety issues plaguing its passenger jet fleet, including a \"plug door\" that blew out of a 737 Max 9 in January, not to mention other planes losing parts midflight and its CEO departing under a dark cloud.\n\nPut simply, Boeing's Starliner remains a massive headache for the company, and the more it delays its test flight, the steeper the cost overruns. That's thanks to the company's \"fixed price\" contract under NASA's commercial crew program, which forces Boeing to absorb those costs.\n\nAs it stands, Boeing still has a lot to prove, and with its Starliner in a holding pattern, the pressure is only bound to build on the company -- especially considering its spacecraft has in many ways been made obsolete by SpaceX's proven alternative.", "source": {"uri": "futurism.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Futurism"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Redundancy (engineering)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrator_of_NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Administrator of NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamela_Melroy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pamela Melroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug_door", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plug door"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_airliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jet airliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://wp-assets.futurism.com/2024/06/boeing-excuses-push-back-first-astronaut-launch.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1039, "textEnd": 1044}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Boeing built Starliner under a $4.2 billion contract with NASA to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, aiming to provide NASA with an alternative vehicle for sending astronauts to the ISS from U.S. soil.\n\nWhat's Next: The astronauts will be welcomed by seven residents on the ISS: four U.S. astronauts and three Russian cosmonauts.\n\nWilmore and Williams are scheduled to stay aboard the ISS for about eight days before departing on a return flight.\n\nThe return journey will involve a fiery re-entry into Earth's atmosphere, culminating in a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the U.S. Desert Southwest, marking a first for a crewed NASA mission.\n\nPrice Action: BA shares are trading lower by 0.45% at $189.00 in premarket at the last check Thursday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nRead Next: Boeing Executives Unlikely To Face Criminal Charges\n\nImage: Shutterstock", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_E._Wilmore", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barry E.

He was selected as an astronaut in 2000.\n\nYesterday's launch was the third attempt that Boeing and Nasa have made in under a month to send the astronauts to the station.\n\nThe original launch date of May 6 was cancelled only hours before lift-off due to a faulty oxygen relief valve in the Atlas V rocket's Centaur upper stage.\n\nThe investigation and replacement of the valve pushed the launch back to May 17, and then further delays occurred after a helium leak was detected in the Starliner's service module.\n\nBoeing completed an unmanned test flight in 2022 when a Starliner capsule docked on the ISS and returned to Earth.\n\nThe launch came after an unsuccessful test flight in 2019, in which the craft failed to reach the station due to a software glitch.\n\nElon Musk's SpaceX, also

Boeing is testing the capsule's capability to transport crews to the International Space Station (ISS), with Starliner docking at the ISS.\n\nIn development since 2010, Starliner is part of a $4.3 billion contract with NASA. Perhaps surprisingly, this is only the sixth vehicle owned or funded by the space agency to be used throughout the agency's storied history.\n\nThe space agency has been around since 1958, yet only a select few spacecraft have transported NASA astronauts to space. Boeing's Starliner now joins a rather exclusive list; here are all the spacecraft that have flown with NASA crews on board.\n\nOn May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard became the first U.S. astronaut to go to space on board the Mercury space capsule. The 15-minute suborbital flight was NASA's first dipping of its toes into the celestial waters, with the main objectives being to assess human capabilities in a space environment and safely return astronauts to Earth.\n\nProject Mercury, the first American human spaceflight program, ran from 1958 through 1963. In the photo above, Project Mercury astronaut John H. Glenn, Jr. is seen entering his Mercury Friendship 7 capsule before launch on February 20, 1962. Glenn became the first U.S. astronaut to orbit Earth during his nearly 5-hour flight. Glenn's flight was cut short by a faulty signal indicating a problem with the heat shield, but he returned to Earth safely after three orbits.\n\nAfter astronauts got a taste of orbital space, it was time to train them for the Moon. Project Gemini served as a bridge between Mercury and Apollo.\n\nWith the Gemini missions, NASA achieved the first rendezvous of two human spacecraft in orbit. In this photo taken on December 15, 1965, the Gemini VI spacecraft can be seen through the hatch window of Gemini VII at an altitude of 160 miles (258 kilometers) above Earth.\n\nUnlike the Mercury spacecraft, which was just barely big enough to fit one astronaut, the Gemini capsule carried two astronauts on board. Through their missions, the astronauts could change the capsule's orbit, work outside of the spacecraft, and remain in space for at least two weeks.\n\nOn July 20, 1969, NASA astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin Jr. became the first to land on the surface of the Moon.\n\nThe Apollo 11 crew rode on board the Apollo Command and Service Module (CSM), named Columbia, which transported them to lunar orbit. From there, the pair hopped on the Lunar Module, which they used to touchdown on the Moon's surface, while pilot Michael Collins remained on board the CSM spacecraft in orbit. The Lunar Module (LM) took off from the Moon on July 21, and the crew returned to Earth three days later. So in this sense, NASA utilized two crew-rated spacecraft for the mission: CSM and LM, though the latter could only return astronauts back to space from the lunar surface.\n\nThe photo above was taken on December 14, 1972, revealing a view of the CSM, which was piloted by Apollo 17 astronaut Ronald Evans, from the Lunar Module, which has astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt on board.\n\nNASA's iconic Space Shuttle era spanned across 30 years, operating from 1981 to 2011. The partially reusable low Earth orbital spacecraft flew a total of 135 missions, carrying astronauts to orbit, repairing hardware in space, and even helping to build the largest structure in Earth's orbit, the ISS.\n\nThe Space Shuttle not only increased NASA's access to space, but it also inspired a new era in spaceflight. In the above photo, the Space Shuttle Discovery is seen from the ISS after the two spacecraft had separated on March 7, 2011.\n\nFollowing the retirement of the Space Shuttle, NASA relied heavily on Russia's Soyuz spacecraft to transport its astronauts to the ISS. Soyuz was designed for the Soviet space program and has been operational since the 1960s. Unlike its orbital counterparts on this list, this spacecraft was not developed by, or with the help of, NASA but it still deserves an honorable mention. The spacecraft launches from Kazakhstan and takes about six hours to arrive at the ISS. A seat swap arrangement with the Russian space agency Roscosmos occasionally sees NASA astronauts still riding aboard the Soyuz.\n\nNASA needed to stop relying so heavily on Soyuz for rides to the ISS, and so it forged partnerships with private companies to help launch its astronauts to space.\n\nAt the time SpaceX was awarded its NASA contract, it was the less expensive proposal at $2.6 billion. Boeing was seen as a more reliable company with a better track record. It's safe to say things have drastically changed since then, with SpaceX launching its eighth crew to the ISS in March 2024 while its counterpart lags terribly behind.\n\nSpaceX's Dragon spacecraft is capable of carrying up to seven passengers to and from Earth orbit, and measures at 26.7 feet tall (8 meters). It's equipped with two drogue parachutes to stabilize the spacecraft after it reenters through Earth's atmosphere, plus four main parachutes to decelerate it prior to an ocean landing.\n\nThe $4.2 billion CST-100 Starliner was first conceived in 2010, built on a long legacy of designing and building spacecraft for Apollo. The spacecraft measures 14.8 feet (4.5 meters) across and can fit up to seven astronauts, and is around the same size as the Dragon crew capsule.\n\nUnlike SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft, however, Starliner has traditional hand controls and switches, as well as touchscreens. The Crewed Flight Test (CFT) will carry NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams on board Starliner.\n\nAs NASA prepares to land astronauts on the Moon, the space agency developed a crew capsule to carry its next-generation explorers to lunar orbit. The spacecraft has yet to perform a mission with actual astronauts on board, but the vessel is crew-rated and ready for the task.\n\nThe Orion capsule is designed to carry a crew of four astronauts to beyond Earth orbit and accommodate its passengers for up to 21 days. Orion already flew to the Moon and back during the uncrewed Artemis 1 test flight in late 2022, and it is currently being prepped for its first crewed flight in September 2025 -- the much-anticipated Artemis 2 mission. That said, the capsule still has a few outstanding safety issues, including a wonky heat shield, that could jeopardize its upcoming mission.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

The Crewed Flight Test (CFT) took off from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, at 10:52 a.m. EDT (07:52 PDT) atop a ULA Atlas V rocket. For this mission, the capsule is carrying two NASA astronauts: Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore (commander) and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams (pilot). They are expected to reach the International Space Station (ISS) at 12:15 p.m. EDT (09:15 a.m. PDT) on Thursday, June 6th.\n\nAssuming all goes to plan, this mission will effectively validate the Starliner as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program (CCP). Then, we can expect it to make regular deliveries of cargo and crew to the ISS alongside SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft. This mission is the second time the Starliner has flown to the ISS and the third flight test overall. During the first test flight (OFT-1), which took place back in December 2019, the Starliner launched successfully but failed to make it to the ISS. After making 61 corrective actions recommended by NASA, another attempt was made (OFT-2) on May 22nd, 2022.\n\nThough two of the spacecraft's thrusters failed during the flight, the spacecraft managed to reach the ISS and delivered 227 kg (500 lbs) of cargo. After nearly two years of delays, another attempt was made on June 1st, but the launch was scrubbed 3 minutes and 50 seconds before liftoff due to a faulty power supply. But, as they say, the third time is the charm! The launch was followed by a NASA news conference at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, beginning at 12:30 a.m. EDT (09:30 a.m. PDT), which NASA live-streamed via NASA+, the NASA app, YouTube, and the agency's website.\n\nThe conference was chaired by NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, Associate Administrator Ken Bowersox and Deputy Associate Administrator Joel Montalbano (NASA's Space Operations Mission Directorate), Manager Steve Stitch and Mark Nappi (the manager and VP and program manager of CCP), and ULA president and CEO Tory Bruno.

Hines, who flew on SpaceX Crew-4, returned to Earth from half a year in space that October, to learn that NASA wanted him to help see Starliner through its first crewed mission.\n\nIt took extra time after new technical issues arose, but Starliner at last lifted off yesterday (May 21) aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on its debut astronaut mission. Hines, a former U.S. Navy test pilot, shares that military heritage with the two members of Starliner's Crew Flight Test (CFT): NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.\n\nA big advantage of that military background, he told Space.com at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in early May, is everyone has a handle on \"test fundamentals\" they learned in the prestigious Naval Test Pilot School. \"It's about teamwork, and building and leading teams to go do hard things,\" Hines said of the experience. \"That's fundamental to it.\"\n\nRelated: Boeing's Starliner is a 'big piece of America's overall strategy for access to low Earth orbit,' astronaut says\n\nHines is a member of the joint test team, a team within the commercial crew program that manages the test and verification of commercial crew vehicles. Additionally, he is assistant to NASA's chief astronaut on the commercial crew side -- that's a sort of technical advisory role to advise the chief on progress, he explained.\n\nStarliner, one of NASA's two commercial crew vehicles, flew its first crewed mission four years after SpaceX's Crew Dragon in 2020. SpaceX had the advantage of borrowing design and experience from eight years of cargo Dragon missions, while Starliner was a new spacecraft.\n\nAs such, Starliner met snags: its first uncrewed mission in 2019 failed to reach the ISS as planned after software glitches stranded the spacecraft in the wrong orbit. While Hines safely saw a second Starliner berth flawlessly in 2022, crewed missions were again delayed last year by issues with the parachutes and with wiring. (All issues were addressed to NASA's and Boeing's satisfaction well ahead of CFT, officials have repeatedly emphasized in recent months.)\n\nRead more: After an 'emotional rollercoaster,' NASA astronauts are ready to fly on Boeing Starliner\n\nDesign decisions, Hines explained, are always difficult as aerospace technicians need to consider \"trades\": emphasizing one aspect of a spacecraft (such as more mass) means that something has to give somewhere else (available rocket fuel to carry other things, for example). Hines was part of the team working to make smart trades as Starliner met its final design challenges.\n\n\"Sometimes maybe it's not about solving it technically, but procedurally, and getting the teams together and building that kind of cohesion so that we can have those conversations and make those trades,\" he explained. \"Everything's a compromise. So it really is all about getting those different points of view together, getting them all laid out on the table, and then figuring out what the best path forward is.\"\n\nThat design process continues even after Starliner returns, as future missions are put in process. Starliner-1, the first operational crewed mission with astronauts, has most of its hardware ready to go for a launch no earlier than early 2025. Assuming all goes to plan on CFT, that spacecraft will fly mostly as-is, with future missions gaining deeper design \"lessons learned\" from the pioneering astronaut mission.\n\n\"We're going be looking at looking at this data [from CFT] and seeing is it what we expect? If it's not, why? Trying to figure those kinds of things out,\" Hines explained. \"It is a test flight. So we fully expect to have some unexpected things arise during this test flight. And so that's kind of where I'm coming in along with the other team -- members of the Joint test team -- to analyze that data and really look at it.\"\n\nHines plans to capture the crew's experience even during the flight, which will include space-to-ground interviews in which he talks to Wilmore and Williams while matters are fresh on their mind. \"We'll have a series of questions. We'll take their comments down. And then we'll pair all that up with the data that we saw.\"\n\n\"It's really important,\" he added of the process. \"Those of us that grow up in flight tests, we get in the habit of talking into the tapes, we say it. We are making comments real-time, and they might be short and abbreviated, but [it is a] memory jogger so that when we come back, we can recall what that detail was.\"", "source": {"uri": "space.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Space.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elizabeth_howell@space.com", "name": "Elizabeth Howell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Development of the Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Crew-4", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Crew-4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hines_(astronaut)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Hines (astronaut)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low Earth orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jVkCLi7i86ZTNDKuB8Ty2U-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 642, "textEnd": 648}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

The Indian-origin NASA astronaut Sunita Williams has scripted history again as she onboarded Boeing's Starliner crew flight along with Butch Wilmore. Notably, this is Sunita William's third space mission. Boeing's Crew Flight was successfully launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.\n\nThe Boeing's Crew Flight Test mission is expected to last about a week. It aims to test the Starliner spacecraft comprehensively. Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore will evaluate the spacecraft's performance, including manual control during the journey to the International Space Station (ISS). They will also conduct tests to determine if Starliner can serve as a safe haven during emergencies on the ISS. The mission will conclude with Starliner re-entering the atmosphere and landing with the assistance of parachutes and airbags in the western United States.\n\nThe launch had faced several delays. The most recent attempt was halted just minutes before liftoff due to a faulty power supply, which has since been replaced. Another delay occurred on May 6 because of a valve issue on the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket.

The two crew members are expected to spend just over 24 hours traveling to the space station and eight days with seven astronauts and cosmonauts already on board in the orbiting laboratory.\n\nThe current mission, a crew flight test, is the product of a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin to rival Elon Musk's SpaceX Dragon capsule and operated under Nasa's commercial crew program.\n\nThe Starliner launch is only the sixth inaugural journey of a US crewed spacecraft since the start of the space race in the late 1950s. \"It started with Mercury, then with Gemini, then with Apollo, the space shuttle, then [SpaceX's] Dragon - and now Starliner,\" the Nasa administrator, Bill Nelson, said last month.\n\nThe Starliner is a variant of the Atlas V military rocket using Russian-developed engines but with two strap-on boosters.

docking with ISS", "body": "Washington (AFP) - The planned docking of a Boeing Starliner capsule carrying its first astronauts to the International Space Station has been delayed as teams work to troubleshoot problems affecting the propulsion system, NASA said Thursday.\n\nCrewmates Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are currently holding around 650 feet (200 meters) from the orbital outpost because of issues with reaction control system (RCS) thrusters that provide fine maneuvering capabilities.\n\nRendezvous was planned for 12:15 pm ET, but now cannot take place before 1:33 pm ET (1733 GMT) at the earliest, NASA announcers said during a live feed.\n\nThe astronauts, both ex-Navy test pilots, were piloting the craft manually, carrying out \"hot fire tests\" in an effort to restart the malfunctioning thrusters.\n\nEarlier, NASA said the spaceship had sprung two new helium leaks since entering orbit, in addition to one leak that teams knew about before liftoff but chose not to repair, because the leak rate was within safety limits.\n\nIt was not yet clear if the leaks and the thruster issues were linked.\n\nThe spaceship finally blasted off from Florida on Wednesday following years of delays and safety scares -- as well as two recently aborted launch attempts that came as astronauts were already strapped in and ready to go.\n\nAstronauts Wilmore and Williams are the first crew to fly Starliner, which Boeing and NASA are hoping to certify for regular rides to the ISS -- a role SpaceX has been fulfilling for the past four years, at significantly lower cost to the US taxpayer.\n\nStarliner is just the sixth type of US-built spaceship to fly NASA astronauts, following the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs in the 1960s and 1970s, the Space Shuttle from 1981 to 2011, and SpaceX's Crew Dragon from 2020.\n\nBoeing's program faced setbacks ranging from a software bug that put the spaceship on a bad trajectory on its first uncrewed test, to the discovery that the cabin was filled with flammable electrical tape after the second.\n\nA successful mission would help dispel the bitter taste left by years of safety scares and delays, and provide Boeing a much-needed reprieve from the intense safety concerns surrounding its passenger jets.\n\nDuring their roughly weeklong stay on the orbital outpost, Wilmore and Williams will continue to evaluate the spacecraft systems, including simulating whether the ship can be used as a safe haven in the event of problems.\n\nAfter undocking from the ISS, Starliner will re-enter the atmosphere, with the crew experiencing 3.5G as they slow down from 17,500 miles per hour (28,000 kph) to a gentle parachute- and airbag-assisted touchdown in the western United States.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com",

This mission marks Williams' third spaceflight and the first crewed mission for the Starliner spacecraft, dubbed Calypso.\n\nWilliams, 58, serving as the pilot, and Wilmore, 61, the mission commander, performed a series of manual piloting demonstrations during the 25-hour flight. Although Starliner is designed to be autonomous, the crew used the hand controller for several maneuvers, including pointing the spacecraft's nose toward Earth to align the communications antenna and adjusting the solar array for battery charging.\n\nThe crew also demonstrated their ability to manually navigate using the star trackers in the VESTA system and conducted orbital adjustments to simulate breaking away from the space station orbit. Additionally, they practiced orienting the spacecraft for re-entry into Earth's atmosphere and confirmed they could manually charge the batteries if needed.\n\nThis mission is critical for Boeing, which has faced several delays and technical issues with the Starliner development. The spacecraft's first uncrewed test flight in 2019 was marred by software errors, necessitating a second test in 2022. Boeing's successful crew flight test is a significant step toward fulfilling NASA's commercial crew program goals.\n\nBoeing developed Starliner in response to NASA's request for commercial crew transport options following the retirement of the Space Shuttle program in 2011. The agency's shift to purchasing services from commercial providers aimed to save money for other ambitious projects, including the return of humans to the Moon.

The timeline shifted further to the right after a helium leak was detected in one of Starliner's reaction-control thrusters. The launch team ultimately deemed the leak a minor issue and cleared CFT for a June 1 liftoff. That try was aborted just minutes before launch thanks to faulty ground equipment, pushing the next attempt back to June 5.\n\nCFT is the third mission for Starliner, following uncrewed launches toward the ISS in December 2019 and May 2022.

The two astronauts on board, Pilot Sunita Williams and Commander Butch Wilmore played a significant role in developing the spacecraft itself as well as the training procedures for operating the vehicle. The astronauts will provide feedback to the ground teams on the comfort and ergonomics of the brand new crew module, for further tweaks, if necessary. One of the overarching goals of the mission is to collect as much data as possible on the performance of the spacecraft.\n\nThe astronauts were using tablets on board the Starliner, and the ground control teams had to coordinate closely to ensure all of them were juiced up, which is something those on the ground can relate with. The spaceship began the approach after fourteen orbits, and was a just a bit below the altitude of the nominal flight trajectory. The Starliner began approaching the ISS by firing its 20 Orbital Manoeuvring and Attitude Control (OMAC) thrusters. Close to the station, the Starliner only used the smaller Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters, until the docking operation. The 28 RCS thrusters allow for more fine-tuned burns, especially for proximity operations.\n\nA couple of RCS thrusters failed on the service module, causing the Starliner to go into a hold, not getting the clearance to approach and dock the space station. The spacecraft waited for directions from the ground at a distance of about 200 metres from the ISS, which is the extent of the keep out sphere, which functions as an invisible barrier. The Starliner missed the first docking opportunity, but successfully docked at the second one, at 23:05 hours IST.\n\nThe launch itself proceeded nominally, without any issues developing. The ground teams had plenty of experience with the procedures considering that the launch was scrubbed twice. This was the first docking of the Starliner to the ISS. This is also the first crewed test flight of the Boeing Starliner, which will return the astronauts on board to land on an American mission to the ISS, for the first time. This is also the first test flight of an orbital spacecraft piloted by a woman, and the fifth ever orbital test flight of a crewed vehicle by NASA after Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, the Space Shuttle and the SpaceX Dragon.

He also served as a Navy test pilot and flight instructor before joining the NASA astronaut corps in 2000.\n\nHe first flew to the space station as a NASA space shuttle pilot in 2009, and returned to the orbiting laboratory in 2014 - launched aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft with two cosmonauts - for a long-duration mission, including several months as station commander.\n\nTo date, Wilmore has logged 178 days in space and four spacewalks.\n\nA Tennessee native who played college football while attending Tennessee Tech University, Wilmore holds advanced degrees in electrical engineering and aviation systems. He is married with two daughters.\n\nWilliams, 58, a former Navy helicopter pilot with experience flying more than 30 different rotary aircraft, was deployed as part of a helicopter combat support squadron during the first Gulf War. She later flew in support of Navy disaster relief operations in Florida following Hurricane Andrew.\n\nShe returned to the naval test pilot school as a rotary aircraft instructor before being selected for the NASA astronaut program in 1998.\n\nLike Wilmore, Williams first flew to the space station aboard a space shuttle and made a return visit as a Soyuz passenger riding along with two cosmonauts. Both her ISS tours - in 2006-2007 and in 2012 - were long-duration science expeditions.\n\nAfter two stays aboard the outpost, Williams had set a world record for the most time spent by a woman in orbit outside a spacecraft, logging a total of 50 hours and 40 minutes combined during seven spacewalks. Her record has since been surpassed by fellow astronaut Peggy Whitson.\n\nDuring her second ISS mission in 2012, Williams became only the second woman designated as commander of the station.\n\nAn avid athlete, Williams in 2007 became the first person to complete a marathon in space, competing virtually in the Boston Marathon from orbit on the space station's treadmill to go the distance in four hours and 24 minutes.\n\nTaking the concept to the next level, Williams in 2012 completed the first triathlon in space, again using the treadmill and a stationary bicycle, then performing a mix of weight-lifting and resistance exercises on a fitness machine that approximated swimming in microgravity.\n\nSo far, Williams has spent a total of 322 days in space, and now made history again by becoming the first woman to fly on the inaugural crewed mission of a new orbital spacecraft.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nBorn in Massachusetts, Williams currently resides in Houston with her husband, a federal police officer who also flew helicopters earlier in his career.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is

This is the third space journey that Williams has gone out for. Williams, who is 58 years old, has been assigned the duty of pilot for the test flight whereas Wilmore, 61, is the mission commander.\n\nFollowing Test conducted on the aircraft:\n\nBoth astronauts spent two hours testing the manual controls, however the Starliner functions autonomously. They directed the spacecraft by applying various techniques during free-flight demonstrations by using the hand controller.\n\nWhile conducting a far-field demonstration, they guided the Starliner's nose heading toward Earth, ensuring the communication antenna on the Service Module was aligned with the Data Relay Satellites and the tracking. Next, they positioned the aircraft in such a direction that its solar array faced the sun. This way, the spacecraft can charge the internal batteries if there is a need, according to the statement released by Boeing.\n\nFor observing stars, they pointed the Starliner's nose away from the Earth, demonstrating the spacecraft's ability to use the star trackers for altitude determination. This step can be taken if in any case, all three flight computers get deactivated or fail to function.\n\nThe crew also demonstrated that they can manually adjust the orbit by increasing and reducing the aircraft speed if required. In the final demonstration, they directed the Starliner to re-enter Earth's atmosphere and showcased the aircraft's skills of charging the batteries by positioning the solar array in the direction of the Sun.\n\nWhy is this mission crucial for Boeing?\n\nThis mission holds utmost importance for Boeing as recently the firm has been in the news for its aircraft technical problems which resulted in delaying its crew debut by almost 10 years.

Both will be arriving at the ISS for the third time.\n\nHere are more details about the astronauts:\n\n* Wilmore, 61, a retired U.S. Navy captain, completed four operational deployments flying fighter jets off the decks of aircraft carriers, including 21 combat missions during the first U.S. Gulf War in the 1990s. He also served as a Navy test pilot and flight instructor before joining the NASA astronaut corps in 2000.\n\nHe first flew to the space station as a NASA space shuttle pilot in 2009, and returned to the orbiting laboratory in 2014 - launched aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft with two cosmonauts - for a long-duration mission, including several months as station commander.\n\nTo date, Wilmore has logged 178 days in space and four spacewalks.\n\nA Tennessee native who played college football while attending Tennessee Tech University, Wilmore holds advanced degrees in electrical engineering and aviation systems. He is married with two daughters.\n\n* Williams, 58, a former Navy helicopter pilot with experience flying more than 30 different rotary aircraft, was deployed as part of a helicopter combat support squadron during the first Gulf War. She later flew in support of Navy disaster relief operations in Florida following Hurricane Andrew.\n\nShe returned to the naval test pilot school as a rotary aircraft instructor before being selected for the NASA astronaut program in 1998.\n\nLike Wilmore, Williams first flew to the space station aboard a space shuttle and made a return visit as a Soyuz passenger riding along with two cosmonauts. Both her ISS tours - in 2006-2007 and in 2012 - were long-duration science expeditions.\n\nAfter two stays aboard the outpost, Williams had set a world record for the most time spent by a woman in orbit outside a spacecraft, logging a total of 50 hours and 40 minutes combined during seven spacewalks. Her record has since been surpassed by fellow astronaut Peggy Whitson.\n\nDuring her second ISS mission in 2012, Williams became only the second woman designated as commander of the station.\n\nAn avid athlete, Williams in 2007 became the first person to complete a marathon in space, competing virtually in the Boston Marathon from orbit on the space station's treadmill to go the distance in four hours and 24 minutes.\n\nTaking the concept to the next level, Williams in 2012 completed the first triathlon in space, again using the treadmill and a stationary bicycle, then performing a mix of weight-lifting and resistance exercises on a fitness machine that approximated swimming in microgravity.\n\nSo far, Williams has spent a total of 322 days in space, and now made history again by becoming the first woman to fly on the inaugural crewed mission of a new orbital spacecraft.\n\nBorn in Massachusetts, Williams currently resides in Houston with her husband, a federal police officer who also flew helicopters earlier in his career.\n\n(Compiled by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Will Dunham)", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors":

On board Starliner are NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.\n\nThat docking took place more than an hour behind schedule as engineers worked on as many as five reaction control system (RCS) thrusters that went offline during various phases of the spacecraft's approach. Space station controllers kept Starliner outside the 200-meter \"keep out sphere\" of the station while working to bring those thrusters back into operation.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what caused the thrusters to malfunction. Late June 5, NASA and Boeing said that spacecraft controllers had detected two more helium leaks in Starliner's propulsion system. These were separate from the helium leak detected after a scrubbed May 6 launch attempt, and took some thrusters offline.\n\nMission managers approved plans to allow the docking to proceed early June 6, deciding to use extra helium to repressurize the system and re-enable the thrusters.\n\nStarliner is scheduled to remain docked to the station for at least eight days, although agency officials said at a post-launch briefing June 5 that they will keep Starliner at the station longer to complete planned tests.\n\nWilmore said in a communications session June 5 that he and Williams were largely pleased with the performance of the spacecraft as well as the experience of launch. At that point in the mission, about six hours after launch, he said that the mission was going \"fabulously.\"\n\nHe specifically called out the ability of the spacecraft to perform manual maneuvers. \"Suni and I have both done some manual maneuvering, and it is precise,\" he said. \"Much more so than the simulator.\"\n\nWilliams highlighted the suits developed for Starliner that she and Wilmore wore. \"They are really great suits: easy to operate in, easy to move around in,\" she said. \"It's another great day in space.\"", "source": {"uri": "spacenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SpaceNews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_foust@spacenews.com", "name": "Jeff Foust", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_control_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reaction control system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony_(ISS_module)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harmony (ISS module)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Tributes", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Tributes", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cft-docking.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 133, "textEnd": 139, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 901, "textEnd": 907, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1094, "textEnd": 1099}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Williams, a veteran of two other space missions, previously told reporters that she brings some essentials including sacred texts Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita and, of course, samosas.\n\n\"I really appreciate my Indian heritage and was glad I could bring part of it with me to space,\" Williams said during a 2013 news conference at the National Science Centre in Delhi, before referencing the elephant-headed Hindu god. \"Ganesh has always been in my house. Everywhere I've lived, I've had Ganesh, and so he had to come with me to space, of course. And Indian food -- you can never get enough of Indian food ... so I had to make sure I had some samosas in space with me. Other types of Indian food we definitely had up there as well.\"\n\nWilliams, whose father is Indian and mother is of Slovenian descent, has been open about the importance of her heritage. While on Expedition 32/33 in 2012, she also sent out a greeting from space during Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights.\n\nNASA selected Williams as an astronaut in 1998. She has spent a total of 322 days and performed seven space walks across her two extended missions in space.

Additionally, China's Chang'e-6 probe carried lunar rocks back to Earth, and rare dinosaur fossils were found.\n\nFollowing is a summary of current science news briefs.\n\nChile to install world's largest astronomy camera on the edge of Atacama desert\n\nWith a resolution above 3.2 gigapixels, a nearly three-ton weight and the ambitious task of carrying out an unprecedented decade-long exploration, the largest digital camera ever built for optical astronomy is ready to be installed under the clear skies of northern Chile. The pieces required to assemble the Vera C. Rubin Observatory - which includes a ground-based telescope and the camera - traveled in several vehicles to the summit of Cerro Pach\u00f3n in the Coquimbo region, on the edge of the Atacama desert, some 565 kilometers north of Santiago.\n\nBoeing's Starliner spacecraft sends first astronaut crew to orbit\n\nBoeing's new Starliner capsule flew its first crew of astronauts to orbit on Wednesday from Florida in a much-delayed test mission to the International Space Station, a milestone in the aerospace giant's ambitions to step up its competition with Elon Musk's SpaceX. The CST-100 Starliner, with astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams aboard, lifted off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, strapped to an Atlas V rocket furnished and flown by the Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA).\n\nEurope's Ariane 6 rocket debut planned for July 9\n\nEurope's new Ariane 6 satellite launcher will stage a long-awaited inaugural flight on July 9, the head of the European Space Agency said at the Berlin Airshow on Wednesday. The delayed debut comes a year after its predecessor, Ariane 5, was retired, leaving Europe with no independent path to orbit for its satellites after setbacks involving a smaller Italian alternative and the severing of ties with Russia over Ukraine.\n\nClimate change made devastating Brazil floods twice as likely, scientists say\n\nClimate change made the recent flooding that devastated southern Brazil twice as likely, a team of international scientists said on Monday, adding that the heavy rains were also intensified by the natural El Nino phenomenon. More than 170 people were killed and nearly 580,000 displaced after storms and floods battered Brazil's southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul last month, with local authorities describing it as the worst disaster in the region's history.\n\nFactbox-Who are the first astronauts to fly aboard Boeing's Starliner?\n\nTwo veteran NASA astronauts with 500 days of previous spaceflight experience between them are the first crew of Boeing's pxpCST-100 Starliner space capsule, launched to space in a test flight on Wednesday from Florida. Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams are set to test Starliner's manual controls before it docks with the International Space Station (ISS) in orbit on Thursday. Both will be arriving at the ISS for the third time.\n\nSpace janitor startup Astroscale jumps 51% in Tokyo debut\n\nShares of Japanese space junk removal startup Astroscale Holdings rose 51% in their debut on Tokyo's growth market on Wednesday. The stock first traded at 1,281 yen per share, compared with an initial public offering (IPO) price of 850 yen, valuing the company at 145 billion yen ($934 million).\n\nBoeing's Starliner capsule launched on first crewed space flight after several delays\n\nBoeing's new Starliner astronaut capsule was launched from Florida on Wednesday in a first test flight carrying a crew, after several delays caused by last-minute technical problems. The CST-100 Starliner, with two astronauts aboard, lifted off from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, strapped to an Atlas V rocket furnished and flown by the Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA).\n\nCarrying lunar rocks, Chinese probe lifts off from far side of moon\n\nChina's Chang'e-6 probe has lifted off from the far side of the moon, starting its journey back towards Earth, China's national space agency announced on Tuesday. The probe's successful departure from the moon means China is closer to becoming the first country to return samples from the far side of the moon, which permanently faces away from Earth.\n\nRare fossil of adolescent Tyrannosaurus - 'Teen Rex'- found by US kids\n\nA rare fossil of an adolescent Tyrannosaurus rex has been excavated in North Dakota's badlands - a find noteworthy for the scientific insight it may offer into the life history of this famous dinosaur and for the tale of the kids who found it. The discovery of the fossil, nicknamed \"Teen Rex,\" was announced on Tuesday by the Denver Museum of Nature & Science, where it will be studied and displayed.\n\nSpaceX's next Starship rocket test gets FAA go-ahead\n\nThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Tuesday said it issued a license for SpaceX's fourth flight of its Starship rocket system, another test mission along the company's path to building a reusable satellite launcher and moon lander. SpaceX, owned by Elon Musk, is aiming to launch its nearly 400-foot-tall (122-meter), two-stage Starship as early as Thursday at 7 a.m. CDT (1200 GMT) from its rocket facilities in south Texas, from which past flights in the company's test-to-failure development campaign have launched.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_6", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ariane 6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Desert", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atacama Desert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_C._Rubin_Observatory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vera C.

Williams, a veteran of two other space missions, previously told reporters that she brings some essentials including sacred texts Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita and, of course, samosas.\n\n\"I really appreciate my Indian heritage and was glad I could bring part of it with me to space,\" Williams said during a 2013 news conference at the National Science Centre in Delhi, before referencing the elephant-headed Hindu god. \"Ganesh has always been in my house. Everywhere I've lived, I've had Ganesh, and so he had to come with me to space, of course. And Indian food -- you can never get enough of Indian food ... so I had to make sure I had some samosas in space with me. Other types of Indian food we definitely had up there as well.\"\n\nWilliams, whose father is Indian and mother is of Slovenian descent, has been open about the importance of her heritage. While on Expedition 32/33 in 2012, she also sent out a greeting from space during Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights.\n\nNASA selected Williams as an astronaut in 1998. She has spent a total of 322 days and performed seven space walks across her two extended missions in space.

Carried outside the planet's atmosphere by a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket, the ship is now circling our world as it gets ready to dock with the International Space Station (ISS). Starliner departed the Space Launch Complex-41 pad at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 10:52 AM EDT, carrying with it two American astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. They both safely reached orbit shortly after.\n\nThe last update we got from Boeing regarding the state of the ship and crew was about five hours ago from the time of writing. Mission controllers informed us that the two NASA astronauts have entered their sleep period, which is scheduled to end a few hours from now, at 4.30 AM EDT.\n\nBefore tucking themselves in, the two performed a series of tests on the Starliner spaceship, including by manually piloting it. For about a couple of hours or so, the crew used a hand controller to point and aim the spacecraft, and the initial results seem to be very satisfying: the Starliner controls great, even better than in the simulator.\n\nA far-field demo was also conducted, with the ship pointed toward the Earth. This maneuver allowed the communications antenna to be pointed at Tracking and Data Relay Satellites (TDRS). Then, the solar array was positioned to point at the Sun, in case the internal batteries need to be charged.\n\nAfter being pointed at Earth, the ship was spun around to face the stars. This move allowed the \"star trackers in the VESTA system to establish their attitude in space in case all three flight computers were to ever go out or be turned off at the same time.\"\n\nSome acceleration and deceleration maneuvers were also conducted to raise and lower the ship's orbit. This test was a rehearsal for the unlikely scenario that the crew needs to manually break away from the space station orbit during rendezvous, if such a thing were to become necessary.\n\nThe final test had the ship position for re-entry, a practice run that may come in handy if an emergency would require such a maneuver.\n\nThe Starliner is scheduled to dock with the ISS later on June 6, and NASA promises more manual piloting skills will be demonstrated at that time. The estimated time of the ship's arrival at the Harmony module is 12:15 PM EDT.\n\nStarliner's stay in space is scheduled to last about a week. In the days to follow, the crew will give the world a tour of the Starliner (June 8), speak to the students from Sunita L. Williams Elementary School in Needham, Massachusetts, (June 10), and then do the same with students from Tennessee Tech University (June 11).", "source": {"uri": "autoevolution.com", "dataType":

This historic flight marked the first crewed mission aboard Starliner, showcasing its operational readiness and manual controls during various orbital tests.\n\nIn a groundbreaking mission, Indian-origin astronaut Sunita Williams and her colleague Butch Wilmore tested the unique manual piloting capabilities of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft while en route to the International Space Station (ISS). This mission, Williams' third spaceflight, marked a historical milestone as the first crewed journey aboard the Starliner.\n\nDespite the spacecraft's usual autonomous operations, the crew meticulously demonstrated manual controls during a 25-hour flight, including pointing Starliner's nose toward Earth to align with Tracking and Data Relay satellites for communication. The astronauts also adjusted the spacecraft's orientation to ensure optimal solar charging and demonstrated the ability to manually alter orbits and navigate by star trackers.\n\nThis mission is critical for Boeing, as the Starliner has faced numerous delays and technical issues, including a failed uncrewed test flight in 2019. The success of this manual piloting test elevates the spacecraft's credibility and marks a significant achievement for NASA's commercial crew program.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_tracker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star tracker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/06_06_2024_10_03_55_2751784.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

They will spend just over a week at the orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.\n\n\"Let's get going!\" Wilmore called out a few minutes before liftoff.\n\nHalf an hour later, he and Williams were safely in orbit and chasing after the space station. Back at Cape Canaveral, relieved launch controllers stood and applauded. After all the trouble leading up to Wednesday's launch, including two scrapped countdowns, everything went smoothly before and during liftoff, prompting congratulations from SpaceX's Elon Musk and others.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the capsule.\n\nWednesday's launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last weekend. A helium leak in the spacecraft's propulsion system also caused delays.\n\nBoeing was hired alongside Musk's SpaceX a decade ago to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted two competing U.S.companies for the job in the wake of the space shuttles' retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver station supplies.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and

Early today, the space agency announced the detection of two more helium leaks in the spacecraft, adding to a previously identified leak in May that was deemed acceptable before launch. \"Teams have identified three helium leaks on the spacecraft. One of these was previously discussed before flight along with a management plan,\" NASA stated in a post.\n\nAstronauts Barry Willmore and Sunita Williams were alerted by mission control about the need to close two valves due to the newly detected helium leaks. \"Looks like we picked up a couple more helium leaks,\" mission control communicated, guiding them through the valve shutdown process. Despite this issue cutting an hour from their nine-hour rest period, NASA and Boeing have confirmed that the crew is safe and instructed them to sleep while data analysis continues.\n\nDespite the helium leaks, Starliner's voyage toward the ISS continues with its crew currently resting, according to a post by NASA's Johnson Space Center. The spacecraft was launched atop an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida on Wednesday. The mission, known as Crew Flight Test, marked the first time that the spacecraft carried a crew to space as part of Boeing's efforts to develop SpaceX's rival under NASA's Commercial Crew Program.\n\nThe flight marks only the sixth inaugural journey of a crewed spacecraft in US history, as noted by NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \"It started with Mercury, then with Gemini, then with Apollo, the space shuttle, then (SpaceX's) Dragon -- and now Starliner,\" Nelson said. Williams also made history as the first woman to fly aboard such a mission. After reaching the space station, Williams and Wilmore are expected to spend about eight days living in the orbiting laboratory.\n\nPrevious crewed launch attempts on May 6 and June 1 were cancelled due to various issues including a valve issue on the second stage of the Atlas V and a small helium leak within the spacecraft service module. During Wednesday's launch countdown, mission specialists monitored this leak and reported no issues. However, an automatic hold was triggered just three minutes and 50 seconds from liftoff on Saturday afternoon due to an issue with ground support equipment.\n\nAfter the automatic hold was triggered, engineers assessed the ground support equipment over the weekend and isolated the issue to a single ground power supply within one of the computers responsible for key countdown events. The faulty computer was subsequently replaced with a spare. This successful troubleshooting allowed for Starliner's historic launch, marking a significant milestone for Boeing.\n\nDespite the helium leaks, Boeing aerospace engineer Brandon Burroughs assured that the crew is safe. \"We have some issues to watch overnight when in regards to the helium leaks that was just brought up, and we have a lot of smart people down here on the ground that are going to take a look at this stuff and keep an eye on it, but the vehicle is in a configuration right now where they're safe to fly,\" said Burroughs.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_control_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mission control center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrator_of_NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Administrator of NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Johnson Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mercury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Project Mercury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gemini", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Project Gemini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apollo program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_specialist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mission specialist"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/27141991717661691.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "dateEnd": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 1949, "textEnd": 1965}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

If all goes according to plan on CFT, Starliner will be certified to fly operational, long-duration crewed missions to and from the orbiting lab for NASA.\n\nSpaceX already does this for the agency with its Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon capsule. Elon Musk's company is in the middle of its eighth contracted astronaut mission to the ISS for NASA, which is known as Crew-8.\n\nCFT was originally supposed to launch on May 6, but that try was scrubbed about two hours before liftoff when team members noticed a misbehaving valve in the upper stage of Starliner's United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket.\n\nULA decided to replace the valve, pushing the target launch date back to May 17. The timeline shifted further to the right after a helium leak was detected in one of Starliner's reaction-control thrusters. The launch team ultimately deemed the leak a minor issue and cleared CFT for a June 1 liftoff.

With a clean countdown, ULA's Atlas V successfully delivered Starliner to space, however, two additional helium leaks have been found while in orbit, but docking is planned to continue unchanged.\n\nFor the first time since Apollo 7, Cape Canaveral Space Force Station launched a crewed flight from its side of the Florida spaceport. Lifting off from SLC-41, a first for this pad as well, the Atlas V performed as expected and deposited Starliner into its just-shy-of-orbit trajectory.\n\nThis was the third launch attempt to launch Starliner on its first crewed mission and final test flight. The first launch attempts scrubbed due to issues with the ULA Atlas V rocket, however, the month long delay from the first attempt until today was due to issues with the capsule's propulsion system.\n\nThe years of extra time to train and prepare for the mission paid off as each time Wilmore, Williams, and the Boeing/ULA crew that helped them enter the capsule did their jobs flawlessly.\n\nLiftoff took place at 10:52 A.M. ET on top of an Atlas V N22 rocket. The N stands for \"no payload fairing and the 2s are for the number of solid rocket motors and Centaur RL10 engines respectively. As expected, the Atlas performed perfectly, continuing its high success rate. Starliner CFT was also a return to human spaceflight for the Atlas family, last lifting crew on Mercury-Atlas 9 (Gordon Cooper in Faith 7).\n\nSeveral hours into the flight, controllers notified Wilmore and Williams that two additional helium leaks have been found in manifolds on Starliner's service module.\n\nA single leak on a port side manifold was found after the first launch scrub on May 6. This, and a review of Starliner's entire propulsion system, was the reason for the month delay in launching. Only a few days of that delay were due to issues with the Atlas V. This leak was determined safe for this mission and a permanent fix would be implemented on future missions.\n\nNow in space, two more leaks have sprung up on two separate manifolds, another port side one and a top side manifold. Piping to all three manifolds were shutoff overnight as they worked the issue.\n\nNASA or Boeing haven't released specifics on the leaks, like any rates, but it seems to have been determined fine for continuing Starliner's mission of docking with the ISS. Two of the manifolds were reopened ahead of various burns, as shutting them down also shuts down several thrusters. The third manifold which has the highest level of leakage won't be reopened until closer to docking.\n\nStarliner's docking is planned to take place at 12:15 P.M. ET on the forward port of the ISS's harmony module.

One helium leak had been discovered prior to launch and deemed acceptable.\n\n\"Teams have identified three helium leaks on the spacecraft.

NASA reported it knew about one helium leak before launch, but two more became known post launch.\n\nAstronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams rocketed into space at 10:52am EDT on Wednesday, after two prior delays caused them to have to exit the Starliner spacecraft before launch. Approximately fifteen minutes after blastoff, Starliner released from the Atlas V's Centaur upper stage, on target to reach the International Space Station (ISS) about 26 hours later. Even with all the success, Starliner was not without issues.\n\nNASA's Johnson Space Center reported on X, \"Teams have identified three helium leaks on the spacecraft. One of these was previously discussed before flight along with a management plan.\" The post explained two new leaks appeared post launch, adding, \"Two of the affected helium valves have been closed and the spacecraft remains stable.\"\n\nThe new leaks were spotted just as the two astronauts began preparing for an overnight sleep shift ahead of the upcoming docking at ISS. While the previously known leak traced back to a flange in one manifold on the left-side doghouse pod, another became evident on the right-side of the same doghouse, along with another in the doghouse on the top-side of the service module. The spacecraft houses four doghouse-shaped propulsion pods, all with lines for hydrazine fuel, nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer, and helium pressurant routed into thruster packs.\n\nBoeing engineer Brandon Burroughs described the two new helium leaks as \"small\" during a post-launch broadcast on NASA TV. He added the leaks did not appear during troubleshooting of the previously known leak before launch. This means that three of Starliner's eight helium manifolds are showing signs of leakage.\n\nThe ground crew reported to Wilmore it would isolate the manifolds newly discovered to be leaking helium, while keeping the manifold previously known to be leaking helium open.\n\nSteve Stitch, NASA's commercial crew program manager, remarked about the known leaks, \"It's a tough system. This is a high-pressure system, and helium is a very small, tiny molecule, and it tends to leak.\"\n\nAs of right now, the mission is still on target to dock with ISS at approximately 12:15pm ET today. NASA posted on X teams will continue to monitor \"the vehicle's status and continue monitoring manifold leak rates.\" Burroughs added, \"This was unexpected, and we plan for cases like this.\"", "source": {"uri": "hothardware.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotHardware"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_sweezy@hothardware.com", "name": "Tim Sweezy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_(rocket_stage)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centaur (rocket stage)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Johnson Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASA TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrazine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hydrazine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinitrogen_tetroxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dinitrogen tetroxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidizing_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oxidizing agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric pressure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Molecule"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://images.hothardware.com/contentimages/newsitem/64729/content/hero-boeing-starliner-launch.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628370", "eventUri": "eng-9628370", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

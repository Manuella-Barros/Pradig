The attack resulted in the deaths of at least four individuals, according to Iraqi sources.\n\nThe airstrike marks the first such action by US forces in Iraq since February when a pro-Iran commander involved in assaults on US troops was killed. \"Tonight, US forces in Iraq conducted a defensive airstrike targeting combatants attempting to launch one-way attack uncrewed aerial systems,\" stated a US defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The Central Command assessed that the drones posed a significant threat to US and coalition forces.\n\nThe official emphasized, \"We maintain the inherent right to self-defense and will not hesitate to take appropriate action.\"\n\nThe Hashed al-Shaabi, an alliance of pro-Iran former paramilitary groups now integrated into Iraq's security forces, reported that the missile strikes left four people dead at a base in Babylon. However, they did not mention any attempt to launch drones from the ground. \"Available information suggests that two patrols were targeted with missiles fired from drones,\" the Hashed said in a statement.\n\nAn official from the alliance informed AFP that \"four people were killed and others were critically wounded in blasts that hit a base belonging to the Hashed al-Shaabi.\" A security source confirmed the fatalities, adding that the death toll could rise.\n\nRecent attacks have targeted US and allied forces in Iraq, including several rockets launched toward the Ain al-Assad base last week, which hosts troops from the US-led coalition against the Islamic State jihadist group. On July 16, two drones were launched toward the same facility, with one being destroyed and another causing minimal damage.\n\nPrior to these incidents, US troops in Iraq and Syria had not faced attacks since April. However, during the initial months of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, they were targeted over 175 times. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a coalition of Iran-backed groups, claimed the majority of these attacks in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nIn January, a drone strike attributed to these groups killed three US soldiers at a base in Jordan. In retaliation, US forces conducted dozens of strikes against Tehran-backed fighters. Since then, the frequency of attacks against US troops has significantly decreased.\n\nBaghdad has been actively working to defuse tensions, engaging in discussions with Washington regarding the future of the US-led coalition's mission in Iraq. The US military currently maintains approximately 2,500 troops in Iraq and 900 in Syria, deployed at the Iraqi government's request in 2014 to combat the Islamic State group, which had seized large

Therefore, we hold the coalition forces fully responsible for these consequences.\"\n\nKataeb Hezbollah, a powerful pro-Iran group and part of the Hashed al-Shaabi, said the US strike targeted a \"group of drone experts who were carrying out new tests\" to improve their surveillance drones.\n\nThe group added in a statement that it intended to use the surveillance drones to support Iraqi security forces next month during the Arbaeen commemoration -- one of the biggest Shiite religious events which marks the 40th day of mourning for Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed.\n\nIt also said \"it would make the appropriate decision after consulting\" with other groups, and urged the Iraqi government to \"end the occupation\" -- referring to the presence of US forces in Iraq.\n\nKataeb Hezbollah is also part of the Islamic Resistance of Iraq, a loose alliance of pro-Iran groups that had claimed attacks on US troops, most recently over the Gaza war, before suspending them in late January.\n\nThe United States considers Kataeb Hezbollah a \"terrorist\" group and has repeatedly targeted it.\n\nThere have been two recent attacks targeting US and allied forces in Iraq.\n\nSeveral rockets were launched toward Ain al-Assad base last week, which hosts troops form the US-led coalition against the Islamic State jihadist group, officials said.\n\nAnd on July 16, two drones were launched toward the same facility, one of which was \"successfully destroyed\" while another hit the base, causing \"minimal damage,\" according to the Pentagon.\n\nPrior to that, US troops in Iraq and Syria had not been targeted since April. But attacks against them were much more common in the first few months of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, when they were targeted more than 175 times.\n\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed the majority of the attacks, saying they were in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nIn January, a drone strike blamed on those groups killed three US soldiers at a base in Jordan. In retaliation, US forces launched dozens of strikes against Tehran-backed fighters in Iraq and Syria.\n\nSince then, attacks against US troops have largely halted.\n\nBaghdad has sought to defuse tensions, engaging in talks with Washington on the future of the US-led coalition's mission in Iraq, with Iran-backed groups demanding a withdrawal.\n\nThe US military has around 2,500 troops in Iraq and 900 in Syria.\n\nThe coalition was deployed to Iraq at the government's request in 2014 to help combat the Islamic State group, which had taken over vast swathes of Iraq and neighboring

This strike, reported by Iraqi sources to have resulted in at least four deaths, is the first by American forces in Iraq since February. During that prior incident, the US military claimed to have killed a pro-Iran commander involved in attacks on US troops.\n\n\"Tonight, US forces in Iraq conducted a defensive air strike in Babylon province, targeting combatants attempting to launch one-way attack uncrewed aerial systems,\" a US defense official was quoted as saying.The Central Command evaluated that the drones \"posed a threat to US and coalition forces.\" The official added, \"We maintain the inherent right to self-defense and will not hesitate to take appropriate action.\"\n\nThe Hashed al-Shaabi, an alliance of pro-Iran former paramilitary groups integrated into Iraq's security forces, reported that apparent missile strikes had killed four people at a base in Babylon. However, they did not mention any drone launch attempts. \"Available information suggests that two patrols were targeted with missiles fired from drones,\" the Hashed said in a statement.\n\nAn official from the Hashed al-Shaabi was quoted as saying that \"four people were killed and others were critically wounded in blasts that hit a base belonging to the Hashed al-Shaabi.\" A security source confirmed the four deaths and noted that the death toll could rise.\n\nThis air strike follows two recent attacks targeting US and allied forces in Iraq. Last week, several rockets were launched toward the Ain al-Assad base, which hosts US-led coalition troops combating the Islamic State group. On July 16, two drones were launched toward the same facility; one was \"successfully destroyed,\" while the other caused \"minimal damage,\" according to the Pentagon.\n\nUS troops in Iraq and Syria had not been targeted since April before these recent incidents. However, attacks were frequent during the initial months of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, with more than 175 attacks reported. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of Iran-backed groups, claimed most of these attacks, citing solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nIn January, a drone strike blamed on these groups killed three US soldiers at a base in Jordan. In retaliation, US forces launched dozens of strikes against Tehran-backed fighters. Since then, attacks on US troops have significantly decreased.\n\nBaghdad has been engaging in talks with Washington to defuse tensions and discuss the future of the US-led coalition's mission in Iraq. The US military maintains approximately 2,500 troops in Iraq and 900 in Syria. The coalition was initially deployed to Iraq at the government's request in 2014 to help combat the Islamic State group, which had taken over large swathes of Iraq and Syria. Despite the coalition's efforts, IS remnants continue to carry out attacks and ambushes in both countries.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

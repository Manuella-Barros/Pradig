In this stunning image of the Serpens Nebula, the discovery lies in the northern area of this young, nearby star-forming region.\n\nThe astronomers found an intriguing group of protostellar outflows, formed when jets of gas spewing from newborn stars collide with nearby gas and dust at high speeds. Typically, these objects have a variety of orientations within one region. Here, however, they are all slanted in the same direction, to the same degree, like sleet pouring down during a storm.\n\nThe discovery of these aligned objects, made possible only by Webb's exquisite spatial resolution and sensitivity at near-infrared wavelengths, is providing information about the fundamentals of how stars are born.\n\nSo, just how does the alignment of the stellar jets relate to the rotation of the star? As an interstellar gas cloud collapses in on itself to form a star, it spins more rapidly. The only way for the gas to continue moving inward is for some of the spin (known as angular momentum) to be removed.\n\nA disk of material forms around the young star to transport material down, like a whirlpool around a drain. The swirling magnetic fields in the inner disk launch some of the material into twin jets that shoot outward in opposite directions, perpendicular to the disk of material.\n\nIn the Webb image, these jets are identified by bright red clumpy streaks, which are shockwaves caused when the jet hits the surrounding gas and dust. Here, the red color indicates the presence of molecular hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Webb can image these extremely young stars and their outflows, which were previously obstructed at optical wavelengths.\n\nAstronomers say there are a few forces that potentially can shift the direction of the outflows during this period of a young star's life. One way is when binary stars spin around each other and wobble in orientation, twisting the direction of the outflows over time.\n\nThe Serpens Nebula is only one or two million years old, which is very young in cosmic terms. It's also home to a particularly dense cluster of newly forming stars (around 100 000 years old) at the center of this image, some of which will eventually grow to the mass of our sun.\n\nSerpens is a reflection nebula, which means it's a cloud of gas and dust that does not create its own light but instead shines by reflecting the light from stars close to or within the nebula.\n\nSo, throughout the region in this image, filaments and wisps of different hues represent reflected starlight from still-forming protostars within the cloud. In some areas there is dust in front of that reflection, which appears here in an orange, diffuse shade.\n\nThis region has been home to other coincidental discoveries, including the flapping \"Bat Shadow,\" which earned its name when 2020 data from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope revealed it to flap, or shift.

This spinning causes a disc of dust and gas to form around the young star at the centre of the cloud, feeding material into the cloud itself.\n\nThe powerful magnetic fields in the disc then create jets of material that blast away from the star along its spin axis, so we can use these jets to measure the direction of a young star's spin.

Unlike some other nebulae, which are illuminated by radiation from stars that causes them to glow, this is a type called a reflection nebula, so it only shines due to the light that reflects from other sources.\n\nAs well as being visually striking, this image is also helping astronomers to learn about a special phenomenon related to newborn stars. When stars are first forming, they start as objects called protostars, and these protostars can give off extremely energetic jets of gas, which comes streaming off their north and south poles.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhen this gas streaming off the protostar collides with nearby dust and gas, it creates shockwaves, which can be seen in the top left of the image. The red streaks of molecular hydrogen indicate these outflows, and one immediately noticeable thing about them is that they are all slanted at the same angle. This is the first time this phenomenon of aligned jets has been observed.\n\nNormally, you would expect that a bunch of protostars would have outflows going in all different directions. So the fact these are all aligned suggests that there is something special going on in this region, which is affecting these young stars.\n\n\"Astronomers say there are a few forces that potentially can shift the direction of the outflows during this period of a young star's life,\" Webb scientists explain. \"One way is when binary stars spin around each other and wobble in orientation, twisting the direction of the outflows over time.\"\n\nTo learn more about the region, Webb scientists plan to use Webb's NIRSpec instrument to understand what the cloud is made of, in addition to this data from Webb's NIRCam instrument that was used to capture this image.\n\nEditors' Recommendations Well-known star turns out to be not one star, but twins Stunning images of Jupiter's moon Europa show it has a floating icy shell James Webb observes extremely hot exoplanet with 5,000 mph winds Celebrate Hubble's 34th birthday with this gorgeous nebula image James Webb images capture the galactic winds of newborn stars", "source": {"uri": "digitaltrends.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Trends"}, "authors": [{"uri": "georgina_torbet@digitaltrends.com", "name": "Georgina Torbet", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protostar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Protostar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star formation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nebula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_nebula", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reflection nebula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serpens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronomer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radiation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Webb Space Telescope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shock wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIRCam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NIRCam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exoplanet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europa (moon)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Binary star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rotation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jupiter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Amateur", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Images", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Images", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Interstellar_Medium", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Interstellar Medium", "wgt": 23}], "image": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/weic2415c1.jpg?resize=800%2C418&p=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669109", "eventUri": "eng-9669109", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 456620534, "relevance": 2}

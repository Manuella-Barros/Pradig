The former Chelsea technical director believes that the midfielder's departure froom Al-Ettifaq was damaging on a personal level after just a matter of months in the Middle East. Emenalo admitted he was unable to convince Henderson to remain in Saudi Arabia rather than complete a transfer to Ajax. Henderson drew widespread criticism when making the move to Al-Ettifaq from Liverpool last summer. Arriving in a \u00a312million deal with wages of \u00a3350,000-a-week, the 33-year-old stood accused of betraying what he stood for as an ambassador for LGBTQ rights. At the time of his switch to Ajax, Henderson described his second move within six months as a 'football decision'. Emenalo suggests it was more complicated than that, but hinted aspirations for his England career could have played a factor - ultimately Henderson was not named in Gareth Southgate's preliminary squad. Emenalo told the Telegraph: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t damaging at all for the league. It was damaging on a personal level because this is someone that we all admired and we tried our very best to help him adapt and to stay. \u201cBut sometimes these things are just beyond your own needs and just beyond professional. Jordan did a lot of good work here, did a lot of good work for Ettifaq and had inputs in ideas that have transformed that club and had an opportunity to know the country and the culture. \u201cIf you ask him privately now, he will tell you that he had no issues. But sometimes there is a confluence of things happening that makes individuals make a decision that I think is best for them. \u201cI felt that is a guy who\u2019s an ultra-professional and who had built a career, a magnificent, magnificent career through becoming Liverpool captain, England captain and maybe to, in his mind, he had an idea of how he wanted to finish. \u201cAnd maybe at some point in the course of the season he just felt that he is not going to get that. That\u2019s something that you have to respect and it\u2019s not something that I agree with because I really admire him and I had a one-on-one with him to try to [persuade him to stay].\u201d Al-Ettifaq boss Steven Gerrard was disappointed to lose his captain partway through the season. The Liverpool legend also hinted at a combination of England aspirations and Henderson's personal life playing a role. \"I respected his decision because I love him as a guy, I love him as a player and I have nothing but ultimate respect for him,\" said Gerrard. \"If someone has some family things that are affecting him. If someone has got different outside goals or opportunities, like England for example, then I have to respect that and understand it. And I do. But was I disappointed?

But will it really help?", "body": "President Yoon Seok Yeol says he wants to create a new minitry to tackle low birth rates in the country. Reuters\n\nSouth Korea is known around the world for its technological advancements, beauty products, and vibrant K-pop culture.\n\nBut at home, the country is grappling with what could be an existential crisis - the lowest birthrate in the world.\n\nOn Thursday, South Korea's president Yoon Suk Yeol announced that he wants to establish a new ministry to address this looming demographic crisis.\n\n\"I ask the parliament's cooperation to revise government organisation to set up the Ministry of Low Birth Rate Counter Planning,\" Yoon said in a live address to the nation.\n\nThis was Soon's first speech since his crushing defeat in the general election last year.\n\nThe government in February announced that South Korea's birth rate fell to a record low last year.\n\nThis, despite having poured billions of dollars into efforts to encourage women to have more children and stabilise the population.\n\nA looming demographic crisis\n\nAccording to February's preliminary data from Statistics Korea, the country's fertility rate -- the number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime -- dropped to 0.72 in 2023, down nearly 8 per cent from 2022.\n\nThis is far below the 2.1 children needed to maintain the current population of 51 million.\n\nAt this rate, the population will decline to nearly half by 2100, according to experts from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle.\n\nThe country has one of the world's longest life expectancies and lowest birth rates, a combination that presents a massive demographic challenge.\n\nSeoul has thus far poured hundreds of billions of dollars into trying to encourage South Koreans to have more babies, offered cash subsidies, babysitting services, and support for infertility treatment.\n\nHowever, all this has made little difference as the fertility rate continues to plumb new lows.\n\n\"In order to overcome the low birth rate, which can be considered a national emergency, we will fully mobilise all of the state's capabilities,\" Seoul-based Yonhap News Agency quoted Yoon as saying.\n\n\"We will be creating a low-birth planning department in order to establish a more aggressive and powerful control tower,\" Yoon added.\n\nThe South Korean government also made efforts such as increasing paid time off for new fathers, providing \"baby vouchers\" for new parents, and promoting campaigns for men to share household responsibilities.\n\nWill creating a ministry really help?\n\nExperts and locals say deeper societal problems such as bias against single parents, prejudice against non-conventional relationships, and obstacles for same-sex couples are making people think twice before having children.\n\nFactors such as steep expenses related to raising children and housing, as well as a highly competitive job market are also responsible for pushing people away from becoming parents.\n\nA survey by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs (KIHASA) in February of around 300 childless newlyweds showed that 37 per cent of them estimated that the cost of raising a child every month will be between 1 million won (Rs. 61,044) and 1.5 million won (Rs. 91,581), according to The Korea Times.\n\nAsked how much of a burden child-rearing expenses would place on their households, 93.7 per cent said it would be burdensome.\n\nOf those, 58.7 per cent said it would be 'somewhat burdensome' and 35 per cent said it would be 'very burdensome.'\n\nIn the largely conservative Korean society, working mothers face the challenge of balancing household duties, childcare responsibilities, and professional careers, burdening them with child's responsibilities.\n\nSouth Korea's 0.72 birth rate is the lowest among OECD nations, while the average age a woman gives birth is 33.6, the highest in the OECD.\n\nIt looks like nothing short of a change in attitudes and in society will help South Korea solve its demographic crisis.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate", "type":

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nSouth Korea will set up a ministry to address the country's plummeting birth rate, president Yoon Suk Yeol announced on Thursday, calling it a \"national emergency\".\n\nThe fertility rate in South Korea has been severely hit and continues on a dramatic decline in 2023 as women concerned about their careers and the financial cost of raising children are either delayed childbirth or deciding not to have babies.\n\nWomen have cited the heavy emotional and physical burden of raising a child mostly by themselves, lost career opportunities, and the financial cost, setting the first such trend impacting a national demographic globally.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr Yoon said South Korean parliament will be requested for cooperation to set up what he called the \"Ministry of Low Birth Rate Counter-Planning\".\n\n\"We will mobilise all of the nation's capabilities to overcome the low birth rate, which can be considered a national emergency,\" he said, announcing a new policy push.\n\nThe demographic crisis in the country is blamed on a number of factors, but largely Korean couples' frustrations with rising cost of living and declining quality of life have been considered as the primary reasons.\n\nAddressing his first press conference in 21 months, the president pushed for improving the economy performance as he flagged the emergency of declining birth rates the coming three years of his term.\n\n\"I think the important thing going forward is indeed the economy. Corporate growth and job creation are important too but what I think is more important is to try harder to look for what is inconvenient in the life of each and every person and to resolve them,\" the South Korean leader said.\n\nHe was standing behind a plaque which read: \"The Buck Stops Here\".\n\nThe ministry will address the challenges contributing to the record low birth rate and fast-ageing population. \"This is not a matter we can take time to work on,\" he said.\n\nThe South Korean government and policymakers have been striving to find new and innovative measures to address the crisis of dwindling child birth rates. The birth rates in the country dropped to 0.72 babies per woman in a lifetime in 2023, the lowest national birth rate.\n\nUnder the government's scheme to motivate parents, South Korean couples receive financial assistance ranging from 35m won (\u00a320,566) to 50m won (\u00a329,380) through different incentive and support programs from the time of their child's birth until they reach the age of seven.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arpan_rai@independent.co.uk", "name": "Arpan Rai", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Birth rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoon_Suk_Yeol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yoon Suk Yeol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Total fertility rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(South_Korea)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (South Korea)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_South_Korea", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of South Korea"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Pregnancy_and_Birth", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Pregnancy and Birth", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/09/11/GettyImages-906809962.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552123", "eventUri": "eng-9552123", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

At Blanchardstown District Court today Judge David McHugh said, \"This is an appalling series of breaches of the road traffic rules and an appalling episode of dangerous driving.\"\n\nHe imposed a five-month sentence, suspended on condition that McGregor kept the peace for two years, and hit the fighter with fines totalling \u20ac5,000 and a two-year road ban.\n\nREAD MORE: Jake Paul outlines why he thinks Conor McGregor won't fight him\n\nREAD MORE: Daniel Wiffen credits twin brother for Olympic triumph as tears come for Ireland's swimming sensation\n\nHe found that \"remorseful\" McGregor's driving was \"persistent, prolonged and deliberate,\" but noting the mitigating factors and guilty plea, he held that \"It is appropriate to meet this matter by way of a suspended sentence, and only just.\"\n\nGardai pursued the MMA star at 160 km/h and stopped the 36-year-old in west Dublin. He was arrested after being asked at least six times to get out of his 2019-reg car.\n\nHe was initially charged with two counts of dangerous driving car at the N4/M50 interchange in Palmerstown and Lucan Road, being uninsured, having no licence, and failing to produce his documents within ten days.\n\nGardai further charged the father of four with careless driving, a lesser offence, in connection with the incident.\n\nState solicitor Ruth Walsh told Judge McHugh that the insurance and licence charges, and one count of dangerous driving at Lucan Road would now be withdrawn.\n\nHis documents had been produced and were in order, the court heard. Defence counsel David Staunton informed the court McGregor was pleading guilty to the two remaining offences.\n\nThe MMA star, dressed in a blue check three-piece suit, arrived in his Bentley and sat in the public gallery until his case was called. He did not address the court and sat in the dock with his hands clasped throughout the hearing.\n\nOutlining the evidence, Garda Dennis Lorden recalled that he was stopped at traffic lights waiting for them to turn green at the junction of the Lucan Road, R136. He observed McGregor's car travelling on a 24-hour bus lane. \"This vehicle travelled at speed on my inside, went through the red light on the bus corridor\".\n\nIt failed to stop and the garda activated his blue lights and sirens. Garda Lorden followed and saw McGregor merge from the bus lane onto Lucan Road at high speed. He said another vehicle had to stop to avoid crashing into McGregor's car.\n\nThe court heard he continued at high speed on the eastbound bus lane along the N4 \"before crossing from the bus lane, in one movement out in the fast lane.\" \"I was travelling at excess of 160 km/h trying to catch this vehicle,\" garda told the court.\n\nJudge McHugh heard how McGregor tried to undertake a car in the fast lane as it approached the slip road for the M50 southbound. He went from lane to lane at high speed on the slip road, driving from the inside lane to the outer lane over the hash markings as he joined the M50, \"causing dust to rise\".\n\nHe went south on the motorway before \"undertaking another vehicle already on the fast lane\". The garda said he tried to stop him but he refused to pull over at first. Finally, he pulled over into the hard shoulder.\n\n\"I informed the accused to step out of the vehicle, and the driver replied, 'Are you taking the piss? You want me to get out the vehicle, out of the car on the M50?'.\" McGregor had to be told six or seven times to get out of his car. He told the garda, \"Wait, I need my security to catch up.\"\n\nHe also refused to open his door, but the officer reached in and opened it, and he eventually got out to be arrested.\n\nThe garda agreed with Mr Staunton that his patrol car was doing 160 km/h because McGregor was ahead, and he did not catch up fully with him. McGregor was travelling at speed, but traffic slowed him down. \"But then, in between the traffic, he was pulling away from us again.\"\n\nHe agreed that McGregor was cooperative when taken to a Garda station and was found to be negative for intoxicants.\n\nMcGregor had 20 previous convictions, 17 traffic offences, including three speeding offences, two public order charges, and one for assault causing harm between 2011 and 2019. These convictions resulted in fines and a six-month road ban.\n\nThe garda agreed with counsel that McGregor had no dangerous driving convictions. Sentencing, Judge David McHugh said, \"This is an appalling series of breaches of the road traffic rules and an appalling episode of dangerous driving.\"\n\nHe also noted the risk he caused and said the previous convictions were \"noteworthy, to say the least\". Mr Staunton, instructed by solicitor Michael Staines, said the accused was very remorseful and aware of the danger he caused to others and himself.\n\nWhen the judge indicated he was considering \"an outright prison sentence,\" the defence pleaded that jailing was a measure of last resort and that the court had other options. Counsel submitted that his client had businesses, created employment, and assisted his ill father, who was present for the hearing.\n\nHe said his client was apologetic and regretted his actions. On conviction, dangerous driving carries a maximum fine of up to \u20ac5,000 and six months imprisonment. Careless driving carries a maximum \u20ac5,000 penalty but no risk of a prison sentence.\n\nMcGregor previously appeared before the same court in 2017 when he was fined \u20ac400 for speeding.\n\nIn 2019, the millionaire fighter was handed a \u20ac1,000 fine for an unprovoked attack on a man in a Dublin pub. Desmond Keogh, from south-west Dublin, was in the Marble Arch Pub, Benbulben Road, in Drimnagh at about 2.30 pm on April 6, 2019, when he was punched by McGregor, who later apologised.\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

The car drove on the bus lane eastbound on the N4, before crossing the bus lane out onto the fast lane.\n\nGda Lordan said McGregor drove at high speed on the N4, and the garda said he was doing more than 160kph trying to catch the vehicle.\n\nMcGregor tried to undertake a car on the last lane, moving into the middle lane, before moving back out onto the fast lane, the court heard.\n\nHe took the slip road, which has two lanes, to the M50. McGregor took the inside slip lane, moving to the outside lane over the hash markings, and causing dust to rise.\n\nGda Lordan said McGregor drove onto the M50 southbound, moving from the fast lane to undertake a vehicle, before moving back to the fast lane.\n\nThe garda said he tried to stop the vehicle, but the driver refused to pull over. McGregor finally pulled over onto the hard shoulder, he said.\n\nGda Lordan told the driver to get out of the vehicle. McGregor said to him: \"are you taking the piss? You want me to get out of the car, out of the vehicle on the M50?\"\n\nGda Lordan said he asked McGregor six or seven times to get out of the vehicle, and the defendant told him he was waiting because he \"needed his security to catch up\".\n\nThe garda said he eventually opened the car door, and McGregor got out. He was arrested and taken back to the garda station where he was charged.\n\nThe court heard McGregor had 20 previous convictions, mostly for minor road traffic matters.\n\nDefence lawyer David Staunton said that McGregor offered his apology to the court, and he regretted the incident.\n\nMr Staunton said McGregor was acutely aware of the impact his behaviour had on others.\n\nThe defendant was also very, very aware and acknowledged the difficulties driving like that can cause to others.\n\nMr Staunton said the defendant had given back to his community, had a number of businesses and employed a lot of people.\n\nMcGregor's father, who had been ill, was in court to support him, Mr Staunton said.\n\nJudge McHugh said McGregor put his life and the lives of other road users at risk, and he was considering an outright prison sentence due to the nature and degree of dangerous driving.\n\nMr Staunton urged the judge to consider all other options, as prison should be a last resort.\n\nIn all the circumstances, Judge McHugh said he would impose a five month suspended sentence.\n\nMcGregor, wearing a three piece blue check suit, sat in the dock with his hands clasped for the duration of the hearing. He did not address the court.", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

McGregor also faced several other charges stemming from the incident, including driving without insurance and driving without a license, but those charges were withdrawn after McGregor successfully produced the necessary documents.\n\nThis is far from McGregor's first driving incident.

He came third, behind TMC candidate Sayani Ghosh and BJP nominee Dr Anirban Ganguly. Taking to social media, Bhattacharya said, \u201cWill not take a U-turn\u2026 defeated but have not given up.\u201d He then quoted the late Bangladeshi poet Rudra Mohammad Shahidullah, \u201cAr jai hok, polatok noi\u2026 (Whatever it may be\u2026 I\u2019m not a fugitive\u2026)\u201d Bhattacharya said, \u201cWe tried to create an alternative narrative outside the traditional Trinamool-BJP trope by bringing up issues of sustenance throughout this election campaign. The results of the election show that the destructive BJP has declined across the country and the state as well. It is certainly an encouraging development for us. We must now continue to strive to become an alternative force to the TMC\u2026\u201d He then said that they were able to break the Trinamool-BJP binary in the last municipal and panchayat polls but the binary has strengthened again owing to the efforts of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. \u201cWe have a lot of work ahead of us. Trinamool-BJP communal binary should be broken again before the \u201926 (state) polls. We have to go from house to house and talk about life and livelihood,\u201d Bhattacharya added. He flagged the issue of political violence and claimed several party workers were targeted during and after the Lok Sabha polls, and added that the \u201cright to self-defence is enshrined in our country\u2019s Constitution.\u201d The Young Turk also claimed that there were a lot of positives to the election results as well. Bhattacharya said the party\u2019s vote share has increased in six of the seven Assembly segments under the Jadavpur Lok Sabha constituency compared with the 2021 Assembly polls. He also thanked Congress workers for their support during the campaign. Notably, the CPI(M) and the Congress made seat adjustments in West Bengal during the recently concluded Lok Sabha polls. Despite the arrangement, the Congress managed to win only one seat and the Left failed to open its account.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/losing-cpim-jadavpur-srijan-bhattacharya-pens-open-letter-9380233/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/Srijan-Bhattacharya-.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:02:06", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.254}

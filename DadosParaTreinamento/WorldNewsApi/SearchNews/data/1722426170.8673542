{"id": 243301046, "title": "Orana Mid-Western Police use go-karts to steer students away from the criminal justice system", "text": "Most schools reward good student behaviour with certificates that usually end up on the family fridge. At schools in western NSW, kids get to race go-karts. Each week six students from four Dubbo high schools are chosen to get behind the wheel at the Lincoln County Raceway. For good behaviour, class attendance and respecting peers, they're selected to race karts purchased by the Orana Mid-Western Police District. \"It feels like you're an F1 driver,\" Year 8 student Lincoln Clark said. \"I was a bit scared, but when I found out it can't really hurt you, I just put my foot down on the pedal and drove real fast.\" The four-year-old program, unique in the state, is an attempt to put the brakes on youth crime by rewarding good behaviour with a positive experience, especially one that involves police, said Acting Inspector Scott Heckendorf. \"It's very popular,\" he said. \"Every week there's a line-up of kids wanting to do this and schools are happy to come out and participate. \"The kids that do engage with us, you find that you're seeing them down the street and they're stopping and talking to police, asking things like how they get into the police force.\" Community helps accelerate change Community groups are on board with the idea, donating money to local police to purchase four go-karts worth about $5,000 each. But it's not just about a joy ride. Dubbo Kart Club president Frank Cross, who has been volunteering with the program, says it blends fun with valuable life lessons off the track, including a \"perspective on driving\". \"I've had a philosophy for years that all kids, when they leave high school, they should have done at least 12 months in karting,\" he said. \"It just gives them that idea of speed and distance. Braking and coming into a corner, they know when to brake and the speed gives them an idea of judging how fast something's going. \"You're only half an inch off the ground. You might only be going 60km/h but it feels like 100km/h. That's the buzz that's involved.\" In the Far West Orana region, 726 children aged 10 to 17 appeared in court in the year to December, according to the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research. Another 292 were cautioned and 57 attended a youth justice conference. Acting Inspector Heckendorf says the program has led to higher school attendance and improved grades. Lincoln, 14, said he was motivated by seeing his peers chosen for karting. \"A couple of my friends had been picked before and I felt, 'I'm going to crush it',\" he said. \"I'm definitely going to keep trying my hardest to get back doing more go-karting.\"", "summary": "A unique NSW program aims to put the brakes on youth crime by rewarding good behaviour with a positive experience that involves police while passing on valuable life lessons.\u00a0", "url": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-06-29/dubbo-police-go-kart-racing-reward-for-good-student-behaviour/104034284", "image": "https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/dd3c8da50562dca8a90cbc10198127be?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2060&cropW=3663&xPos=0&yPos=691&width=862&height=485", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:11:25", "author": "James Findlay,Zaarkacha Marlan", "authors": ["James Findlay", "Zaarkacha Marlan"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "AU", "sentiment": -0.158}

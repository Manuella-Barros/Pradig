The AGS reported Russian assaults recently had been far more intense in the north-eastern Lyman and Siviersk sectors, with Ukrainian troops counting close to twenty Russian ground attacks \u2013 almost all by small groups of infantry \u2013 in the past 24 hours. Much of the combat, reportedly, was close-in trench fighting in thick forest in the Serebryansky Lis Nature Preserve. Ukrainian defenses held, that report said. On Wednesday, Russian milbloggers reported another round of attacks was in progress and claimed ground gains. According to a May 28 statement by Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Emergency Situations, one forest fire sparked by fighting had set 120 square hectares of woods and wetland aflame. Firefighters were on the scene but controlling the fire was complicated by combat taking place nearby, the statement said. Heavy combat and dozens of glider bomb strikes were reported across the eastern Donbas sector where Russian and Ukrainian troops have faced off for weeks and in some cases months. Most Russian assaults according to official Ukrainian sources were in farmland between the cities of Avdiivka and Pokrovsk, with 25 ground attacks launched in the past 24 hours and limited Russian advances near the village Ocheretyne, the AGS said. According to Ukrainian milbloggers and public information platforms for Ukraine\u2019s 47th Mechanized Infantry Brigade, the backbone formation of Kyiv defenses in the sector, the unit launched local counterattacks using US-made Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles, recovering positions near the village of Krasnohorivka. Video published on May 27-29 by Strike Drones Company, a UAV outfit attached to 47th Brigade, showed images of Ukrainian quadcopters destroying a Russian tank, blowing up a Russian artillery piece, and dropping mines behind an advancing armored column. One of the videos was geo-located to the Krasnohorivka sector but was not possible to confirm the day it was recorded, Kyiv Post researchers found. In recent battles the 47th has used American Bradleys effectively. In the nearby Chasiv Yar/Bakhmut sector, reports from both sides told of heavy fighting, particularly along sections of a 30-meter-wide irrigation canal forming the main north-south water barrier in the region. Video published on May 28th by 225th Battalion 127th Territorial Defense Brigade, a local defense unit transferred from north Ukraine to help defend Chasiv Yar, showed at least eight Russian tanks and armored personnel carriers advancing towards Ukrainian positions and getting hit first with howitzer and mortar strikes, and then FPV drones. Video published by Kraken, a Kharkiv-based National Guard outfit recruited mostly from retirees from commando units in Ukraine\u2019s military and police, showed late-model Russian T-90M and T-72B3M tanks halted by artillery and then set afire by drones in combat geo-located to the Chasiv Yar sector. Reports credited the Black Swan attack drone company for the kills. Other Kraken media claimed follow-up patrols captured surviving Russian crewmembers. Individual fighter video also placed elements of the International Legion, an infantry formation recruited from volunteers with experience in Western armies, in combat in the area.", "summary": "Ukraine is countering with drone swarms, artillery strikes, and local counterattacks by elite infantry units.

Erik ten Hag remains manager of the Red Devils after winning the FA Cup in the final game of the season, stunning Manchester City at Wembley to lift the trophy. It was a remarkable highlight in an otherwise pretty dreadful campaign, which saw Manchester United finish eighth in the Premier League and bottom of their Champions League group. Ratcliffe is clearly considering the Dutchman\u2019s future and Tuchel is in the frame to replace him after leaving his post as Bayern Munich manager at the end of the season. German publication BILD report that a meeting took place between Ratcliffe and the former Chelsea boss last Tuesday in Monaco. Tuchel was making something of a pitch to the billionaire, with the report stating that he laid out his plans if he were to take over from Ten Hag. This included how he intends to get the best out of under-performers like Jadon Sancho and Mason Mount. Jim Ratcliffe has already made big changes since buying into Manchester United (Picture: Getty Images) Sancho spent the second half of the season on loan at Borussia Dortmund, playing regularly as the German side reached the Champions League final. The England winger is set to return to Old Trafford but under Ten Hag he does not appear to have a future at the club, although Tuchel would hope to turn things around for him. Mount arrived from Chelsea in a \u00a360m deal last summer and has had an almost entirely forgettable first campaign with the Red Devils, struggling with injury, but also failing to make much of an impact at all when he has been on the pitch. Tuchel reportedly used Antonio Rudiger as an example of a player with great potential who was not quit fulfilling it, that he managed to get the best out of during his time at Chelsea.

The military ordered an evacuation of much of Khan Younis in early July. The vast majority of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people has been displaced in the war, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps.\n\nOthers have remained in their homes despite being ordered to leave, saying nowhere in the isolated coastal territory feels safe.\n\nIsrael will 'no longer facilitate Norwegian diplomats to work in Palestine,' Norway's foreign minister says\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said Thursday that the Scandinavian government was told that Israel \"will no longer facilitate Norwegian diplomats to work in Palestine.\"\n\n\"This is an extreme act that primarily affects our ability to help the Palestinian population,\" Barth Eide said, adding that it showed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government \"actively opposes the work for a two-state solution.\"\n\nHe said at a news conference that it meant that Norway can no longer work from its representations in the occupied territories. Its representation in the West Bank town of Al Ram was opened in 1995.\n\nThursday's decision will have consequences for Norway's relationship with the Israeli government and they are considering the next steps, he said.\n\nIn May, Norway -- together with Spain and Ireland -- announced they would recognize a Palestinian state.\n\nRights group says Israeli soldiers killed at least 7 people sheltering in a Gaza City home\n\nJERUSALEM -- Human Rights Watch says Israeli soldiers killed at least seven people and severely wounded two, including a 5-year-old, when they attacked a home in Gaza City where a Palestinian family was sheltering in December.\n\nThe New York-based rights group released a report Thursday based on interviews with two members of the al-Khalidi family who witnessed the attack, and video footage released by the Israeli military that placed forces in the vicinity of the home at the time.\n\nThe family members said there were no militants or weapons inside the house, and that the family had no connection to any armed group.

Khan Younis, Gaza's second-largest city, suffered widespread destruction during air and ground operations earlier this year.\n\nIsraeli forces have repeatedly returned to heavily destroyed areas of Gaza where they had fought earlier battles against Hamas and other militants since the start of the 10-month-old war.\n\nGaza faces a severe humanitarian crisis with Israeli restrictions on aid and ongoing fighting limiting access to crucial medical, food and other supplies. The Health Ministry says the death toll in the territory is nearing 40,000.\n\nRegional tensions have soared since Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed July 31 in Iran by a presumed Israeli strike. Retaliation has been expected. French President Emmanuel Macron beseeched Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in a phone call to do everything in his power to avoid a new military escalation that he said would do lasting damage to regional stability.\n\nWorld leaders have been pushing for a cease-fire in Gaza, and United States President Joe Biden spoke with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi on Tuesday about their hopes for a deal calming tensions in the Middle East. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his Cabinet over the weekend that Israel is already in a \"multi-front war\" with Iran and its proxies.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nIsraeli military orders another mass evacuation in southern Gaza\n\nJERUSALEM -- The Israeli military has ordered another mass evacuation in southern Gaza, saying its forces will soon operate there in response to Palestinian rocket fire.\n\nThe orders announced Thursday cover large areas in and around Khan Younis, Gaza's second-largest city, which suffered widespread destruction during air and ground operations earlier this year.\n\nAssociated Press video captured loud blasts and smoke rising over the city on Thursday.\n\nIsraeli forces have repeatedly returned to heavily destroyed areas of Gaza where they had fought earlier battles against Hamas and other militants since the start of the 10-month-old war. The military ordered an evacuation of much of Khan Younis in early July. The vast majority of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people has been displaced in the war, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps.\n\nOthers have remained in their homes despite being ordered to leave, saying nowhere in the isolated coastal territory feels safe.\n\nIsrael will 'no longer facilitate Norwegian diplomats to work in Palestine,' Norway's foreign minister says\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said Thursday that the Scandinavian government was told that Israel \"will no longer facilitate Norwegian diplomats to work in Palestine.\"\n\n\"This is an extreme act that primarily affects our ability to help the Palestinian population,\" Barth Eide said, adding that it showed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government \"actively opposes the work for a two-state solution.\"\n\nHe said at a news conference that it meant that Norway can no longer work from its representations in the occupied territories. Its representation in the West Bank town of Al Ram was opened in 1995.\n\nThursday's decision will have consequences for Norway's relationship with the Israeli government and they are considering the next steps, he said.\n\nIn May, Norway -- together with Spain and Ireland -- announced they would recognize a Palestinian state.\n\nRights group says Israeli soldiers killed at least 7 people sheltering in a Gaza City home\n\nJERUSALEM -- Human Rights Watch says Israeli soldiers killed at least seven people and severely wounded two, including a 5-year-old, when they attacked a home in Gaza City where a Palestinian family was sheltering in December.\n\nThe New York-based rights group released a report Thursday based on interviews with two members of the al-Khalidi family who witnessed the attack, and video footage released by the Israeli military that placed forces in the vicinity of the home at the time.\n\nThe family members said there were no militants or weapons inside the house, and that the family had no connection to any armed group. They said the troops barged in without warning, hurling grenades and opening fire.\n\nA pregnant woman was among those killed, and the 5-year-old is being treated for severe injuries in Qatar.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, and Human Rights Watch said the army had not responded to detailed questions sent in July.\n\nIsrael says it tries to avoid harming civilians as it seeks to destroy Hamas following the militant group's Oct. 7 attack into Israel, which triggered the ongoing war. But Israel's relentless aerial bombardment and ground operations have wiped out entire Palestinian families. The International Court of Justice is investigating allegations that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, something Israel has adamantly denied.\n\nSaudi Arabia condemns the killing of Haniyeh in Iran as a 'flagrant violation' of international law\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Saudi Arabia has condemned the targeted killing of a Hamas leader in Tehran as a \"flagrant violation\" of international law.\n\nThe statement issued early Thursday by Deputy Foreign Minister Waleed ElKhereiji came after the Saudi-based Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the largest bloc of Muslim countries, issued a similar statement following a high-level meeting the day before.\n\nIran has vowed to avenge the July 31 explosion that killed Ismail Haniyeh, which was widely blamed on Israel, raising fears of a regional war. Israel has not said whether it was involved.\n\nElKhereiji said the killing of Haniyeh was a \"flagrant violation of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national security of the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as international law and the Charter of the United Nations, and constitutes a threat to regional peace and security.\"\n\nThe statement did not directly blame Israel but referred to Israeli attacks against Palestinians \"inside and outside the Palestinian territories.\"", "source": {"uri": "hjnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald Journal"}, "authors":

The military ordered an evacuation of much of Khan Younis in early July. The vast majority of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people has been displaced in the war, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps.\n\nOthers have remained in their homes despite being ordered to leave, saying nowhere in the isolated coastal territory feels safe.\n\nIsrael will 'no longer facilitate Norwegian diplomats to work in Palestine,' Norway's foreign minister says\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said Thursday that the Scandinavian government was told that Israel \"will no longer facilitate Norwegian diplomats to work in Palestine.\"\n\n\"This is an extreme act that primarily affects our ability to help the Palestinian population,\" Barth Eide said, adding that it showed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government \"actively opposes the work for a two-state solution.\"\n\nHe said at a news conference that it meant that Norway can no longer work from its representations in the occupied territories. Its representation in the West Bank town of Al Ram was opened in 1995.\n\nThursday's decision will have consequences for Norway's relationship with the Israeli government and they are considering the next steps, he said.\n\nIn May, Norway -- together with Spain and Ireland -- announced they would recognize a Palestinian state.\n\nRights group says Israeli soldiers killed at least 7 people sheltering in a Gaza City home\n\nJERUSALEM -- Human Rights Watch says Israeli soldiers killed at least seven people and severely wounded two, including a 5-year-old, when they attacked a home in Gaza City where a Palestinian family was sheltering in December.\n\nThe New York-based rights group released a report Thursday based on interviews with two members of the al-Khalidi family who witnessed the attack, and video footage released by the Israeli military that placed forces in the vicinity of the home at the time.\n\nThe family members said there were no militants or weapons inside the house, and that the family had no connection to any armed group. They said the troops barged in without warning, hurling grenades and opening fire.\n\nA pregnant woman was among those killed, and the 5-year-old is being treated for severe injuries in Qatar.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, and Human Rights Watch said the army had not responded to detailed questions sent in July.\n\nIsrael says it tries to avoid harming civilians as it seeks to destroy Hamas following the militant group's Oct. 7 attack into Israel, which triggered the ongoing war. But Israel's relentless aerial bombardment and ground operations have wiped out entire Palestinian families. The International Court of Justice is investigating allegations that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, something Israel has adamantly denied.\n\nSaudi Arabia condemns the killing of Haniyeh in Iran as a 'flagrant violation' of international law\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Saudi Arabia has condemned the targeted killing of a Hamas leader in Tehran as a \"flagrant violation\" of international law.\n\nThe statement issued early Thursday by Deputy Foreign Minister Waleed ElKhereiji came after the Saudi-based Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the largest bloc of Muslim countries, issued a similar statement following a high-level meeting the day before.\n\nIran has vowed to avenge the July 31 explosion that killed Ismail Haniyeh, which was widely blamed on Israel, raising fears of a regional war. Israel has not said whether it was involved.\n\nElKhereiji said the killing of Haniyeh was a \"flagrant violation of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national security of the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as international law and the Charter of the United Nations, and constitutes a threat to regional peace and security.\"\n\nThe statement did not directly blame Israel but

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his Cabinet over the weekend that Israel is already in a \"multi-front war\" with Iran and its proxies.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nIsraeli strikes on 2 Gaza schools serving as shelters kill at least a dozen people, Palestinian agency says\n\nJERUSALEM -- The Palestinian emergency response agency says Israeli airstrikes on two schools functioning as shelters in Gaza City have killed at least a dozen people, the latest in a string of attacks on Gaza schools that Israel says provide cover to Hamas fighters.\n\nThe Israeli military said it had targeted Hamas \"command and control centers\" hidden within the Zahraa and Abdelfattah Hamouda school compounds in eastern Gaza City. It said it had taken \"numerous steps to mitigate the risk of harming civilians,\" such as by precision munitions, surveillance and intelligence, but did not elaborate on how it had done so.\n\nThe Palestinian Civil Defense, which sent crews to recover bodies from the scene, said that seven people were killed in Zahraa school and five in Abdelfattah Hamouda. It was not clear if any of those killed were militants.\n\nThe latest strikes add to the mounting Palestinian death toll in Gaza, which is now nearing 40,000 according to the the Palestinian Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths.\n\nA recent assessment by the United Nations found that nearly 85% of schools in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged by the war.\n\nIsraeli military orders another mass evacuation in southern Gaza\n\nJERUSALEM -- The Israeli military has ordered another mass evacuation in southern Gaza, saying its forces will soon operate there in response to Palestinian rocket fire.\n\nThe orders announced Thursday cover large areas in and around Khan Younis, Gaza's second-largest city, which suffered widespread destruction during air and ground operations earlier this year.\n\nAssociated Press video captured loud blasts and smoke rising over the city on Thursday.\n\nIsraeli forces have repeatedly returned to heavily destroyed areas of Gaza where they had fought earlier battles against Hamas and other militants since the start of the 10-month-old war. The military ordered an evacuation of much of Khan Younis in early July. The vast majority of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people has been displaced in the war, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps.\n\nOthers have remained in their homes despite being ordered to leave, saying nowhere in the isolated coastal territory feels safe.\n\nIsrael will 'no longer facilitate Norwegian diplomats to work in Palestine,' Norway's foreign minister says\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said Thursday that the Scandinavian government was told that Israel \"will no longer facilitate Norwegian diplomats to work in Palestine.\"\n\n\"This is an extreme act that primarily affects our ability to help the Palestinian population,\" Barth Eide said, adding that it showed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government \"actively opposes the work for a two-state solution.\"\n\nHe said at a news conference that it meant that Norway can no longer work from its representations in the occupied territories. Its representation in the West Bank town of Al Ram was opened in 1995.\n\nThursday's decision will have consequences for Norway's relationship with the Israeli government and they are considering the next steps, he said.\n\nIn May, Norway -- together with Spain and Ireland -- announced they would recognize a Palestinian state.\n\nRights group says Israeli soldiers killed at least 7 people sheltering in a Gaza City home\n\nJERUSALEM -- Human Rights Watch says Israeli soldiers killed at least seven people and severely wounded two, including a 5-year-old, when they attacked a home in Gaza City where a Palestinian family was sheltering in December.\n\nThe New York-based rights group released a report Thursday based on interviews with two members of the al-Khalidi family who witnessed the attack, and video footage released by the Israeli military that placed forces in the vicinity of the home at the time.\n\nThe family members said there were no militants or weapons inside the house, and that the family had no connection to any armed group. They said the troops barged in without warning, hurling grenades and opening fire.\n\nA pregnant woman was among those killed, and the 5-year-old is being treated for severe injuries in Qatar.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, and Human Rights Watch said the army had not responded to detailed questions sent in July.\n\nIsrael says it tries to avoid harming civilians as it seeks to destroy Hamas following the militant group's Oct. 7 attack into Israel, which triggered the ongoing war. But Israel's relentless aerial bombardment and ground operations have wiped out entire Palestinian families. The International Court of Justice is investigating allegations that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, something Israel has adamantly denied.\n\nSaudi Arabia condemns the killing of Haniyeh in Iran as a 'flagrant violation' of international law\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Saudi Arabia has condemned the targeted killing of a Hamas leader in Tehran as a \"flagrant violation\" of international law.\n\nThe statement issued early Thursday by Deputy Foreign Minister Waleed ElKhereiji came after the Saudi-based Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the largest bloc of Muslim countries, issued a similar statement following a high-level meeting the day before.\n\nIran has vowed to avenge the July 31 explosion that killed Ismail Haniyeh, which was widely blamed on Israel, raising fears of a regional war. Israel has not said whether it was involved.\n\nElKhereiji said the killing of Haniyeh was a \"flagrant violation of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national security of the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as international law and the Charter of the United Nations, and constitutes a threat to regional peace and security.\"\n\nThe statement did not directly blame Israel but referred to Israeli attacks against Palestinians \"inside and outside the Palestinian territories.\"", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors":

The military ordered an evacuation of much of Khan Younis in early July. The vast majority of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people has been displaced in the war, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps.\n\nOthers have remained in their homes despite being ordered to leave, saying nowhere in the isolated coastal territory feels safe.\n\nIsrael will 'no longer facilitate Norwegian diplomats to work in Palestine,' Norway's foreign minister says\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said Thursday that the Scandinavian government was told that Israel \"will no longer facilitate Norwegian diplomats to work in Palestine.\"\n\n\"This is an extreme act that primarily affects our ability to help the Palestinian population,\" Barth Eide said, adding that it showed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government \"actively opposes the work for a two-state solution.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe said at a news conference that it meant that Norway can no longer work from its representations in the occupied territories. Its representation in the West Bank town of Al Ram was opened in 1995.\n\nThursday's decision will have consequences for Norway's relationship with the Israeli government and they are considering the next steps, he said.\n\nIn May, Norway -- together with Spain and Ireland -- announced they would recognize a Palestinian state.\n\nRights group says Israeli soldiers killed at least 7 people sheltering in a Gaza City home\n\nJERUSALEM -- Human Rights Watch says Israeli soldiers killed at least seven people and severely wounded two, including a 5-year-old, when they attacked a home in Gaza City where a Palestinian family was sheltering in December.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe New York-based rights group released a report Thursday based on interviews with two members of the al-Khalidi family who witnessed the attack, and video footage released by the Israeli military that placed forces in the vicinity of the home at the time.\n\nThe family members said there were no militants or weapons inside the house, and that the family had no connection to any armed group. They said the troops barged in without warning, hurling grenades and opening fire.\n\nA pregnant woman was among those killed, and the 5-year-old is being treated for severe injuries in Qatar.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, and Human Rights Watch said the army had not responded to detailed questions sent in July.\n\nIsrael says it tries to avoid harming civilians as it seeks to destroy Hamas following the militant group's Oct. 7 attack into Israel, which triggered the ongoing war. But Israel's relentless aerial bombardment and ground operations have wiped out entire Palestinian families. The International Court of Justice is investigating allegations that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, something Israel has adamantly denied.\n\nSaudi Arabia condemns the killing of Haniyeh in Iran as a 'flagrant violation' of international law\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Saudi Arabia has condemned the targeted killing of a Hamas leader in Tehran as a \"flagrant violation\" of international law.\n\nThe statement issued early Thursday by Deputy Foreign Minister Waleed ElKhereiji came after the Saudi-based Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the largest bloc of Muslim countries, issued a similar statement following a high-level meeting the day before.\n\nIran has vowed to avenge the July 31 explosion that killed Ismail Haniyeh, which was widely blamed on Israel, raising fears of a regional war. Israel has not said whether it was involved.\n\nElKhereiji said the killing of Haniyeh was a \"flagrant violation of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national security of the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as international law and the Charter of the United Nations, and constitutes a threat to regional peace and security.\"\n\nThe statement did not directly blame Israel but

Gaza is experiencing a severe humanitarian crisis due to ongoing conflict and aid restrictions.

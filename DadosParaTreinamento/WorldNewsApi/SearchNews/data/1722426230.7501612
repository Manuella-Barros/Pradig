The blaze, which started on Thursday afternoon due to human activity, is burning near Scottsdale in the Boulder Heights subdivision, causing about 60 residents to evacuate and threatening areas around the Tonto National Forest. Authorities reported no injuries or structural damage.The 'Boulder View Fire', has consumed approximately 5 square miles with no containment. Gusty winds and extremely hot, dry conditions continue to fuel the flames. The wildfire produced 20-40 foot flame lengths in several areas.\u201cThe southeast side of the fire remained active throughout the night producing 20-40 foot flame lengths in areas. Additional resources were redirected to that side of the fire last night to begin structure protection and help crews start firing operations to tie the fire into nearby roads,\u201d said Tiffany Davila, spokesperson for the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management, as quoted by AP.Evacuation efforts have been coordinated with the Red Cross setting up a center at a high school in Scottsdale. Shelters for horses and other large animals have been arranged at locations such as the rodeo grounds at Cave Creek. Scottsdale officials have closed part of the McDowell Sonoran Preserve as a precaution, though they noted there was no immediate threat.Air tankers equipped with red retardant and helicopters with giant buckets of water have supported ground crews in their efforts to keep the flames away from power lines. The National Weather Service forecasts above-normal temperatures to persist into next week, with many desert locations expected to see highs around or above 110 degrees Fahrenheit each afternoon.Meanwhile, conditions have improved south of Bend, Oregon, where the threat from a wildfire near La Pine has decreased, allowing officials to release some of the firefighting crews. The Darlene 3 fire near La Pine has burned around 6 square miles and is now 42% contained. Firefighters have established fire lines around nearly half of the fire's perimeter.In Central California, about 200 firefighters continue to make progress on a substantial blaze that has scorched an estimated 9 square miles about 60 miles east of Fresno. This fire is the only one still burning out of 18 fires that were ignited by lightning storms across the western edge of the Sierra Nevada earlier this week.", "summary": "<img border=\"0\" hspace=\"10\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin-top:3px;margin-right:5px;\" src=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/111355080.cms\" />", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/arizona-wildfire-firefighters-battle-to-control-blaze-tankers-helicopters-come-to-aid/articleshow/111355080.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-111355957/111355957.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:51:14", "author": "Toi World Desk", "authors": ["Toi World Desk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.046}

She\u2019s joined by a friend, played by Richard Roundtree in his final role.

Aug. 9: \u2018Borderlands\u2019 Kevin Hart, Cate Blanchett, Jack Black and Jamie Lee Curtis lead a star-studded cast in this film adaptation of the popular video game series. Movie versions of video games don\u2019t traditionally go well, but the trailer for this one looks funny. Aug 16: \u2018The Union\u2019 - Netflix Halle Berry and Mark Wahlberg are spies who find themselves back in the espionage game as they\u2019re drawn into an adventure through Europe. Let\u2019s be honest: This is probably exactly what we think it is. Aug. 23: \u2018The Crow\u2019 After a winding road through development hell, Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd stars as Eric Draven, the rock star turned undead vigilante, with FKA twigs as his true love, Shelly.

Aug. 23: \u2018Blink Twice\u2019 Zo\u00eb Kravitz makes her directorial debut with this thriller starring Naomi Ackie as a cocktail waitress who heads to a tech billionaire\u2019s (Channing Tatum) private island, where things go terribly wrong.", "summary": "<img class=\"type:primaryImage\" src=\"https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_80,w_636/935755f067fefabce7f916391dee35aa.jpg\"/><p>As we roll into Memorial Day weekend, t it\u2019s time to get excited about all the blockbusters set to hit movie theaters in the summer.

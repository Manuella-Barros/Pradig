But viewers stood firmly on Costco\u2019s side\u2014with many ripping into the woman for making a big fuss. TikToker Mama Butter (@mamabutteronaroll) uploaded a video earlier this week in which she shared a \u201cwild\u201d story about her recent Costco purchase. Indeed, she was not happy. \u201cWe just cut into our\u2026 graduation cake from Costco,\u201d Mama Butter said. \u201cLemme show y\u2019all this.\u201d She then proceeded to show viewers the sheet cake, which was covered in a thin layer of vanilla-looking frosting. \u201cI have never been so disappointed in Costco in my life,\u201d Mama Butter said. \u201cHow is this even real?\u201d As of Sunday, her video had amassed more than 3.5 million views. What was wrong with the cake? At first glance, many viewers said that they couldn\u2019t spot anything wrong with the dessert. \u201cLooks like a regular, normal cake to me,\u201d one commenter wrote. \u201cMe trying to figure out what was wrong and wishing I had a piece,\u201d another added. To this, Mama Butter responded that the cake was meant to have a cheesecake filling. \u201cThe\u2026 filling is missing,\u201d she said. In another comment, she said the cake cost $24.99. In the video, Mama Butter proceeded to question how Costco could dare mess up her order. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cAbsolutely nothing. I can\u2019t even believe it. How does that even happen, Costco? What did you do to my cake?\u201d Toward the end of her video, Mama Butter reaffirmed her disappointment. \u201cMy heart has been broken tonight,\u201d she said. @mamabutteronaroll Is this even real? Am I dreaming?! What happened to the filling @Costco Wholesale #fyp #indiana #foryourpage #costco #costcocake \u266c original sound \u2013 Mama Butter How are viewers responding? Some Costco customers said they\u2019d be elated had they received a filling-less cake. \u201cFinally cake without filling,\u201d one person said. \u201cNow I want Costco cake,\u201d another wrote. \u201cI\u2019d be so excited if my Costco came like that,\u201d a third commenter added. \u201cI hate the custard.\u201d But even after realizing what was supposedly wrong with the cake, some viewers still couldn\u2019t understand why a simple mistake stirred such outrage. That led a number of people to joke that Mama Butter was being dramatic. \u201cHave you called the authorities?\u201d one person asked. \u201cSending thoughts and prayers that Lord Jesus Christ gets you through this horrible tragedy,\u201d another quipped. \u201cStay strong!\u201d \u201cGood news is\u2026 I think you\u2019ll live,\u201d a third person wrote. Mama Butter, at least, appeared aware that she was being somewhat theatrical in her response. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s ok to be silly and dramatic,\u201d she responded to one commenter. \u201cJust can\u2019t live in it.\u201d The Daily Dot has reached out to Mama Butter via TikTok comment and to Costco through its media request form.

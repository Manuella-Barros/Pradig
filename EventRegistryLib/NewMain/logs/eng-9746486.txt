Outside of football, Los Angeles Lakers basketball legend Kobe Bryant wore the number for much of his career, as did New York Yankees great Yogi Berra and Willie Stargell of the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nJackson's recent trademark applications include the phrases: \"Era 8 by Lamar Jackson,\" \"Era 8,\" \"You 8 yet?\" and others, making them bear a similarity to Aikman's \"EIGHT\"

In a U.S. Patent and Trademark Office complaint filed on July 9, Jackson's attorney wrote that Aikman using \"eight\" on apparel is \"likely to cause confusion, or cause mistake, or to deceive\" consumers about which quarterback is associated with the product.\n\nJackson filed the complaint against FL101, a company that lists Aikman as a director. FL101 owns nine variations of the \"Eight\" trademark for use in beer, energy drinks, and other products.\n\nJackson's attorney claimed Aikman's products are \"highly similar in sound, appearance, connotation, and commercial impression.\"\n\nThe complaint states that Jackson \"has expended considerable time, effort, and expense in promoting, advertising, and popularizing the number 8 in connection with his personality and fame.\" The two-time MVP owns or has applied for several trademarks related to the number, including \"Era 8\" and \"You 8 yet?\"\n\n\"Some of the instant reaction is, like, how can you own a number?\" Christine Farley, a law professor and intellectual property expert at American University, told Rothstein. \"The truth is you can own almost anything you think of as a trademark. You can own a smell. You can own a sound. You can own a single color. You can own a single number.\"\n\nIt'll certainly be interesting to see how Aikman discusses Jackson when calling Baltimore Ravens games.

According to ESPN, Jackson's attorneys have filed appeals in response to multiple trademark applications using the number 8. Of course, Jackson has worn the number his entire career, and owns several related trademarks himself.\n\nAikman's use of the number on merchandise would \"likely to cause confusion, or cause mistake, or to deceive\", Jackson's attorneys argue. They further state that Aikman's products are \"highly similar in sound, appearance, connotation, and commercial impression\".\n\nI haven't seen the merchandise for either party, so I don't know how similar they might look. What I do know is that the Ravens and the Cowboys don't share similar color patterns. I also know fans wanting to buy Lamar Jackson merchandise can probably distinguish him from Troy Aikman.\n\nYou can technically attempt to trademark virtually anything, and frequently succeed, in some cases rather absurdly. I imagine many would feel the same about this current matter, which is why people are writing articles about it. How, after all, can you own a number? Plenty of people wore the number 8 before Jackson did -- including Aikman.\n\nAnd Troy Aikman is a three-time Super Bowl winner and a Hall of Famer, so it's not like he is some random nobody. Lamar Jackson, to his credit, is a two-time NFL MVP and one of the most recognizable football players alive.\n\nAccording to ESPN, Aikman through his company has submitted nine trademark applications pertaining to use of the number 8. As mentioned, Jackson already owns numerous trademarks using the number in a variety of ways.\n\nBut what about Steve Young, who also wore the number? What about Ray Guy and Larry Wilson? All of them are in the Hall of Fame, with Aikman. Don't they have the right to sell products with their number? Shouldn't they have equal right to trademark \"8\" apparel as Jackson? Thene there's Kirk Cousins, another active player who wears the number. You like that? How about Archie Manning? He spawned a dynasty, and the Manning name is one of the most famous in the history of the sport.\n\nAnd lest we forget, Tommy Maddox also wore the number 8, including during his four seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Who doesn't want some Tommy Gun merchandise with a big, fat 8 on it? Apparently, not Lamar Jackson. At least he doesn't want you to be able to buy it, because you might be thinking you're buying one of his shirts.\n\nRelated Items:Lamar Jackson, Troy Aikman Recommended for you Spectator Sport: Ravens' Lamar Jackson 'Cheering Like The Fans' When He Hands Off To Derrick Henry 'Extremely Talented:' Rookie QB Devin Leary Impressing Ravens Coaches Lamar Jackson Wants His Receivers To Come To Him For Voluntary Workouts After Skipping OTAs", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_marczi@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Matthew Marczi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Aikman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Troy Aikman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lamar Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Maddox", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Maddox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wilson_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larry Wilson (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archie Manning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kirk Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Young", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Young"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lamar-Jackson-AFC-Champ-Loss-2023-Season-Ravens-Chiefs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746486", "eventUri": "eng-9746486", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

For this portion we will be taking a look at the man who brought multiple trophies home to Dallas, Troy Aikman.\n\nThis may be the easiest argument to make out of any of the Dallas signal callers, as Aikman is the winningest quarterback in the franchises' history and brought home a whopping three Super Bowl trophies. While Aikman never necessarily put up the big passing numbers, he always had Dallas in the game and was a big reason they were able to rely on their dominant running game.\n\nAikman played his best in the playoffs, lifting the team up when they needed it the most and composing multiple game winning drives for a dominant Cowboys team that won multiple championships. In his three Super Bowl winning playoff runs, Aikman managed to put up 17 touchdowns to just 4 interceptions, all while maintaining a quarterback rating of well over 100.0.\n\nThe argument for Aikman remains simple, but effective. A winner, a surgeon in the playoffs, and one of the most consistent players in franchise history. Is Aikman the best to ever do it for the Boys? You could certainly make that argument.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Aikman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Troy Aikman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passer rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2021-08/troy-aikman_hu3awtqab6x81h2adj6hdnz2v.jpg?itok=ueieJ6xT", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746486", "eventUri": "eng-9746486", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

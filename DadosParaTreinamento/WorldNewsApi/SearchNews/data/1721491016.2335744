Writer Amitav Ghosh wrote on X: \"The hounding of Arundhati Roy is absolutely unconscionable. She is a great writer and has the right to her opinion. There should be an international outcry against prosecuting her for something she said a decade ago.\" When Delhi authorities approved the case to proceed in court in October, Canadian writer and activist Naomi Klein warned Mr Modi on X: \"You have no idea what you will unleash by pursuing this political prosecution to silence your most eloquent critic.\" What exactly transpired on the day when Ms Roy made the comments? In the minutes of the conference, Shivam Vij described it as \"historic in every aspect given the topicality of the issue\". Speakers included a well-known poet, several activists and journalists. Ms Roy anticipated a heated debate. \"She began her speech by asking those who wanted to throw shoes to her to do so now,\" Mr Vij wrote. Shuddhabrata Sengupta, an artist, writer and curator who spoke at the event, wrote that the only \"provocative actions\" - interruptions, heckling, attempts to throw objects at stage - came from \"self-declared Indian patriots\". They were allowed to speak but were asked not to disrupt the proceedings, he noted. However, Mr Pandit, the Kashmiri activist present at the meeting, had a different view. \"Openly, in the heart of the capital, Delhi, a call for the destruction of the Indian Union as a colonial, occupying state, a state that has subjugated people... had no business to survive. Such statements were made. A call to arms rang out from the podium repeatedly... by Arundhati Roy [among others].\"", "summary": "Authorities have approved prosecuting writer Arundhati Roy under India\u2019s anti-terror laws.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3ggyz13m2po", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2ac2/live/524a8430-2c91-11ef-a867-038e8d92958c.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:08:52", "author": "Soutik Biswas", "authors": ["Soutik Biswas"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.328}

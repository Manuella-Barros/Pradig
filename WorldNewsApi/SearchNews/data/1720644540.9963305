We need some help on the parking lot. It\u2019s great you\u2019re \u2026 the head of the ER medical unit. We need somebody to hold this door. And that\u2019s the culture,\u201d Watley said. Kingdom Fellowship began as a satellite campus of the growing Reid Temple AME Church in nearby Montgomery County, which is where Watley served as executive pastor, overseeing the budget, local ministries and its 132,000 square-foot-facility featuring a sanctuary, credit union and bookstore that was completed in 2004. Watley also served as the de facto chief of staff for Reid Temple\u2019s senior pastor, the Rev. Lee Washington. \u201cHe had a lot of ideas,\u201d said Washington, who recently retired. \u201cI gave him the freedom and the flexibility to do what he thought was best.\u201d With Washington\u2019s blessing, those ideas included launching Reid Temple North with a small contingent of volunteers. They held the first worship service in 2006 in the Montgomery Blair High School cafeteria, where they met until 2010. The growing congregation moved into a renovated building in Silver Spring, Maryland, where Watley added a second Sunday service in 2011 and a third in 2013. The campus eventually became financially self-sufficient.", "summary": "CALVERTON, Md. (AP) &#8212; The Rev. Matthew L.

Before this, he addressed the workers at the party office. During this, he explained the whole game of EVM to his workers. He (Arvind Kejriwal) said that even if your candidate is losing, you should not leave from there but you should stay till the end. Kejriwal (Arvind Kejriwal) said that what was the hurry in getting fake exit polls done before the counting? This needs to be understood. I also did not understand. Many things are going on in the minds of many people. One theory is that they have committed a scam with the machines. Kejriwal said that I have also told Sandeep Pathak and I also want to tell the leaders of India Alliance to tell their counting agents to be completely alert. Even if they are losing till the end, they should not get up and leave. Many times, after losing in one or two rounds, people get up and leave. Do not get up and leave. CM (Arvind Kejriwal) said that another theory is going around that their people have invested a lot of money in the stock market. They have to save it. Tomorrow when they make money, they should sell it and get out. Another theory is going around that BJP wants to put pressure on the officials so that they can get their wrong work done. He said that another theory is also going around that if the number of seats is less in the exit polls, then there will be a rebellion in the RSS against these two (PM Modi and Amit Shah). They do not even wait till the 4th. Therefore, we have to be alert. These people are playing mind games through exit polls.", "summary": "<p>New Delhi.

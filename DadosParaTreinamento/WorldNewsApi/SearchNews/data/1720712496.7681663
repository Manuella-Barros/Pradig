The former Philadelphia Eagles center, 36, shared how his family has adjusted to their newfound fame ever since the Kansas City Chiefs player began dating the 14-time Grammy winner in summer 2023. During a recent appearance on the Whiskey Ginger podcast, Jason admitted that he thought life had become \u201ccrazy\u201d for him and his wife, Kylie Kelce, but \u201cTravis and Taylor have taken it to another level.\u201d \u201cKylie and I think we have it bad and then we go hang out with one of them for a second,\u201d he told podcast host Andrew Santino on June 7. \u201cThis is a whole other situation here. You can\u2019t be a normal person at that point.\u201d The NFL star\u2019s comments come after a fan harassed Jason and Kylie in Margate City, New Jersey. The couple, who\u2019ve been married since 2018, were in the parking lot outside of Steve & Cookie\u2019s Restaurant and Oyster Bar on Memorial Day weekend when a woman banged on their truck asking for a photo. According to the viral Instagram video, Jason and Kelce declined her photo request and noted that it wasn\u2019t a good time. However, the woman reportedly became belligerent and yelled at Kylie, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t care who you are, you will never be allowed in this town.\u201d \u201cI can smell the alcohol on your breath,\u201d Kylie could be heard responding, as the camera panned away. \u201cYou\u2019re embarrassing yourself.\u201d The woman \u2013 who later identified herself as Andre\u00e9 Goldberg \u2013 issued a statement to local ABC News outlet WPVI, stating that she apologized directly to the Kelce family after the incident. \u201cIn a heated moment, I said things that were out of character for me and that I regret and for that, I am sorry,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cAlthough I apologized directly to the Kelce family on Saturday, I want to publicly apologize to them, and our community. My anger, and my actions, are not who I am, and certainly not indicative of the welcoming community of Margate.\u201d Margate City Mayor Michael Collin also released a statement on Facebook expressing his embarrassment and regret. \u201cOn behalf of the City of Margate, I\u2019d like to formally apologize to Jason & Kylie Kelce for the experience they had in Margate City over the holiday weekend,\u201d he wrote on the city\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cAs a father with young children, I know as well as anyone the importance of a date night with your wife and would like to offer a redo date night with dinner on me.\u201d Seemingly reflecting on the incident, Jason explained during the podcast that Kylie is \u201ca little bit uncomfortable\u201d with the levels of fame they\u2019re receiving, but they have \u201ctried to retract\u201d from the attention. \u201cShe enjoys the fact that she gets to go and do charitable outings, she gets to give back to the community, she gets to do clinics with little girls with field hockey and all these other things,\u201d the father of three told Santino. While Kylie may be \u201ca little more hesitant\u201d to embrace their newfound fame, Jason said that he reminds his wife that they\u2019re going to \u201cget through it\u201d together. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to always be available, but I think more often than not it\u2019s such an awesome interaction, whenever you\u2019re doing that stuff and the vast majority of people are\u2026 respectful and appreciative,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re in a position of great fortune to be able to be where we\u2019re at and it\u2019s all because of these people that are really, really big fans.\u201d Jason and Kylie have been married for six years. The couple went public with their relationship in 2015, after meeting on Tinder. Following their wedding in 2018, the pair went on to welcome their first daughter, Wyatt Elizabeth, in October 2019; their second daughter, Elliotte Ray, in March 2021; and their third daughter, Bennett Llewellyn, in February 2023.", "summary": "<p>Jason Kelce shares how his family has adjusted to their newfound fame amid his brother Travis Kelce\u2019s relationship with Taylor Swift</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/jason-kelce-travis-normal-person-fame-b2559457.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/09/15/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/nE5FZTJY-OhrQWqOm.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:02:12", "author": "Meredith Clark", "authors": ["Meredith Clark"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.169}

The Quebec government, meanwhile, claims patients will still be able to receive treatment in the language of their choice.\n\nAnna Gainey, federal MP for Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Westmount, says her constituents are concerned the directive could disrupt the way they communicate with health-care providers. In a statement posted to the X platform Wednesday evening, Gainey said she's spoken with federal Health Minister Mark Holland.\n\n\"It is clear that the confusion and uncertainty created by the directive is likely to have adverse consequences that cannot be ignored,\" she wrote. \"Clarity is urgently needed. The choice of language should continue to belong to the patient.\"\n\nGainey said Ottawa should be ready to insist that Quebec respect the fundamental principles of the Canada Health Act, which include accessibility of care.\n\nIn a post on X Thursday morning, Mount Royal MP Anthony Housefather said he shares Gainey's views. \"When it comes to health care the language preferred by the patient is paramount,\" he wrote. Both Gainey and Housefather represent majority-anglophone ridings on the Island of Montreal.\n\nThe 23-page directive comes in response to Bill 96, the contentious 2022 law designed to protect the French language in Quebec. The bill requires that government agencies, including health services, communicate with the public in French, except in certain situations.\n\nAt the time, Premier Francois Legault insisted access to health care would not be affected by the new law. But in an interview Thursday, Housefather said the new directive tells a different story. \"If everybody was just entitled to receive services in English, there's no need for this directive,\" he said. \"So clearly some category of people only is allowed to receive service in English under exceptional situations.\"\n\nAccording to the document, a language other than French can only be used in health-care settings when \"health, public safety or the principles of natural justice require it,\" including in emergencies.\n\nIt includes a number of examples of situations in which English or another language may be used. In one, a 14-year-old girl is seeking an abortion and is accompanied by someone who doesn't speak French. In that case, instructions for follow-up care can be given to the support person in their language.\n\nIn another example, a 10-year-old boy requires emergency medical care. In that case, health-care professionals are allowed to ask for his anglophone father's consent in English.\n\nThe directive also stipulates that members of Quebec's historic anglophone community must provide a certificate proving their eligibility to attend English school in the province if they want to receive all medical services exclusively in English. Housefather said he's skeptical that provision would ever be put into practice.\n\nFurthermore, immigrants to the province are only eligible to receive health care in a language other than French for the first six months after their arrival.\n\nJean-Francois Roberge, Quebec's minister of the French language, insists his government is not imposing barriers for people who want to receive health care in English. In a post on X last week, he said the directive only requires that administrative communications be in French, not all forms of care. \"It allows all people who wish to receive health care in a language other than French,\" he said.\n\nBut Montreal lawyer Eric Maldoff said the directive includes no obligation to provide health services in English for patients who request it. \"This would be very simply resolved if they get back to the idea that it's the patient or the user of the services that should control the language of communication,\" he said.\n\nHousefather said there's a legal argument to be made that the directive violates the principle of accessibility under the Canada Health Act. \"I believe that the notion that English services are readily available in a location but you're legally forbidden from giving them to somebody who prefers to have their service in English is a problem,\" he said.\n\n\"And I would want to see, if Quebec insisted on taking that fairly absurd position, the federal government saying that, 'We don't agree.\"'", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Quebec government, meanwhile, claims patients will still be able to receive treatment in the language of their choice.\n\nAnna Gainey, federal MP for Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ce -- Westmount, says her constituents are concerned the directive could disrupt the way they communicate with health-care providers. In a statement posted to the X platform Wednesday evening, Gainey said she's spoken with federal Health Minister Mark Holland.\n\n\"It is clear that the confusion and uncertainty created by the directive is likely to have adverse consequences that cannot be ignored,\" she wrote. \"Clarity is urgently needed. The choice of language should continue to belong to the patient.\"\n\nGainey said Ottawa should be ready to insist that Quebec respect the fundamental principles of the Canada Health Act, which include accessibility of care.\n\nIn a post on X Thursday morning, Mount Royal MP Anthony Housefather said he shares Gainey's views. \"When it comes to health care the language preferred by the patient is paramount,\" he wrote. Both Gainey and Housefather represent majority-anglophone ridings on the Island of Montreal.\n\nThe 23-page directive comes in response to Bill 96, the contentious 2022 law designed to protect the French language in Quebec. The bill requires that government agencies, including health services, communicate with the public in French, except in certain situations.\n\nAt the time, Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault insisted access to health care would not be affected by the new law. But in an interview Thursday, Housefather said the new directive tells a different story. \"If everybody was just entitled to receive services in English, there's no need for this directive,\" he said. \"So clearly some category of people only is allowed to receive service in English under exceptional situations.\"\n\nAccording to the document, a language other than French can only be used in health-care settings when \"health, public safety or the principles of natural justice require it,\" including in emergencies.\n\nIt includes a number of examples of situations in which English or another language may be used. In one, a 14-year-old girl is seeking an abortion and is accompanied by someone who doesn't speak French. In that case, instructions for followup care can be given to the support person in their language.\n\nIn another example, a 10-year-old boy requires emergency medical care. In that case, health-care professionals are allowed to ask for his anglophone father's consent in English.\n\nThe directive also stipulates that members of Quebec's historic anglophone community must provide a certificate proving their eligibility to attend English school in the province if they want to receive all medical services exclusively in English. Housefather said he's skeptical that provision would ever be put into practice.\n\nFurthermore, immigrants to the province are only eligible to receive health care in a language other than French for the first six months after their arrival.\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Roberge, Quebec's minister of the French language, insists his government is not imposing barriers for people who want to receive health care in English. In a post on X last week, he said the directive only requires that administrative communications be in French, not all forms of care. \"It allows all people who wish to receive health care in a language other than French,\" he said.\n\nBut Montreal lawyer Eric Maldoff said the directive includes no obligation to provide health services in English for patients who request it. \"This would be very simply resolved if they get back to the idea that it's the patient or the user of the services that should control the language of communication,\" he said.\n\nHousefather said there's a legal argument to be made that the directive violates the principle of accessibility under the Canada Health Act. \"I believe that the notion that English services are readily available in a location but you're legally forbidden from giving them to somebody who prefers to have their service in English is a problem,\" he said.\n\n\"And I would want to see, if Quebec insisted on taking that fairly absurd position, the federal government saying that, 'We don't agree.'\"\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 8, 2024.\n\nMaura Forrest, The Canadian Press", "source": {"uri":

language in health care | RCI", "body": "MP Anna Gainey warns the directive could 'interfere' in communication between doctors and patients\n\nAt least three Quebec Liberal MPs have raised concerns with federal ministers about a new provincial directive they say limits access to health care in the province for patients who do not communicate in French.\n\nThe 31-page directive published by Quebec's health department last month says health care practitioners in the province may provide services in languages other than French only in exceptional circumstances -- if the patient can demonstrate that they cannot communicate in French or understand it properly, or if they can present paperwork showing they have a right to be served in English because of their historical anglophone roots.\n\nI'm all for protecting French, but this is going a little bit too far when it comes to health, Emmanuella Lambropoulos, the MP for the Montreal riding of St-Laurent, told CBC News.\n\nThe directive says anglophones who have an official certificate showing their eligibility to receive education services in English may receive health-care services in English.\n\nThe certificate is a document granted to anglophones who can prove their ancestors in Quebec had anglophone roots.\n\nFor patients who speak other languages and cannot communicate in French, the directive says a health care provider may disobey the obligation to use exclusively French as required.\n\nLambropoulos said that still gives far too much power to individual health care providers.\n\nI just don't think it's enough to say that the doctor is allowed to offer services in the language of their choice, she said, adding she has written to federal Health Minister Mark Holland about the issue.\n\nAnna Gainey, the MP for Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ce-Westmount, said in a statement published Wednesday night on X that she also spoke to Holland to \"share the serious concerns constituents have expressed regarding the Directive.\n\nThey are very worried because the Directive would interfere with effective communication between them and their caregivers.\n\nWATCH | Who can access Quebec health care in English?\n\nGainey said she's also spoken with caucus colleagues to ensure that the federal government, which is a major partner under the Canada Health Act, is aware of these concerns and prepared, if necessary, to step up and insist upon respect for its fundamental principles, in particular as it relates to universal access to care in both official languages.\n\nAnthony Housefather, the MP for Mount Royal, told CBC News he has reached out to both Holland and Employment Minister Randy Boissonnault, the federal minister responsible for official languages.\n\nSameer Zuberi, MP for Pierrefonds-Dollard, and Francis Scarpaleggia, MP for Lac St-Louis, said they're also concerned about the directive.\n\nIf we're starting to do linguistics exams at the same time as we do medical exams, this will not allow efficient delivery of health care, Zuberi said.\n\nWe have a sacrosanct principle that governments should not interfere, or anybody should not interfere, in the relationship between a doctor and a patient, Scarpaleggia said.\n\nEric Maldoff, a longtime advocate for anglophone rights and chair of the Coalition for Quality Health and Social Services, said it's encouraging to see federal MPs wade into the debate.\n\nIt's broadening this issue from just a bunch of whiny anglos always complaining, which is how the [provincial] government explains it away, ignoring it, he said.\n\nFeds can hold back money if Quebec is not providing services as it should he added, referring to how provincial health transfers are governed under the Canada Health Act.\n\nAt a news conference on Thursday, federal Transport Minister Pablo Rodriguez, who is also Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's lieutenant in Quebec, was asked if he thinks the federal government should intervene.",

(CBC)\n\nGainey said she's also spoken with caucus colleagues \"to ensure that the federal government, which is a major partner under the Canada Health Act, is aware of these concerns and prepared, if necessary, to step up and insist upon respect for its fundamental principles, in particular as it relates to universal access to care in both official languages.\"\n\nAnthony Housefather, the MP for Mount Royal, told CBC News he has reached out to both Holland and Employment Minister Randy Boissonnault, the federal minister responsible for official languages.\n\nSameer Zuberi, MP for Pierrefonds-Dollard, and Francis Scarpaleggia, MP for Lac St-Louis, said they're also concerned about the directive.\n\n\"If we're starting to do linguistics exams at the same time as we do medical exams, this will not allow efficient delivery of health care,\" Zuberi said.\n\n\"We have a sacrosanct principle that governments should not interfere, or anybody should not interfere, in the relationship between a doctor and a patient,\" Scarpaleggia said.\n\nMP interventions could make a difference: advocate\n\nEric Maldoff, a longtime advocate for anglophone rights and chair of the Coalition for Quality Health and Social Services, said it's encouraging to see federal MPs wade into the debate.\n\n\"It's broadening this issue from just a bunch of whiny anglos always complaining, which is how the [provincial] government explains it away, ignoring it,\" he said.\n\n\"Feds can hold back money if Quebec is not providing services as it should\" he added, referring to how provincial health transfers are governed under the Canada Health Act.\n\nAt a news conference on Thursday, federal Transport Minister Pablo Rodriguez, who is also Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's lieutenant in Quebec, was asked if he thinks the federal government should intervene.\n\nTransport Minister Pablo Rodriguez, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Quebec lieutenant, wouldn't comment on whether the federal government should intervene. (Spencer Colby/The Canadian Press)\n\n\"When you go to the doctor, it's really a stressful moment, it's an important moment. You don't know what you have. That is really a moment where it's very important for you to be understood by the person you're seeing,\" he said, deferring to Boissonnault and Holland for further comment.\n\nCBC News reached out to Boissonnault and Holland, as well as to Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, whose portfolio covers intergovernmental affairs. None of them returned the request for comment.\n\nCBC News also reached out to Quebec's French Language Minister Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Roberge, whose office said it would look into the query.", "source":

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jacques BoissinotMONTREAL - The Quebec government says it is ready to make changes to a controversial directive that has raised concerns the province is restricting access to health care in English. Three provincial ministers say in an open letter published this morning that the government is not limiting the availability of health services in English, and there will never be language requirements in Quebec to treat a patient. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Roberge, minister of the French language, Eric Girard, minister responsible for relations with English-speaking Quebecers, and Health Minister Christian Dub\u00e9 say they will meet with representatives of the English-speaking community to hear their concerns and reassure them. The letter comes as federal Liberal MPs have begun to raise concerns about the directive, which sets out specific examples of situations where English can be used in health-care settings. Federal Health Minister Mark Holland's office says in a statement this morning that the government expects provinces not to make decisions that would impede Canadians' access to health care in either official language. The 23-page Quebec directive says a language other than French can only be used in health-care settings when health, public safety or the principles of natural justice require it.

You don't know what you have. That is really a moment where it's very important for you to be understood by the person you're seeing,\" he said, deferring to Boissonnault and Holland for further comment.\n\nCBC News reached out to Boissonnault and Holland, as well as to Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, whose portfolio covers intergovernmental affairs. None of them returned the request for comment.\n\nCBC News also reached out to Quebec's French Language Minister Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Roberge, whose office said it would look into the query.", "source":

Organizations in the health and social services network do not request documentation or proof from users for the provision of care in a particular language.\n\nThe directive also recognizes the special status of health and social service establishments, such as the Jewish General and Santa Cabrini hospitals, which was also recognized by the Office qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de la langue fran\u00e7aise.\n\nThe government of Quebec's intention has never been to restrict access to health care for English speakers in Quebec. We understand that many people are concerned about the directive. We will be meeting with representatives of the English-speaking community to hear their concerns and reassure them of our desire to provide health care to Quebecers without linguistic requirements. We are open to clarifying the directive to make it clear that there will never be language requirements in Quebec to treat a patient.\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Roberge is the minister of the French language, and the minister responsible for Canadian relations and the Canadian Francophonie, for democratic institutions, for access to information and privacy, and for laicity.", "source": {"uri": "montrealgazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Montreal Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_the_French_Language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charter of the French Language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right to health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quebec"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Quebec"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_and_Social_Services_(Quebec)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Health and Social Services (Quebec)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francophonie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Francophonie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Fran\u00e7ois_Roberge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Roberge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-speaking_Quebecers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "English-speaking Quebecers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois_de_la_langue_fran\u00e7aise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Office qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de la langue fran\u00e7aise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Quebec", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Quebec"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linguistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Linguistics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Linguistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Communication_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Communication Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Language", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Language", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/montrealgazette/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/health-workers-training-20211201.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802867", "eventUri": "eng-9802867", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Asked about strikes that could disrupt the biggest event France has ever organized, she said, ''At this stage, we don't plan a strike during the Olympic Games. But if Emmanuel Macron continues to throw gasoline cans on the fires that he lighted ...''\n\nCGT has an open call for potential strikes by public service workers from July through September.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Confederation_of_Labour_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Confederation of Labour (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Binet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sophie Binet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_demonstration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political demonstration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels_and_Motels", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels and Motels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1721856413", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763607", "eventUri": "eng-9763607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

Staff at IOC's luxury Paris hotel go on strike", "body": "Workers say they have had no pay rise in seven yearsOlympic organisers have paid \u00a318.5m for use of hotel\n\nThe IOC was embarrassed on Thursday morning when workers from the luxury hotel occupied by its delegation at Paris 2024 went on strike, claiming they have not received a pay rise for seven years.\n\nA group of chefs, waiters and technical staff at the five-star Hotel du Collectionneur began a two-hour protest at 7am, causing some disruption to the breakfast service. It is understood to have bred consternation at the top of the International Olympic Committee, who will host regular dinners and events at the venue.\n\nOne such function is due to take place this evening and there is an awareness that further strike action over the next two and a half weeks could present an even more awkward scenario. The Olympic organisers are believed to have paid approximately \u00a318.5m for sole use of the premises during the Games.\n\nUnion Departmentale CGT Paris (UD CGT), a trade union representing the workers, posted a video from inside the hotel showing around a dozen staff lining one of the corridors used by guests. Some waved the union's flags and others held notices with slogans such as \"Luxury hotel, poverty wages\" and \"Give us back our social assets\".\n\nAccording to UD CGT, workers at Hotel du Collectionneur have not been given a pay rise for seven years. It claims that, despite a dividend of over \u00a38m being handed to shareholders this year, no breakthrough has been made in improving the financial position of its staff.\n\nThe Guardian understands that the offer of a 2% salary increase, made on Wednesday during the latest of five meetings in a negotiation with UD CGT that began in June, was rejected and led to the strike. Hotel du Collectionneur is thought to be an outlier among Paris's luxury hotels in not having reached agreements with its workers before the Olympics.\n\nCentral to the workers' demands is a \"13th month\", which is a common salary addition in France. It is essentially a bonus, or variable pay structure, in which an extra month's payment is received annually in December. While not mandatory, it is viewed as standard in the high-end hotel sector. The stance among Hotel Du Collectionneur's strikers is that the total of their demands represents only one twentieth of its contract with the IOC.\n\nOn Thursday the Guardian was turned away from Hotel Du Collectionneur, access to which is tightly limited, but IOC guests and dignitaries could be seen moving around the venue freely.

A day earlier, the S.F.A.-C.G.T. union announced a resolution ensuring that thousands of performers would participate in Friday's ceremony in exchange for increased broadcast royalties. More than 200 dancers had stopped a rehearsal on Monday to protest their compensation.\n\nThey joined rail workers, police officers, garbage collectors and others who have all threatened work stoppages in the long run-up to the 2024 Paris Olympics. In February, the Eiffel Tower closed for six days after employees walked off the job to demand better maintenance of the landmark as well as salary increases. For a weekend in May, air traffic controllers on strike led to the cancellation of 70% of flights at Paris' second biggest airport.\n\nIn a statement, The Gate Collection, which runs H\u00f4tel du Collectionneur, told The Guardian, \"Discussions are progressing in a climate of mutual respect and cooperation. Our hotel will continue to operate optimally during this period.\"\n\nAt 8%, France actually has a smaller percentage of union members than Germany, the UK or even the U.S (though almost all jobs are collectively bargained through unions). Instead of pure numbers, French workers have learned to rely on dramatic demonstrations for leverage. In the 2010s, the average French employee striked for 1.3 days, the EU's second highest tally during that period, according to the European Trade Union Institute.\n\n\"Unions and protestors turning to radical action here wind up competing with each other for the media coverage that creates -- since big press is what creates pressure on bosses and the government to concede,\" labor conflict expert Guy Groux told Time during another moment of disruption. \"The result is, there's constant obligation to up the ante to ensure protests don't wind up ignored.\"\n\nPolls also regularly show public support for the demonstrators. \"There is a general conviction that revolt is necessary,\" historian Jean Garrigues explained in 2019. That distrust of authority has also been used to explain France's relatively low union membership numbers.\n\nMore strikes are likely on their way.

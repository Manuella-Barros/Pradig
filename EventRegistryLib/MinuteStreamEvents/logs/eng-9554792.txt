(AP) -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says it found \"insufficient evidence\" that racial discrimination shaped decisions made by two Mississippi agencies about water system funding for the state's majority-Black capital city of Jackson.\n\nThe EPA's Office of External Civil Rights Compliance issued its findings this week about the investigation it started in October 2022 into the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality and the Mississippi State Department of Health.\n\nThe EPA announced its probe weeks after the national and state branches of the NAACP and nine Jackson residents filed a complaint alleging the state had a \"practice of systematically depriving Jackson the funds that it needs to operate and maintain its water facilities in a safe and reliable manner.\"\n\nJackson's water system nearly collapsed in late August 2022 after heavy rainfall and flooding exacerbated longstanding problems. Many people in the city of 150,000 lacked water for drinking, flushing or bathing for several weeks. A federally appointed administrator has been in charge of Jackson water since late 2022 and the federal government has approved $600 million for improvements to the city system.\n\nThe EPA wrote in its findings Monday that it investigated specific questions, including whether the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality's funding of water infrastructure and treatment programs is discriminatory.\n\nThe department's executive director, Chris Wells, said Wednesday that his agency was already following federal regulations.\n\n\"The evidence overwhelmingly shows that the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality did everything right,\" Wells said. \"These allegations were entirely false and have been a distraction to the mission of our agency.\"\n\nThe Health Department said in a statement that it is \"committed to the equal opportunity for all counties, municipalities, districts and other water organizations\" to have access to a loan program for water system improvements.\n\nThe Associated Press on Thursday sent email to the national NAACP about the EPA's findings and a spokesperson for the civil rights organization did not immediately provide a comment.\n\nThe EPA examined state water fund loans to Mississippi communities between 1989 and 2021 and evaluated those based on the percentage of Black residents. Jackson's population was about 56% Black and 44% white in 1990, and the city's current population is about 82% Black and 15% white, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nThe EPA wrote that \"funding for Jackson did not decrease as the racial composition of Jackson changed during the period analyzed\" and the analysis found \"no statistically significant relationship between loan amount and race across the state over time.\"\n\nThe Department of Environmental Quality provided water loans to Jackson 13 times since 1990 -- every time the city applied.\n\n\"Although Jackson falls on the lower end of per capita funding ... there was no significant relationship between loan amounts per person and race over time,\" the EPA said.\n\nThe EPA also wrote that \"the impacts of the water crisis fell disproportionately on the majority Black community of Jackson,\" but \"there is insufficient evidence to establish a relationship between the amount of funding disbursed by MDEQ to Jackson over time and the racial composition of the community.\"\n\nJackson received three loans from a water improvement fund administered by the Health Department between 1997 and 2022, and the department told the EPA it never failed to approve completed applications from the capital city.\n\n\"For the years Jackson received loan awards, it received a large proportion of the total funding available for those years,\" the EPA wrote.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The incident came on top of other long-standing problems including leaks and breaks, broken monitoring equipment and lead contamination, which can damage children's brains and nervous systems.\n\nFollowing the flood incident, the NAACP lodged a civil rights complaint, alleging that the state discriminated against the people of Jackson, a majority Black city, by not giving it a fair share of federal water infrastructure funding.\n\nThe complaint said that the state was \"aware of Jackson's severe needs, but distributed to the city only a small fraction and disproportionately low amount\" of the federal funds it received.\n\n\"Despite Jackson's status as the most populous city in Mississippi, State agencies awarded federal funds from the Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund (DWSRF) just three times in the twenty-five years that this program has been in existence. Meanwhile, the State has funneled funds to majority-white areas in Mississippi despite their less acute needs,\" the NAACP said.\n\nThe closure of the probes without a discrimination finding follows a similar outcome to the EPA's investigation of state actions relating to chemical pollution in Louisiana. The EPA did not find discrimination by the state towards the predominantly Black residents of an industrial corridor known as \"Cancer Alley\" in a probe it closed last year.\n\nChris Wells, executive director of Mississippi's Department of Environmental Quality touted the outcome of the Jackson probes in a written statement.\n\n\"The evidence overwhelmingly shows that the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality did everything right,\" Wells said.\n\nThe state's health department shared a statement saying that it \"is committed to the equal opportunity for all counties, municipalities, districts and other water organizations to access the State's Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund.\"\n\nAsked for further comment on the probes' closure, an EPA spokesperson pointed to the $600 million the administration is devoting to address water issues in Jackson and said the agency will continue to work on its water issues.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_frazin@thehill.com", "name": "Rachel Frazin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Water scarcity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drinking water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NAACP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_poisoning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lead poisoning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Wells_(curler)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Wells (curler)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_Alley", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cancer Alley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_Department_of_Environmental_Quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_County,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wells County, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wells County, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Environmental_Chemistry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Environmental Chemistry", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Sanitary_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Sanitary Engineering", "wgt": 18}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/05a41dc7253447bcaa90856409f94696-e1686068307116.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554792", "eventUri": "eng-9554792", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

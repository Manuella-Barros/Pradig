The duo's strategic play and communication were key to their success.\n\nLaura Siegemund and Edouard Roger-Vasselin beat Desirae Krawczyk and Neal Skupski 6-4 7-5 to win their maiden mixed doubles title together at the French Open on Thursday.\n\nThe victory gave Germany's Siegemund a second mixed doubles Grand Slam crown while it was a first for Frenchman Roger-Vasselin which made it all the more special as it came on home soil. \"This was a last minute thing, I didn't want to play mixed (doubles) here because I was in the singles and doubles also,\" Siegemund said at the trophy presentation ceremony.\n\n\"Then Edouard texted me two hours before the deadline... I always wanted to play with him but it was somehow not working out. \"Then I was like, 'I can't say no'. Now he's finally free, he wants to play so I think it was a good decision!\"\n\nMeanwhile, it was a second straight loss in a Grand Slam final for Krawczyk and Skupski following their defeat at the Australian Open final in a match tiebreaker. Number two seeds Siegemund and Roger-Vasselin broke in the first game of the match and consolidated a 2-0 lead but Skupski and Krawczyk tried to fight back and had their moments with some key winners.\n\nYet the German-French duo held their serve and their teamwork, movement and communication helped them take the opening set when Siegemund smashed a cross-court winner at the net. Siegemund and Roger-Vasselin capitalised in the second set when they targeted Krawczyk's serve, as they broke to love in the third game to take a 2-1 lead.\n\nAt 4-2, they repeated the same tactic as Krawczyk struggled on serve, leaving Skupski in difficult situations at the net. But Krawczyk, a four-times Grand Slam mixed doubles winner, managed to hold before Skupski helped them break for the first time in the contest, letting out a load roar at the net after he smashed a winner.\n\nOn the deciding point at 4-4 on Skupski's serve, Krawczyk missed an easy shot at the net which went wide to hand Siegemund and Roger-Vasselin the crucial break, but the British-American pair saved a championship point off the Frenchman's serve. But for a third time in the set, they targeted Krawczyk's serve and broke as Siegemund got the better of Skupski twice at the net.\n\nThe German then held serve as they clinched a first Grand Slam title together when Skupsi found the net on championship point.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@devdiscourse.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desirae_Krawczyk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Desirae Krawczyk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c9douard_Roger-Vasselin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "\u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Skupski", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neal Skupski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Siegemund", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laura Siegemund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Multi-Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Multi-Events", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/06_06_2024_12_32_35_5487838.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629491", "eventUri": "eng-9629491", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 228, "relevance": 1}

But Krawczyk, a four-times Grand Slam mixed doubles winner, managed to hold before Skupski helped them break for the first time in the contest, letting out a load roar at the net after he smashed a winner.\n\nOn the deciding point at 4-4 on Skupski's serve, Krawczyk missed an easy shot at the net which went wide to hand Siegemund and Roger-Vasselin the crucial break, but the British-American pair saved a championship point off the Frenchman's serve.

After defeating the two-time Wimbledon champions to lift the trophy, Roger-Vasselin and Siegemund explained just how close they had come to not lining up for their team debut in the first place.\n\n\"This was a last-minute thing,\" explained Siegemund at the trophy ceremony on Court Philippe-Chatrier. \"I didn't want to play mixed here, because I was in singles and women's doubles also. Then Edouard texted me like two hours before the deadline.\n\n\"I always wanted to play with him, and it was always somehow not working out, and then I was like, 'I can't say no, now he's finally free'. So I think it was a good decision that we signed up. Thank you so much for playing with me. I enjoyed some mixed before, but this was special, I really enjoyed it.\"\n\n\"Thank you Laura for accepting my last-minute [request],\" said home favourite Roger-Vasselin. \"Two hours before the deadline, I had no partner, and you said yes. I'm glad you said yes, and we had a great week, so thank you to you and your team as well.\"\n\nRoger-Vasselin and Siegemund broke Skupski's serve in the opening game of the match and stayed rock-solid from then on. The only major setback they faced came when they lost a deuce deciding point, which doubled as a championship point, on the Frenchman's serve at 4-5, 40/40. The second-seeded duo responded superbly to that disappointment, however, breaking Krawczyk's serve in the next game before holding firm behind Siegemund's delivery for victory.\n\nThe eventual champions were aggressive on return throughout their one-hour, 40-minute triumph. Roger-Vasselin and Siegemund converted four of 10 break points they earned, according to Infosys Stats, while they also fended off nine of the 11 break points they faced.\n\nIt was a second major title for Roger-Vasselin, the No. 11 in the PIF ATP Doubles Rankings, who won the Roland Garros men's doubles crown in 2014. Siegemund is now a three-time Grand Slam champion, having triumphed at the US Open in mixed doubles in 2016 and in women's doubles in 2020.", "source": {"uri": "atptour.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ATP Tour"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c9douard_Roger-Vasselin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "\u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Siegemund", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laura Siegemund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desirae_Krawczyk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Desirae Krawczyk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Skupski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neal Skupski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Double_Disc_Court", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Double Disc Court", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Gifts_in_a_Jar", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Gifts in a Jar", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Multi-Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Multi-Events", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Awards", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.atptour.com/-/media/images/news/2024/06/06/12/33/roger-vasselin-siegemund-roland-garros-2024-mixed-doubles-celebration.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629491", "eventUri": "eng-9629491", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

After defeating the two-time Wimbledon champions, Roger-Vasselin and Siegemund explained how close they had come to not lining up for their team debut in the first place.\n\n\"This was a last-minute thing,\" Siegemund said at the trophy ceremony on Court Philippe-Chatrier. \"I didn't want to play mixed here, because I was in singles and women's doubles also. Then Edouard texted me like two hours before the deadline.\n\nRoland Garros: Scores | Draws\n\n\"I always wanted to play with him, and it was always somehow not working out, and then I was like, 'I can't say no, now he's finally free.' So I think it was a good decision that we signed up. Thank you so much for playing with me. I enjoyed some mixed before, but this was special, I really enjoyed it.\"\n\nSaid Roger-Vasselin: \"Thank you Laura for accepting my last-minute [request.] Two hours before the deadline, I had no partner, and you said yes. I'm glad you said yes, and we had a great week, so thank you to you and your team as well.\"\n\nRoger-Vasselin and Siegemund broke Skupski's serve in the opening game of the match and stayed rock solid throughout the match. The only notable setback they faced came when they lost a deuce deciding point, which doubled as a championship point, on the Frenchman's serve at 4-5, 40/40. The second-seeded duo responded superbly, breaking Krawczyk's serve in the next game before holding firm behind Siegemund's delivery for victory.\n\nThe eventual champions were aggressive on return throughout their 1-hour, 40-minute win. Roger-Vasselin and Siegemund converted four of 10 break points they earned, while they also fended off nine of the 11 break points.\n\nIt was a second major title for Roger-Vasselin, who won the Roland Garros men's doubles crown in 2014.

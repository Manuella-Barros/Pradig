(AP) -- The California Supreme Court on Thursday sided with Gov. Gavin Newsom and removed a measure from the November ballot that would have made it harder to raise taxes, saying the change would have upended the way government works.\n\nThe measure would have required voters to approve any tax increase passed by the state Legislature. It also would have required all local tax increases to be approved by two-thirds of voters instead of a simple majority vote.\n\nThe biggest impact, however, was that the measure threatened to retroactively reverse most tax increases approved since Jan. 1, 2022. Local governments warned they would have lost billions of dollars in revenue that had previously been approved by voters. It would have also threatened a tax increase on guns and ammunition that lawmakers approved last year to pay for various gun safety programs and school safety improvements.\n\n\"The Supreme Court's decision to take this dangerous initiative off the ballot avoids a host of catastrophic impacts, protecting billions of dollars for schools, access to reproductive health care, gun safety laws that keep students safe in classrooms, and paid family leave,\" said Jonathan Underland, spokesperson for the campaign that opposed the initiative.\n\nSupporters of the measure called the ruling \"the greatest threat to democracy California has faced in recent memory,\" noting the measure followed the rules to qualify for the ballot by securing enough signatures from the public before the deadline.\n\n\"The governor has cynically terminated Californians' rights to engage in direct democracy despite his many claims that he is a defender of individual rights and democracy,\" the Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act campaign said in a news release.\n\nThe ballot initiative posed a tricky political question for Newsom, a Democrat now in his second term who is a potential candidate for president. He has opposed many tax increases, and campaigned against new taxes for the rich. But he has also been willing to temporarily increase business taxes to balance the state's budget, something he's proposing to do again this year.\n\nRepublicans on Thursday cast Newsom as \"greedy,\" arguing his successful attempt to block the measure will continue to make things more expensive in California, which has one of the highest tax burdens in the country according to the Tax Foundation and other groups.\n\n\"The California Democrat machine's love affair with new taxes to pay for their ludicrous policies keep costing Californians their hard-earned money, and Newsom just made it that much easier to take even more,\" said Jessica Millan Patterson, chairwoman of the California Republican Party.\n\nNewsom has argued he can oppose both new taxes and ballot measures he says would hamstring state and local governments from raising taxes in a time of crisis.\n\nRemoving a measure from the ballot before an election is rare, but not unprecedented in California. In 1999, the court removed one that would have cut lawmakers' salaries and removed their authority to set boundaries for legislative districts. The court removed that measure from the ballot because it included more than one subject.\n\nIn this case, the court ruled unanimously that the ballot measure was illegal because it would revise rather than amend the state Constitution. The court said while voters have the right to impose these new rules on raising taxes, they cannot do it via a ballot initiative because it \"would substantially alter our basic plan of government.\"\n\nRevising the Constitution would be more difficult, first requiring voters to approve the calling of a constitutional convention to consider the change.", "source": {"uri": "wboc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBOC TV-16"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wboc.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_question", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political question"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Direct democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_leave", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parental leave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Republican_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California Republican Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constituent_assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constituent assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Firms", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Firms", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Tax_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Tax Preparation", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/wboc.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/e0/ce058d61-00de-5fa0-a5fb-783c323163cf/667478140433e.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668658", "eventUri": "eng-9668658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Newsom and Democratic leaders in the Legislature on the constitutionality of a sweeping anti-tax measure, ruling Thursday that it cannot go before voters in November.\n\nThe business community-sponsored initiative, formally known as the Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act, broadly aims to make it more challenging to raise taxes in California, including by requiring the Legislature to seek approval from the voters for any new or higher state tax.\n\nNewsom and legislative leaders sued last fall to stop the measure, arguing that it amounts to an illegal attempt to revise the California Constitution and would impair essential government functions.\n\nIn a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court agreed, ordering Secretary of State Shirley Weber to refrain from taking any steps to place the initiative on the Nov. 5 ballot.\n\nThe proposed changes \"are within the electorate's prerogative to enact,\" Justice Goodwin Liu wrote, \"but because those changes would substantially alter our basic plan of government, the proposal cannot be enacted by initiative.\"\n\nProponents, led by the California Business Roundtable, introduced the initiative to crack down on what they contend are loopholes created by legislators and court rulings that weakened previous voter-approved tax accountability measures and allowed an unelected administrative bureaucracy to flourish. It has been heavily supported by the real estate industry and a private ambulance company, which frequently battle local governments over taxes, fees and assessments to fund public services.\n\nThe measure would also increase the margin to pass a voter-initiated special tax at the local level, to two-thirds from a simple majority; restrict how officials can calculate the cost of fees that fund public services and programs; and reclassify some of those charges as taxes.\n\nThese changes could upend the operation of California government at every level, prohibiting administrative agencies from setting levies and requiring the Legislature or local governments to turn to the voters to adjust them. Cities, counties and the unions that represent their employees have raised alarms that the initiative would blow a hole in their budgets, threatening their ability to provide essential services.\n\nOpponents argued in court during a hearing last month that, rather than simply amending tax law in the state constitution, this amounted to a fundamental restructuring of how government operates -- a more substantial change that can only be proposed by a two-thirds vote of the Legislature or through a constitutional convention. The initiative's proponents countered that the power of the legislative branch has always been shared with the public and urged the justices not to intervene in a political conflict that should be settled by voters.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers had already placed a competing measure on the November ballot designed to undermine the California Business Roundtable initiative.\n\nThe legislative measure flips the California Business Roundtable's own higher standards around, requiring any changes to the threshold for approving state and local taxes pass by that same margin. So if voters adopt it, the tax initiative would need to secure two-thirds support from the electorate to become law, rather than a simple majority, a high hurdle for a statewide ballot measure.", "source": {"uri": "laist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LAist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Weber", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shirley Weber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodwin_Liu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goodwin Liu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Roundtable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business Roundtable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_convention_(political_custom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional convention (political custom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_California", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_constitution_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State constitution (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Firms", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Firms", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Tax_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Tax Preparation", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/75fcd21/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x675+0+63/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi0.wp.com%2Fcalmatters.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F06%2F040324-CA-Supreme-Court-CASC-CM-01.jpg%3Fresize%3D1200%2C800%26ssl%3D1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668658", "eventUri": "eng-9668658", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 170, "textEnd": 176, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Newsom successfully petitioned to remove a proposition from the state's 2024 ballot that would have required all new taxes to be approved by voters, the Associated Press reported.\n\nNewsom and Democratic state lawmakers urged the California Supreme Court in September to remove the ballot measure, which would have required any new tax levied by the legislature to be approved by a popular vote and any local tax increase to be approved by two-thirds of voters, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The state Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the initiative must be removed from the ballot because it would revise, rather than amend, the state's constitution, according to the AP.\n\n\"Today's ruling is the greatest threat to democracy California has faced in recent memory,\" the Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act campaign said in a press release reacting to the ruling. \"The governor has cynically terminated Californians' rights to engage in direct democracy despite his many claims that he is a defender of individual rights and democracy.\"\n\nThe group claimed that 1.43 million voters signed the petition to qualify the measure to appear on the 2024 ballot, according to the press release.\n\nOpponents of the measure, however, stressed that the ability of the state to levy taxes is crucial to the provision of important services, the AP reported.\n\n\"The Supreme Court's decision to take this dangerous initiative off the ballot avoids a host of catastrophic impacts, protecting billions of dollars for schools, access to reproductive health care, gun safety laws that keep students safe in classrooms and paid family leave,\" Jonathan Underland, a spokesperson for the campaign against the initiative, said, according to the AP.\n\nIf passed, the measure would have retroactively repealed most of the tax increases passed by the state's Democratic leadership since 2022, including a tax hike on firearms and ammunition, the AP reported.

The budgetary pitfall is driven by declining state revenues.\n\nTens of thousands of Californians have left their state in recent years, with many of them taking significant resources with them.

Gavin Newsom, in a brief statement following the decision. \"The Governor believes the initiative process is a sacred part of our democracy, but as the Court's decision affirmed today, that process does not allow for an illegal constitutional revision.\"\n\nAssembly Speaker Robert Rivas (D-Hollister) said he was \"very pleased\" the court had \"rejected this unlawful and extreme effort to take power away from local communities to pay for essential services like police and firefighters.\"\n\nBusiness interests and taxpayer advocacy groups had championed the measure and collected the signatures needed to put it on the ballot, arguing its passage was vital for continued job creation and company retention in California.\n\nIn a joint statement, several major backers of the measure -- Rob Lapsley, president of the California Business Roundtable, Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association and Matthew Hargrove, president and CEO of the California Business Properties Association -- accused the high court of putting \"politics ahead of the Constitution.\"\n\nThey said Newsom had \"effectively erased the voice\" of more than a million voters who had signed the petition to put the measure on ballots.\n\nCalifornia Senate Republicans who had backed the measure denounced the decision as a partisan one from a liberal court.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Brian Jones (R-Santee) said he was \"disgusted\" with the ruling.\n\n\"The court has failed in its duty to the people of California and our democratic system and instead simply caved to pressure from the governor and legislative Democrats,\" he said.\n\nSen. Brian Dahle (R-Bieber) called the ruling a \"slap in the face to California citizens,\" as the court's \"partisan justices are not only interfering in the initiative process put in place to protect the people's right to be heard in our democracy, but they're doing it at the request of the very people who want to raise our taxes time and time again.\"\n\nBefore Thursday, Democratic lawmakers had been negotiating to have the measure voluntarily removed from the ballot as part of a broader policy deal. The timing of the decision does not give proponents enough time to amend the measure before the June 27 deadline to finalize initiatives for the ballot.\n\nOfficially known as the \"Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Initiative,\" the measure would have expanded the requirements necessary for a statewide tax increase from a two-thirds vote of the Legislature to a two-thirds vote by lawmakers and approval by a majority of California voters.\n\nIt would have also changed the threshold for passing local special taxes from a majority vote to a two-thirds vote of the people. Taxes, on things like income or the sale of goods, fund a variety of government expenses through the state's general fund.\n\nLocal governments would have been required to vote on any fee increases -- which can currently be approved administratively, and the measure called for a majority of the state Legislature to approve any state fee increases, which currently are often approved by state agencies and boards. Fees often are used to cover the cost of specific government services.\n\nBusiness groups argued the measure was necessary to add more checks on the taxing habits of progressive state leaders. Democratic state leaders and lawmakers, joined by unions and other liberal allies, had said the measure would undermine the Legislature's ability to balance the state's budget without threatening progressive policy priorities.\n\nLiu wrote that the court did not take a position on the \"wisdom\" of the \"fundamental changes\" included in the measure. Rather, it simply concluded that those changes constituted a \"revision\" of the state's constitution because they would \"fundamentally restructure the most basic of governmental powers\" -- and therefore could only be enacted through the established protocols for changing the constitution, not through a voter initiative.\n\n\"The TPA would exclude the levying of new taxes from the Legislature's control by requiring voter approval of all such measures. In so doing, it would disturb the long settled understanding,\" Liu wrote, that the \"power of taxation\" is an \"indispensable power\" of the Legislature, \"without which it would become impossible for that body to perform its functions.\"\n\nCiting the measure's additional restrictions on revenue gathering by both state and local governments, Liu wrote that the effects of the measure would be \"intensified\" -- because while \"a restriction on the ability of local governments to raise revenue might previously have been offset by the power of the state to raise revenue, the TPA burdens both simultaneously.\"\n\nLiu wrote the electorate \"remains free to modify\" the \"basic plan of our state government\" set forth in 1879 -- but only through the standard process for constitutional revisions.\n\nFormer Gov. Jerry Brown, who joined opponents in asking the court to remove the measure from the ballot, appointed Liu to the California Supreme Court in 2011.\n\nJonathan Underland, a spokesperson for a labor-backed campaign opposing the measure, praised the high court's decision.\n\n\"The Supreme Court's decision to take this dangerous initiative off the ballot avoids a host of catastrophic impacts, protecting billions of dollars for schools, access to reproductive healthcare, gun safety laws that keep students safe in classrooms, and paid family leave,\" he said.\n\nMembers of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) in California, a major labor organization that had worried about the impact of the measure on funding for teachers, police officers, fire fighters and other public sector employees, also praised the decision.\n\nDavid Huerta, the group's president, said in a statement that the measure \"was a flagrant attempt by a few extremely wealthy real estate developers to undermine our entire democratic system and our voice as voters and devastate the vital services Californians rely on -- all to avoid paying their fair share.\"", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com",

We cannot do this important work without your member support today. Whether you give for the first time or increase your monthly donation, it all goes a long way in setting us up for a sustainable future.\n\nThe California Supreme Court sided with Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democratic leaders in the Legislature on the constitutionality of a sweeping anti-tax measure, ruling Thursday that it cannot go before voters in November.\n\nThe business community-sponsored initiative, formally known as the Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act, broadly aims to make it more challenging to raise taxes in California, including by requiring the Legislature to seek approval from the voters for any new or higher state tax.\n\nNewsom and legislative leaders sued last fall to stop the measure, arguing that it amounts to an illegal attempt to revise the California Constitution and would impair essential government functions.\n\nIn a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court agreed, ordering Secretary of State Shirley Weber to refrain from taking any steps to place the initiative on the Nov. 5 ballot.\n\nThe proposed changes \"are within the electorate's prerogative to enact,\" Justice Goodwin Liu wrote, \"but because those changes would substantially alter our basic plan of government, the proposal cannot be enacted by initiative.\"\n\nProponents, led by the California Business Roundtable, introduced the initiative to crack down on what they contend are loopholes created by legislators and court rulings that weakened previous voter-approved tax accountability measures and allowed an unelected administrative bureaucracy to flourish. It has been heavily supported by the real estate industry and a private ambulance company, which frequently battle local governments over taxes, fees and assessments to fund public services.\n\nThe measure would also increase the margin to pass a voter-initiated special tax at the local level, to two-thirds from a simple majority; restrict how officials can calculate the cost of fees that fund public services and programs; and reclassify some of those charges as taxes.\n\nThese changes could upend the operation of California government at every level, prohibiting administrative agencies from setting levies and requiring the Legislature or local governments to turn to the voters to adjust them. Cities, counties and the unions that represent their employees have raised alarms that the initiative would blow a hole in their budgets, threatening their ability to provide essential services.\n\nOpponents argued in court during a hearing last month that, rather than simply amending tax law in the state constitution, this amounted to a fundamental restructuring of how government operates -- a more substantial change that can only be proposed by a two-thirds vote of the Legislature or through a constitutional convention. The initiative's proponents countered that the power of the legislative branch has always been shared with the public and urged the justices not to intervene in a political conflict that should be settled by voters.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers had already placed a competing measure on the November ballot designed to undermine the California Business Roundtable initiative.\n\nThe legislative measure flips the California Business Roundtable's own higher standards around, requiring any changes to the threshold for approving state and local taxes pass by that same margin. So if voters adopt it, the tax initiative would need to secure two-thirds support from the electorate to become law, rather than a simple majority, a high hurdle for a statewide ballot measure.", "source": {"uri": "laist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LAist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Weber", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shirley Weber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodwin_Liu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goodwin Liu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Roundtable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business Roundtable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bureaucracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_convention_(political_custom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional convention (political custom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_California", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_constitution_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State constitution (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Firms", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Firms", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Tax_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Tax Preparation", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8a454b0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+85/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi0.wp.com%2Fcalmatters.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F06%2F040324-CA-Supreme-Court-CASC-CM-01.jpg%3Fresize%3D1200%2C800%26ssl%3D1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668658", "eventUri": "eng-9668658", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 1190, "textEnd": 1196}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

It would have also threatened a tax increase on guns and ammunition that lawmakers approved last year to pay for various gun safety programs and school safety improvements.\n\n\"The Supreme Court's decision to take this dangerous initiative off the ballot avoids a host of catastrophic impacts, protecting billions of dollars for schools, access to reproductive health care, gun safety laws that keep students safe in classrooms, and paid family leave,\" said Jonathan Underland, spokesperson for the campaign that opposed the initiative.\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/california-supreme-court-nixes-ballot-measure-on-raising-taxes-sides-with-gov-newsom/", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_leave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parental leave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Tax_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Tax Preparation", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Household_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Household Employment", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 46}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668658", "eventUri": "eng-9668658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Newsom and Democratic leaders in the Legislature on the constitutionality of a sweeping anti-tax measure, ruling today that it cannot go before voters in November.\n\nThe business community-sponsored initiative, formally known as the Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act, broadly aims to make it more challenging to raise taxes in California, including by requiring the Legislature to seek approval from the voters for any new or higher state tax.\n\nNewsom and legislative leaders sued last fall to stop the measure, arguing that it amounts to an illegal attempt to revise the California Constitution and would impair essential government functions.\n\nIn a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court agreed, ordering Secretary of State Shirley Weber to refrain from taking any steps to place the initiative on the Nov. 5 ballot.\n\nThe proposed changes \"are within the electorate's prerogative to enact,\" Justice Goodwin Liu wrote, \"but because those changes would substantially alter our basic plan of government, the proposal cannot be enacted by initiative.\"\n\nThe extraordinary decision marks the first time in more than two decades that the court has struck an initiative from the ballot. It last happened in 1999, with a measure that sought to restrict state officers' pay and transfer redistricting power out of the Legislature.\n\nIn his opinion, Liu acknowledged the unusual nature of the preelection review, but wrote that waiting until after voters weighed in to consider the constitutionality of the initiative \"would be more challenging than in a typical case\" because it includes a retroactive provision that could invalidate existing taxes.\n\nIt \"would thus require the state and localities to start preparing to administer special elections if they wish to avoid nullification of taxes or charges,\" Liu wrote.\n\nProponents, led by the California Business Roundtable, introduced the initiative to crack down on what they contend are loopholes created by legislators and court rulings that weakened previous voter-approved tax accountability measures and allowed an unelected administrative bureaucracy to flourish. It has been heavily supported by the real estate industry and a private ambulance company, which frequently battle local governments over taxes, fees and assessments to fund public services.\n\nThe measure would also increase the margin to pass a voter-initiated special tax at the local level, to two-thirds from a simple majority; restrict how officials can calculate the cost of fees that fund public services and programs; and reclassify some of those charges as taxes.\n\nThese changes could upend the operation of California government at every level, prohibiting administrative agencies from setting levies and requiring the Legislature or local governments to turn to the voters to adjust them. Cities, counties and the unions that represent their employees have raised alarms that the initiative would blow a hole in their budgets, threatening their ability to provide essential services.\n\nThey celebrated the Supreme Court decision as a victory over corporate greed.\n\n\"The Taxpayer Deception Act was a flagrant attempt by a few extremely wealthy real estate developers to undermine our entire democratic system and our voice as voters and devastate the vital services Californians rely on - all to avoid paying their fair share,\" David Huerta, president of SEIU California and SEIU United Service Workers West, said in a statement. \"Today's ruling is a strong warning to corporate interests that even those with the fattest pocketbooks will be held accountable to follow our laws.\"\n\nOpponents argued in court during a hearing last month that, rather than simply amending tax law in the state constitution, this amounted to a fundamental restructuring of how government operates -- a more substantial change that can only be proposed by a two-thirds vote of the Legislature or through a constitutional convention. The initiative's proponents countered that the power of the legislative branch has always been shared with the public and urged the justices not to intervene in a political conflict that should be settled by voters.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers must now decide by June 27 whether to continue with a competing measure that they placed on the November ballot last year to undermine the California Business Roundtable initiative.\n\nThe legislative measure flips the California Business Roundtable's own higher standards around, requiring any changes to the threshold for approving state and local taxes pass by that same margin. That would have meant the anti-tax initiative needed to secure two-thirds support from the electorate to become law, rather than a simple majority, a high hurdle for a statewide ballot measure.\n\nA representative for Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, did not immediately respond to a question about the Legislature's plans, but in a statement, the Salinas Democrat said he was \"very pleased the California Supreme Court rejected this unlawful and extreme effort to take power away from local communities to pay for essential services like police and firefighters.\"\n\nRepublicans slammed the ruling as partisan politics that silenced more than a million voters who signed the petition to place the initiative on the ballot.\n\n\"I'm disgusted,\" Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones, a San Diego Republican, said in a statement. \"The court has failed in its duty to the people of California and our democratic system and instead simply caved to pressure from the governor and legislative Democrats.\"", "source": {"uri": "chicoer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chico Enterprise-Record"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodwin_Liu", "type":

Gavin Newsom successfully petitioned to remove a proposition from the state's 2024 ballot that would have required all new taxes to be approved by voters, the Associated Press reported.\n\nNewsom and Democratic state lawmakers urged the California Supreme Court in September to remove the ballot measure, which would have required any new tax levied by the legislature to be approved by a popular vote and any local tax increase to be approved by two-thirds of voters, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The state Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the initiative must be removed from the ballot because it would revise, rather than amend, the state's constitution, according to the AP.\n\n\"Today's ruling is the greatest threat to democracy California has faced in recent memory,\" the Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act campaign said in a press release reacting to the ruling. \"The governor has cynically terminated Californians' rights to engage in direct democracy despite his many claims that he is a defender of individual rights and democracy.\"\n\nThe group claimed that 1.43 million voters signed the petition to qualify the measure to appear on the 2024 ballot, according to the press release. (RELATED: It Could Take California Until 2030 To Fully Recover From Its Population Exodus)\n\nOpponents of the measure, however, stressed that the ability of the state to levy taxes is crucial to the provision of important services, the AP reported.\n\n\"The Supreme Court's decision to take this dangerous initiative off the ballot avoids a host of catastrophic impacts, protecting billions of dollars for schools, access to reproductive health care, gun safety laws that keep students safe in classrooms and paid family leave,\" Jonathan Underland, a spokesperson for the campaign against the initiative, said, according to the AP.\n\nIf passed, the measure would have retroactively repealed most of the tax increases passed by the state's Democratic leadership since 2022, including a tax hike on firearms and ammunition, the AP reported. Local officials warned that these repeals could have decreased public revenues by billions of dollars.\n\nThough Newsom opposed the ballot measure, he has also opposed some tax increases and advocated against new taxes on wealthy Californians, the AP reported. The governor has, however, proposed raising taxes on businesses to help balance the state's budget.\n\nCalifornia's Legislative Analyst's Office projects that the state's budget deficit will hit $73 billion during the 2024 fiscal year, which is $15 billion higher than its initial estimate. The budgetary pitfall is driven by declining state revenues.\n\nTens of thousands of Californians have left their state in recent years, with many of them taking significant resources with them. California saw a net loss of over 27,000 tax filers with an adjusted gross income of $200,000 or more between 2020 and 2021, according to the Tax Foundation.\n\n\"We are grateful the California Supreme Court unanimously removed this unconstitutional measure from the ballot. The Governor believes the initiative process is a sacred part of our democracy, but as the Court's decision affirmed today, that process does not allow for an illegal constitutional revision,\" a spokesperson for the California Governor's Office told the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Among other things, it would have required the legislature to obtain voter approval for any new or increased state taxes. There's nothing groundbreaking about it, as voters in other states have used the ballot box to approve or deny tax initiatives before. But Gavin Newsom and the Democrat-controlled legislature were having none of it and filed a lawsuit to block the measure last fall, claiming that the initiative represented an illegal effort to amend the California Constitution and would hinder critical government operations.\n\nJustice Goodwin Liu, who authored the decision for the unanimous court, wrote that the changes proposed by the measure \"would substantially alter our basic plan of government,\" and could only be enacted through a revision to the state's constitution.\n\nThe rare ruling by the state's highest court to remove an otherwise qualifying ballot measure comes just days before ballots must be finalized. It marks a major last-minute victory for Democratic leaders and labor unions, which had warned the measure would hamstring good governance in favor of corporations if passed.\n\nState leaders -- who brought the lawsuit challenging the measure -- had also argued the measure usurped their authority.\n\n\"We are grateful the California Supreme Court unanimously removed this unconstitutional measure from the ballot,\" Izzy Gardon, a spokesperson for Gov. Gavin Newsom, said in a brief statement. \"The Governor believes the initiative process is a sacred part of our democracy, but as the Court's decision affirmed today, that process does not allow for an illegal constitutional revision.\"\n\nRepublican Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones, however, was \"disgusted\" with the ruling, and accused the court of succumbing to political pressure.\n\n\"The court has failed in its duty to the people of California and our democratic system and instead simply caved to pressure from the governor and legislative Democrats,\" he said.\n\nSimilarly, Sen. Brian Dahle (R-Bieber) criticized the decision as a \"slap in the face\" to citizens and accused the court's partisan justices of interfering with the initiative process meant to safeguard the public's voice, while catering to those who repeatedly seek to increase taxes.\n\nIn a joint statement, several major backers of the measure -- Rob Lapsley, president of the California Business Roundtable, Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association and Matthew Hargrove, president and CEO of the California Business Properties Association -- accused the high court of putting \"politics ahead of the Constitution.\"\n\nThey said Newsom had \"effectively erased the voice\" of more than a million voters who had signed the petition to put the measure on ballots.\n\nCalifornia Senate Republicans who had backed the measure denounced the decision as a partisan one from a liberal court.\n\nThe California Supreme Court effectively silenced the voices of the voters. Can you appreciate how dangerous that is? We've already seen efforts by leftist groups to remove candidates from the ballot, including Donald Trump, for bogus reasons, Now, inconvenient ballot initiatives that would hold political leaders more accountable to the voters are being blocked by the courts in California.\n\nIf you live in California, you may want to move sooner rather than later.", "source": {"uri": "pjmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PJ Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_margolis@pjmedia.com", "name": "Matt Margolis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Dahle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian Dahle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodwin_Liu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goodwin Liu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_leader", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minority leader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Jarvis_Taxpayers_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California State Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Metrology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Metrology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/136/dd114b53-479f-4cc6-a301-0442dbc32c2b.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668658", "eventUri": "eng-9668658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

It last happened in 1999, with a measure that sought to restrict state officers' pay and transfer redistricting power out of the Legislature.\n\nProponents of the initiative called the ruling \"the greatest threat to democracy California has faced in recent memory\" and accused the court of putting \"politics ahead of the Constitution.\"\n\n\"Direct democracy and our initiative process are now at risk with this decision, showing California is firmly a one-party state where the governor and Legislature can politically influence courts to block ballot measures that threaten their ability to increase spending and raise taxes,\" Rob Lapsley, president of the California Business Roundtable, Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, and Matthew Hargrove, president and CEO of the California Business Properties Association said in a joint statement. \"This ruling sends a damning message to businesses in California and across the country that it is politically perilous to invest and grow jobs for the future.\"\n\nIn his opinion, Liu acknowledged the unusual nature of the preelection review, but wrote that waiting until after voters weighed in to consider the constitutionality of the initiative \"would be more challenging than in a typical case\" because it includes a retroactive provision that could invalidate existing taxes.\n\nIt \"would thus require the state and localities to start preparing to administer special elections if they wish to avoid nullification of taxes or charges,\" Liu wrote.\n\nProponents, led by the California Business Roundtable, introduced the initiative to crack down on what they contend are loopholes created by legislators and court rulings that weakened previous voter-approved tax accountability measures and allowed an unelected administrative bureaucracy to flourish. It has been heavily supported by the real estate industry and a private ambulance company, which frequently battle local governments over taxes, fees and assessments to fund public services.\n\nThe measure would also have increased the margin to pass a voter-initiated special tax at the local level, to two-thirds from a simple majority; restricted how officials can calculate the cost of fees that fund public services and programs; and reclassified some of those charges as taxes.\n\nThese changes could have upended the operation of California government at every level, prohibiting administrative agencies from setting levies and requiring the Legislature or local governments to turn to the voters to adjust them. Cities, counties and the unions that represent their employees have raised alarms that the initiative would blow a hole in their budgets, threatening their ability to provide essential services.\n\nThey celebrated the Supreme Court decision as a victory over corporate greed.\n\n\"The Taxpayer Deception Act was a flagrant attempt by a few extremely wealthy real estate developers to undermine our entire democratic system and our voice as voters and devastate the vital services Californians rely on -- all to avoid paying their fair share,\" David Huerta, president of SEIU California and SEIU United Service Workers West, said in a statement. \"Today's ruling is a strong warning to corporate interests that even those with the fattest pocketbooks will be held accountable to follow our laws.\"\n\nOpponents argued in court during a hearing last month that, rather than simply amending tax law in the state constitution, the initiative amounted to a fundamental restructuring of how government operates -- a more substantial change that can only be proposed by a two-thirds vote of the Legislature or through a constitutional convention. The initiative's proponents countered that the power of the legislative branch has always been shared with the public and urged the justices not to intervene in a political conflict that should be settled by voters.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers must now decide by June 27 whether to continue with a competing measure that they placed on the November ballot last year to undermine the California Business Roundtable initiative.\n\nThe legislative measure flips the California Business Roundtable's own higher standards around, requiring any changes to the threshold for approving state and local taxes pass by that same margin. That would have meant the anti-tax initiative needed to secure two-thirds support from the electorate to become law, rather than a simple majority, a high hurdle for a statewide ballot measure.\n\nA representative for Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, did not immediately respond to a question about the Legislature's plans, but in a statement, the Salinas Democrat said he was \"very pleased the California Supreme Court rejected this unlawful and extreme effort to take power away from local communities to pay for essential services like police and firefighters.\"\n\nRepublicans slammed the ruling as partisan politics that silenced more than a million voters who signed the petition to place the initiative on the ballot.\n\n\"I'm disgusted,\" Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones, a San Diego Republican, said in a statement. \"The court has failed in its duty to the people of California and our democratic system and instead simply caved to pressure from the governor and legislative Democrats.\"\n\nAlexei Koseff is a reporter with CalMatters.", "source": {"uri": "sanjoseinside.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Jose Inside"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Gavin Newsom and a Legislature controlled by fellow Democrats that the Taxpayer Protection Act, as it's called shorthand, would be a revision of the state constitution and cannot be proposed via initiative, rather than a constitutional amendment as its proponents contended.\n\n\"No speculation regarding potential future consequences is needed to conclude that the TPA is a revision on its face,\" the opinion declared. \"The measure would fundamentally restructure the most basic of governmental powers. The TPA would exclude the levying of new taxes from the Legislature's control by requiring voter approval of all such measures.\"\n\nThe ruling was a victory not only for Newsom and legislative leaders, but for the Democratic Party's most powerful political allies in public employee unions, which were prepared to spend tens of millions of dollars to defeat it.\n\n\"We applaud the Supreme Court's decision to remove the Taxpayer Deception Act from the ballot,\" Lorena Gonzalez, who heads the California Labor Federation, said in a statement. \"This unconstitutional measure was another cynical and self-serving effort by corporate interests to put their greed ahead of the needs of all Californians.\"\n\nIt was a crushing defeat for the California Business Roundtable and anti-tax groups such as the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, which had hoped that the measure, which would have required voter approval of new taxes, would block the tendency of Democratic officials in a deeply blue state to expand programs and raise taxes to pay for them when needed.\n\nRecent polling has indicated that Californians feel overtaxed, which would have helped the measure's backers potentially win in November. Fear of that outcome propelled Democratic officials to ask the Supreme Court to block the measure from reaching the ballot. They won the case exactly one week before the final deadline for determining what will make the ballot.\n\nThe tax initiative was just one example of how business and other conservative interests have turned to ballot measures -- both initiatives to make new laws and referendums to overturn legislative acts and counteract policies they consider to be onerous.\n\nJust days ago, for instance, Newsom and legislators agreed to make changes in California's unique Private Attorneys General Act rather than face a business-sponsored ballot measure that would have repealed the 21-year-old law allowing employees to pursue class-action lawsuits for violation of employment laws.\n\nLast year, a compromise was struck to water down a law that would have raised wages of fast-food workers and undermined the industry's franchise model. The Legislature is also trying to head off another pending measure that would toughen sentences for certain crimes.\n\nState law once mandated that when measures qualified for the ballot, they could not be removed. In 2014, however, legislation was passed to allow the removal of measures by their sponsors if their issues had been adequately addressed by the Legislature.\n\n\"By allowing an initiative proponent to withdraw their measure closer to the election, it allows for the possibility of reasoned compromise and a better result between the people's elected government and the people's initiative alternative,\" the lead sponsor of the legislation, then-Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, said at the time.\n\nIn practice, however, it empowered conservative interests to compel a liberal Legislature to pay attention to their demands by qualifying counteracting measures for the ballot.\n\nThursday's Supreme Court decision may give liberals a pathway, in some instances, to knock hostile measures off the ballot.", "source": {"uri": "calmatters.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "CalMatters"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_walters@calmatters.org", "name": "Dan Walters", "type": "author",

Liu, said the initiative constitutes a violation of Article XVIII of the state's Constitution by revising instead of amending the document and thus would require a Constitutional Convention or two-thirds vote from the Legislature before heading to voters.\n\n\"The measure exceeds the scope of the power to amend the Constitution via citizen initiative,\" the opinion reads. \"It is within the people's prerogative to make these changes, but they must be undertaken in a manner commensurate with their gravity.\"\n\nProvisions within the initiative would fundamentally affect every level of government in the state, the justices concluded.\n\n\"The [Taxpayer Protection Act] would shift so much authority, in such a significant manner, that it would substantially alter our framework of government,\" the opinion reads.\n\nOne point of contention justices found with the initiative is the requirement that any new tax -- with an expanded definition of such including any fees or costs to Californians -- would require voter approval.\n\n\"We have never before considered a voter approval requirement imposed on the Legislature like the one at issue here,\" the opinion reads, while also citing prior case law. \"We think it clear that a voter approval requirement for any new state tax measure would constitute a significant interference with the administration of [the Legislature's] fiscal powers and policies.\"\n\nJustices ruled that such changes fundamentally alter state and local governments' ability to raise revenues.\n\n\"We observe only that requiring any new or higher tax levy to undergo voter approval would significantly alter the existing constitutional balance between direct democracy and representative democracy, with reverberations throughout the framework of our government,\" the opinion reads.\n\n\"We conclude that the [initiative] would substantially transform the process for enacting new statewide tax legislation that has existed since the state's founding and that this transformation weighs significantly in favor of finding that the [initiative] would effect a constitutional revision.\"\n\nThe court found that the Legislature would be prevented from raising revenues quickly when necessary.\n\n\"This is particularly important when changes in revenue or appropriations are needed to respond to state or local emergencies,\" the opinion reads. \"By requiring the electorate to approve any new tax or any change in the use of any special tax revenue previously approved by the voters, the [Taxpayer Protection Act] would preclude the state from raising new revenue or redirecting any existing special tax revenue in light of unforeseen events, until after a statewide election.\"\n\nAs the state's Elections Code requires a minimum of 131 days between adoption of proposed ballot measures and a special election, the delay could hurt the state, according to the ruling.\n\nWhile the court generally reviews constitutional challenges to voter initiatives after elections, the justices said in this case a pre-election decision was proper because the measure did not follow the constitutional requirements and could take time and attention away from other ballot measures.\n\nThey also found that if the election took place and the court later overturned the electorate's decision, distrust in the process could proliferate and \"may contribute to an increasing cynicism on the part of the electorate with respect to the efficacy of the initiative process.\"\n\nRollback provisions included in the initiative -- which would void any state or local taxes adopted after January 1, 2022, if not subsequently approved by voters -- also concerned the justices because they would require governments to administer special elections and could jeopardize billions of dollars in taxes already approved.\n\n\"These provisions would effectively transform any postelection review of the [initiative] into another form of preelection review in advance of the special elections expected to take place the following year,\" the opinion reads. \"The rollback provisions also generate uncertainty before the election as to whether already enacted revenue measures will be later voided.\"\n\nThe ruling follows oral arguments presented on May 8. At the time, Margaret Prinzing -- the attorney representing the governor and Legislature -- told the court the measure should be tossed because it represents a revision to the state Constitution as opposed to an amendment.\n\n\"The initiative measure before this court is unlike any that has come before it,\" Ms. Prinzing said. \"This measure would fundamentally restructure the power of government to raise revenue as set forth in the California Constitution.\"\n\nShe argued that the Legislature has held the power to impose taxes since the state was founded but would lose that right if the measure was approved by voters.\n\n\"This measure would revoke that power for the first time in California and instead put it in the hands of the voters,\" Ms. Prinzing said. \"It's a revision that would occur in ways that would endanger the government's ability to provide essential government services.\"\n\nProponents argued that the Legislature's power is balanced by the will of the people.\n\n\"Voter approval has been a component of California's history since its inception and... the extension of that to other matters is perfectly within the realm of reason,\" Thomas Hiltachk, the attorney representing the measure and its supporters, told the court.\n\n\"What we have, essentially, is a two-way street where the legislative power is shared amongst these two groups: the people on the one hand and the Legislature on the other, but the people have the last word.\"\n\nHe said such rights are given to the electorate by the state's Constitution.\n\n\"Our constitution, since its inception, has stated that all political power is inherent in the people,\" Mr. Hiltachk said. \"It has stated that the people have the power to reform and alter their government whenever they decide it needs reform.\"\n\nSome lawmakers said they would prefer voters to have a say in the matter.\n\n\"I'm disgusted. The court has failed in its duty to the people of California and our democratic system,\" Senate Minority Leader Brian W. Jones said in a June 20 press release after the ruling was announced.\n\nWith the June 27 deadline looming, little time is left for legal action from proponents to have the measure placed on the ballot this year, though a similar initiative with revised language that seeks to address the court's concerns could be considered for an election in 2026 or 2028.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epoch Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional Convention (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/By-election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "By-election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Case law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Direct democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Representative democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Tax_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Tax Preparation", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2023/11/03/id5522832-State-Capital_JF_04192022-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668658", "eventUri": "eng-9668658", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 349, "textEnd": 356, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 758, "textEnd": 765, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-25", "textStart": 850, "textEnd": 857}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 5098, "textEnd": 5103}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

It would have also reclassified fees for public services and programs as taxes, requiring voter approval for things such as library fines.\n\n\"Such changes would substantially overhaul how local governments go about ensuring that everyday services are properly provided. In sum, the (proposal) would affect all local revenue measures -- big or small, essential or nonessential -- to an extent that leaves no aspect of government untouched,\" the court's opinion reads.\n\nThe measure had qualified for the ballot, prompting a lawsuit by Gov. Gavin Newsom and the state Legislature seeking to stop it from going to voters. It would have applied retroactively to January 2022 -- effectively canceling any special taxes approved in Santa Clara County in recent years.\n\nThat prompted a passionate rally among Santa Clara County activists, union leaders and Democratic elected officials in May, who called the measure a ploy by corporations to avoid paying their share for things such as development impact fees associated with construction projects, which can help communities fund infrastructure improvements. Others called it a logistical nightmare jeopardizing funding for essential services and canceling as many as eight recently passed ballot measures in Silicon Valley -- totaling $64.3 million in annual losses in jurisdictions such as Los Gatos and Palo Alto.\n\n\"Im very happy that the measure the court saw the measure for what it is and we won't have to put a lot of resources into protecting sources of revenue for cities and local governments this fall,\" San Jose Councilmember David Cohen, an outspoken opponent of the tax measure, told San Jos\u00e9 Spotlight.\n\nThe $17 million campaign for the measure has been spearheaded by the California Business Roundtable, composed of senior executives of major companies up and down the state, such as Apple, General Motors and Procter & Gamble. It's also being supported by the real estate industry, namely the California Business Properties Association. Proponents argue the initiative closes loopholes that empowered state lawmakers and unelected government administrators to raise fees for services.\n\n\"Today's ruling is the greatest threat to democracy California has faced in recent memory. Governor Newsom has effectively erased the voice of 1.43 million voters who signed the petition to qualify the Taxpayer Protection Act for the November ballot,\" Rob Lapsley, president of the California Business Roundtable, said in a statement. \"Most importantly, the governor has cynically terminated Californians' rights to engage in direct democracy despite his many claims that he is a defender of individual rights and democracy. Evidently, the governor wants to protect democracy and individual rights in other states, but not for all Californians.\"", "source": {"uri": "sanjosespotlight.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San

Gavin Newsom (D.) and Democratic legislative leaders who filed an emergency petition to block it. Initiative backers are decrying the state supreme court ruling as an \"absolute travesty\" and blow to California's tradition of voters deciding policy through the ballot.\n\nThe supreme court's seven justices, all but one of whom were appointed by Democratic governors, said the ballot measure would take too much taxation power from the Legislature and declared that the measure's backers would have to try to call a constitutional convention to push their proposal. The initiative proposed requiring a two-thirds voter majority approval of any new state and local special taxes, which Democratic legislators argued would make it too hard to raise revenue for emergencies.\n\n\"The measure would fundamentally restructure the most basic of governmental powers,\" the ruling stated. \"The [ballot measure] would exclude the levying of new taxes from the Legislature's control by requiring voter approval of all such measures.\"\n\nThe decision is a win for Newsom and Democratic leaders, even as they grapple with a $40 billion-plus deficit two years after spending a $100 billion surplus -- along with voter worries over the state's poor economic conditions. Along with their taxpayer-funded move to block the ballot initiative, Democratic lawmakers also voted to put on November's ballot an initiative to make it harder for Californians to reject proposed tax hikes. A top legislator said Democrats still plan on putting this latter measure before the voters even after this court win.\n\nBackers of the anti-tax proposal, who had gathered more than 1.4 million signatures to put it on November's ballot, blasted the ruling as anti-democratic and said they were already hearing concerns about the ruling's economic implications from business leaders and investors around the country.\n\n\"We're the highest-tax state in the country,\" said Rob Lapsley, co-chair of the committee behind the initiative, in a press conference following the ruling. \"Be scared.

They argued that the measure would change the state constitution, and therefore could not be accomplished via the initiative process.\n\nDuring oral arguments in May there was an extensive discussion about whether the initiative would basically create a fourth branch of government:\n\n\"From the founding of the state, the Legislature has had the supreme power of taxation,\" Margaret Prinzing, an attorney representing the state, told the court. \"This measure would revoke that power for the first time in the history of California and instead put it in the hands of the voters.\"\n\nPrinzing argued that, rather than simply amending tax law in the state constitution, this would fundamentally restructure how government operates -- a more substantial change that can only be proposed by a two-thirds vote of the Legislature or through a constitutional convention.\n\nJustice Goodwin Liu pressed the lawyer for the initiative's proponent, the California Business Roundtable, about that idea repeatedly during the hour-long hearing. He asked at one point whether giving voters authority over state taxes would create a fourth branch of government.\n\n\"Doesn't this measure essentially shift us from a republican form of government far more strongly towards a direct democracy, given how fundamental the taxing power is?\" Liu said.\n\nIn the opinion, Liu agreed with Prinzing's conclusion:\n\nAs relevant here, article XVIII of the California Constitution provides that the electorate \"may amend the Constitution by initiative\" (art. XVIII, \u00a7 3) but that an effort \"to revise the Constitution\" must proceed by way of a constitutional convention and popular ratification (id., \u00a7 2) or by submission to the voters from a supermajority of the Legislature (id., \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3). (See Amador Valley, supra, 22 Cal.3d at p. 221.) After reviewing the petition and the opposition filed by Proponent, we determined that Petitioners had made a prima facie showing that the TPA would amount to an invalid constitutional revision based on its far-reaching changes to existing processes by which revenue measures are enacted and maintained at the state and local levels.\n\nNewsom and Democrat leaders have thus far failed in their efforts to get an initiative to reform the state's horrific criminal-coddling Proposition 47, which he and George Gasc\u00f2n pimped back in 2014, off the ballot, but this week succeeded in coercing business leaders into an \"agreement\" to remove an initiative to reform the Private Attorney Generals Act from the ballot.\n\nAll while shouting about their love of \"Democracy.\"", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_van_laar@redstate.com", "name": "Jennifer Van Laar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_branch_of_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fourth branch of government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodwin_Liu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goodwin Liu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_constitution_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State constitution (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State legislature (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oral argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constituent_assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constituent assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Direct democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prima_facie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prima facie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ratification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Tax_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Tax Preparation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2020/290/f8572f82-ce4e-4e38-b3d2-e2231b53a7dd.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668658", "eventUri": "eng-9668658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Only the Legislature has authority to put a proposed revision before voters, and the TPA was initiated by business groups via a ballot measure.\n\nThe measure aimed to restrict tax increases across California by requiring voters to approve any new statewide tax and raising thresholds for approval of local taxes.

The measure sought to add an additional requirement that voters also sign off on tax hikes. It also would have reclassified many government fees as taxes and nullified recent tax increases that did not meet its new requirements.\n\n\"The TPA would exclude the levying of new taxes from the Legislature's control by requiring voter approval of all such measures\" the ruling, authored by Justice Goodwin H.

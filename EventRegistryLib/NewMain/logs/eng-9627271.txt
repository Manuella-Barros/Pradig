That is why the General Assembly adopted them,\" Trip Pollard, a senior attorney with the center, said in a statement.\n\n\"The Governor tried to get the legislature to repeal the law and failed; he cannot just dictate a different outcome,\" Pollard said.\n\nMiyares said in a statement that the opinion from his office confirms that Virginians are no longer required to follow California's standards.\n\n\"EV mandates like California's are unworkable and out of touch with reality, and thankfully the law does not bind us to their regulations,\" he said. \"California does not control which cars Virginians buy and any thoughts that automobile manufacturers should face millions of dollars in civil penalties rather than allowing our citizens to choose their own vehicles is completely absurd.\"\n\nIn a memo to the Department of Environmental Quality, the State Air Pollution Control Board and stakeholders, Natural and Historic Resources Secretary Travis A. Voyles said Wednesday that Virginia will default to federal standards at the end of the year. He said Miyares' opinion confirms that state law doesn't require the State Air Pollution Control Board to adopt California's new standards and the board has not acted under its discretionary authority to do so.\n\nVirginia's \"clean cars\" law was initially adopted in 2021, when the state government was under full Democratic control. It required that starting in 2024 a certain percentage of new passenger vehicles sold by manufacturers be electric or hybrid electric. Last year, Virginia Senate Democrats defeated several Republican efforts to repeal the law.\n\nThe mechanism for reaching the mandated vehicle sales threshold involved adopting California's vehicle emissions standards. California has had the authority to set its own rules for decades under a waiver from the federal Clean Air Act.\n\nThe program applies to manufacturers, not car dealers.

Glenn Youngkin announced Wednesday that Virginia will abandon California's stringent vehicle emissions rules aimed at reducing carbon pollution at the end of the year when that state's current regulations expire, citing an attorney general opinion.\n\nIn response to a request from Youngkin and Senate Republican Leader Ryan McDougle, Attorney General Jason Miyares' opinion issued Tuesday states that Virginia isn't required to comply with new mandates adopted by the California Air Resources Board set to take effect on Jan. 1.\n\nYoungkin, a Republican, said in a statement that Virginians deserve to choose which vehicles fit their needs and called the idea that government should tell people what kind of car they can buy \"fundamentally wrong.\"\n\n\"Once again, Virginia is declaring independence -- this time from a misguided electric vehicle mandate imposed by unelected leaders nearly 3,000 miles away from the Commonwealth,\" Youngkin said.\n\nThe move was quickly condemned by Democrats and environmental groups.\n\n\"He seems to think he has more power than Vladimir Putin,\" Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell said via text message. \"The governor is breaking the law and the AG is giving him cover.\"\n\nThe Southern Environmental Law Center called the decision \"illegal, shortsighted, and bad public policy.\"\n\n\"The Clean Cars standards will help spur the transition to cleaner vehicles and bring significant health and environmental benefits to all Virginians. That is why the General Assembly adopted them,\" Trip Pollard, a senior attorney with the center, said in a statement.\n\n\"The Governor tried to get the legislature to repeal the law and failed; he cannot just dictate a different outcome,\" Pollard said.\n\nMiyares said in a statement that the opinion from his office confirms that Virginians are no longer required to follow California's standards,\n\n\"EV mandates like California's are unworkable and out of touch with reality, and thankfully the law does not bind us to their regulations,\" he said. \"California does not control which cars Virginians buy and any thoughts that automobile manufacturers should face millions of dollars in civil penalties rather than allowing our citizens to choose their own vehicles is completely absurd.\"\n\nIn a memo to the Department of Environmental Quality, the State Air Pollution Control Board and stakeholders, Natural and Historic Resources Secretary Travis A. Voyles said Wednesday that Virginia will default to federal standards at the end of the year. He said Miyares' opinion confirms that state law doesn't require the State Air Pollution Control Board to adopt California's new standards and the board has not acted under its discretionary authority to do so.\n\nVirginia's \"clean cars\" law was initially adopted in 2021, when the state government was under full Democratic control. It required that starting in 2024 a certain percentage of new passenger vehicles sold by manufacturers be electric or hybrid electric. Last year, Virginia Senate Democrats defeated several Republican efforts to repeal the law.\n\nThe mechanism for reaching the mandated vehicle sales threshold involved adopting California's vehicle emissions standards. California has had the authority to set its own rules for decades under a waiver from the federal Clean Air Act.\n\nThe program applies to manufacturers, not car dealers. Manufacturers who aren't in compliance can buy credits from others who have surpassed the target.\n\n___\n\nBrumfield contributed to this report from Silver Spring, Maryland.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Attorney General Jason Miyares' opinion was issued Tuesday.\n\nDenise Lavoie And Sarah Brumfield, The Associated Press", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Glenn Youngkin said Wednesday that the state will no longer follow car emissions standards set by California, despite his party's failure to repeal or roll back a 2021 Democratic law that tied Virginia to those regulations.\n\nThe move tees up what could be another legal fight over Republican leaders' efforts to undo climate change-related measures Democrats passed when they had full control of state government a few years ago.\n\nThe governor has already drawn a lawsuit over his decision to end Virginia's participation in a regional program meant to curb carbon emissions from power plants, arguing the initiative was too burdensome for regular Virginians who had to absorb the cost through higher electricity bills.\n\nYoungkin has taken a similar line of attack against California's car emissions rules, which aim to slow climate change and reduce pollution by requiring the automotive industry to shift to selling more electric vehicles. The California standards require 100% of new cars sold to be electric vehicles starting in 2035, meaning the sale of new gas-powered vehicles would gradually be banned over the next decade.\n\n\"Once again, Virginia is declaring independence - this time from a misguided electric vehicle mandate imposed by unelected leaders nearly 3,000 miles away from the Commonwealth,\" Youngkin said in a news release Wednesday morning. \"The idea that government should tell people what kind of car they can or can't purchase is fundamentally wrong.\"\n\nThe governor said Virginia would stop following regulations set by the California Air Resources Board at the end of 2024.\n\nThe move drew swift condemnation from Democrats and environmental groups who said Youngkin and Attorney General Jason Miyares, whose office provided legal cover for Youngkin's action, were overstepping their authority to try to undo a law they didn't like.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said \"even Vladimir Putin does not claim to have this much power.\"\n\n\"Governor Youngkin and Attorney General Miyares' reckless, illegal and unconstitutional actions today are destructive of Virginia's pro-business reputation,\" Surovell said in a written statement. \"Working with a legislature that has a different political orientation can be challenging, but we fought a war in 1776 to ensure that an executive would never have the powers to nullify laws by press conference.\"\n\nVirginia House of Delegates Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, dinged Youngkin again for the governor's decision in late 2022 to scuttle talks about bringing a Ford electric vehicle battery plant to Southwest Virginia due to a Chinese company's involvement in the project.\n\n\"We know that electric vehicles are already taking off,\" Scott said Wednesday in a news release. \"The demand for them is just growing more each year. If Virginians can't find electric cars in their local dealerships, they will go out of state to buy their cars.\"\n\nYoungkin and Mirayes held a public event Wednesday afternoon at a Richmond-area Toyota dealership to explain the decision. The governor said it was not about bashing electric vehicles, but returning choices to consumers.\n\n\"I am very supportive of Virginians buying electric vehicles,\" Youngkin told reporters after the event. \"But I want Virginians to make that decision for themselves.\"\n\nAsked whether he agrees the planet would be better off with more people buying electric vehicles, Youngkin said he believes there's a \"real question\" on that front, given the complexities of making electric vehicle batteries and generating the energy to charge them.\n\n\"Let's just be clear, the power comes out of the wall,\" Youngkin said. \"And the wall has a power source that is a mix of generating capacity. And that is something that I think people forget to talk about.\"\n\nThe legal justification for Wednesday's announcement, laid out in a 9-page advisory opinion by Miyares, is that the first version of California's standards expire at the end of the year. Though they're being replaced with a new set of rules, Miyares opined that Virginia law doesn't strictly require Virginia's State Air Pollution Control Board to go along with the updated California standards.\n\n\"EV mandates like California's are unworkable and out of touch with reality, and thankfully the law does not bind us to their regulations,\" said Miyares, who's widely considered a possible GOP candidate for governor in 2025.\n\nThe Federal Clean Air act requires states to either follow California's admissions rules or regulations set by the federal government. Individual states don't have the power to make their own rules, partly to avoid forcing the auto industry to make vehicles tailored to a complicated patchwork of laws that could vary from state to state. The most populous state in the nation, California was granted unique permission to craft its own regulations to address local air pollution issues.\n\nYoungkin said the state will follow the less-strict federal emissions rules starting in 2025. Those rules still encourage the transition to electric vehicles, but on a less aggressive timeline than what California envisioned. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates new federal rules issued this year could be met if 56% of new vehicles sold are electric by 2032, according to the Associated Press. The Youngkin administration said electric vehicles made up 9% of new auto sales in Virginia last year.\n\nThe new legal interpretation by Miyares contradicts an earlier position by his office. In a 2022 email, an assistant attorney general wrote that Virginia was \"bound\" to the California standards. Severing Virginia from California's rules, the assistant attorney wrote, would require \"an amendment or repeal of the mandating legislation.\"\n\n\"It's been a while since I've seen that email,\" Miyares said Wednesday, emphasizing that the rules in California have changed and his office reached its new conclusion after an \"in-depth legal analysis.\"\n\nThe legal dispute could center on the difference between the words \"may\" and \"shall,\" a minor semantic distinction that nevertheless can have major legal implications for whether a law requires something or simply allows it. Virginia's 2021 law said the state's air board \"may\" adopt regulations tied to the California standards, but included several other \"shall\" clauses indicating what those regulations should include.\n\nEven though that might have been a \"scribbler's problem\" in the drafting of the bill, Miyares said, courts look at the \"plain language\" of what the law says to interpret what it means.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have introduced legislation aiming to do just that, but those bills have been blocked by Democrats who have controlled at least one General Assembly chamber ever since Youngkin took office. The legislative rollback efforts failed again this year now that Democrats control both the state Senate and the House of Delegates.\n\nIn a statement, the Southern Environmental Law Center called Youngkin's move \"illegal, shortsighted and bad public policy.\"\n\n\"The Clean Cars standards will help spur the transition to cleaner vehicles and bring significant health and environmental benefits to all Virginians. That is why the General Assembly adopted them,\" said Trip Pollard, a senior attorney with the SELC. \"The governor tried to get the legislature to repeal the law and failed; he cannot just dictate a different outcome.\"\n\nPollard said his group would \"take every action\" to keep the standards in place.\n\nThe Virginia Automobile Dealers Association, which supported Virginia's adoption of the California standards, said it's now supporting the move away from them.\n\n\"Our support for the California Air Resources Board standards was done to drive demand for fully electric vehicles in Virginia and support dealer interests, as doing so put the commonwealth in a stronger position for manufacturers to send EVs to our dealers and consumers,\" Don Hall, the group's president and CEO, said in a news release. \"The reality, however, is that consumer demand for EVs in Virginia and nationally has not yet materialized, compounded by costs, 'range anxiety,' and the lack of charging and electrical infrastructure to support these new vehicles. We continue to believe EV goals are achievable, but on a longer timeline.\"", "source": {"uri": "wydaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Williamsburg Yorktown Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Glenn Youngkin announced Wednesday.\n\nThat's when California's current mandate is superseded by new California Air Resources Board targets.\n\nThe new California mandates step up the pace to require that all new car, truck and SUV sales be zero emission vehicles by 2035, with 35% of new sales being electric vehicles in model year 2026.\n\nAutomakers would be fined $20,000 for each non EV sold over those targets.\n\nYoungkin said an official opinion from Attorney General Jason Miyares says a 2021 Virginia law adopting the current California standard does not require accepting the new one.\n\nThe California standard Virginia adopted with its 2021 legislation set up a credit system under which carmakers earned a credit for each zero-emission - read electric vehicle - they sold.\n\nThese were to grow from 4.5% of their California new vehicle sales in 2018 to 20% in 2025 and beyond. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency gave states the option of adopting its own standards or the stricter California ones. Virginia had opted for the California requirements.\n\nYoungkin noted that with EVs accounting for 9% of vehicles sold in Virginia last year, California-mandated fines would result in hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties that would be passed on to consumers.\n\n\"Once again, Virginia is declaring independence - this time from a misguided electric vehicle mandate imposed by unelected leaders nearly 3,000 miles away,\" Youngkin said.\n\n\"The idea that government should tell people what kind of car they can or can't purchase is fundamentally wrong,\" he said.\n\nMiyares' opinion letter says the language of the 2021 law in effect says Virginia may adopt the final California regulations, not that it must.\n\nThat means that the state is no longer legally bound to follow the California emission standards, he said.\n\n\"EV mandates like California's are unworkable and out of touch with reality, and thankfully the law does not bind us to their regulations,\" he said.\n\n\"California does not control which cars Virginians buy and any thoughts that automobile manufacturers should face millions of dollars in civil penalties rather than allowing our citizens to choose their own vehicles is completely absurd.\"\n\nEnvironmental groups criticize move\n\nMichael Town, Executive Director of the Virginia League of Conservation Voters, said the EV move, like Youngkin's decision to pull Virginia from the multi-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative to reduce carbon emission, ignores the dangers of climate change.\n\n\"Taking away one of our best tools to protect Virginians from power plant pollution wasn't enough,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"Now, Governor Youngkin wants Virginians to keep breathing tailpipe pollution too, despite laws on the books mandating the Commonwealth to tackle both of these major drivers of the climate crisis and detriments to public health.\"\n\nOther environmental groups were quick to respond,\n\n\"Governor Youngkin's attempt to wave his hand and dismiss Virginia's Clean Cars law is illegal, shortsighted, and bad public policy,\" said Trip Pollard, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center.\n\nConnor Kish, director of the Sierra Club Virginia Chapter, said the move \"is further proof that Governor Youngkin thinks he can sidestep the laws he doesn't like.\"\n\nAuto dealers back longer timeline\n\nBut Don Hall, president and chief executive office of the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association, said the new California standards can't be met in Virginia by 2035.\n\nWhile the association supported the 2021 law, seeing it as a way to encourage automakers to make the Virginia market a priority for EV shipments, \"The reality, however, is that consumer demand for EVs in Virginia and nationally has not yet materialized, compounded by costs, \"range anxiety,\" and the lack of charging and electrical infrastructure to support these new vehicles,\" Hall said.\n\n\"We continue to believe EV goals are achievable, but on a longer timeline,\" he said.\n\nDriving Force Action, a political action committee representing car enthusiasts and automotive business, called Youngkin's move a victory for Virginians.\n\n\"California's unilateral ban on gas-powered cars imposes additional financial risks and burdens on all Virginians by taking away our ability to choose what car is best for us, said spokesman Scot Crockett.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity Virginia State Director Matt Davison said while electric cars should be an option, people should not be forced to buy them.\n\n\"Robbing Virginians of their decision rights and handing them over to California bureaucrats and lawmakers is reprehensible, and today's announcement is a relief for every Virginian,\" he said.\n\nLegislation to repeal the 2021 law died in this year's General Assembly.\n\n\"We know that electric vehicles are already taking off,\" said Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth.\n\n\"The demand for them is just growing more each year. If Virginians can't find electric cars in their local dealerships, they will go out of state to buy their cars,\" he said, \"The Governor is taking us backwards.\"", "source": {"uri":

Glenn Youngkin's office announced Wednesday.\n\n\"Once again, Virginia is declaring independence - this time from a misguided electric vehicle mandate imposed by unelected leaders nearly 3,000 miles away from the Commonwealth,\" Youngkin said in a statement.\n\nThough Youngkin has fought green energy mandates established by the prior administration - most notably, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative - the announcement comes as a surprise, as it was believed that this decision was in the hands of the General Assembly.\n\nYoungkin encouraged state lawmakers at the start of this year's legislative session to repeal the 2021 law tying Virginia's vehicle emissions policies to California's, but the bill never made it out of committee due to the Assembly's Democratic majority.\n\nBut commonwealth Attorney General Jason Miyares has issued what is sure to be a highly contested official opinion \"confirm[ing] that Virginia is not required to comply with expansive new mandates adopted by the unelected California Air Resources Board (CARB) set to take effect January 1, 2025.\"\n\nThe governor held a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, proudly declaring Virginia's emancipation from California policy.\n\n\"I have the privilege of announcing once and for all the California electric vehicle mandate in Virginia. The idea that governments should be telling Virginians what kind of car they must drive is just simply wrong,\" Youngkin said.\n\nFederal law limits state autonomy regarding vehicle emissions: States must adhere to federal vehicle emissions standards, or they can choose to adopt California's more stringent standards.\n\nIn 2021, under a Democratic governor and a Democratic majority in the General Assembly, Virginia passed several bills that dramatically changed the state's energy and environmental landscape. One was the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which committed to transitioning Virginia's electric grid entirely to green energy by 2050, and another hitched Virginia's electric vehicle policies to California's.\n\nCalifornia requires 100% of new car sales to be zero-emission vehicles by 2035 and can fine automakers that fail to comply.\n\nRepublicans have bucked against the mandates since they came to Virginia but have been unable to reverse them through the legislative process. But Miyares seems confident that he has found a legal loophole.\n\nIn 2012, California adopted its Advanced Clean Car Program I, regulating vehicle emissions standards from 2015 to 2025. In 2022, California adopted the Advanced Clean Cars II.\n\n\"Virginia's air pollution control board has never approved, never adopted these ACCII (Advanced Clean Car Program II) regulations and because there was an explicit sunset provision placed on ACCI, it expires on December 31 of this year,\" Miyares said.\n\nMiyares also pointed to \"permissive\" language in the Virginia law referring to the first program, ACCI, which allowed the commonwealth to abandon California's clean cars policies in 2025.\n\n\"I can reach no other conclusion as the attorney general of Virginia that the provisions tying us to California ACCII are no longer operable and yes, Virginians, yet again, have consumer freedom,\" Miyares said.\n\nRepublicans are voicing their support for the move, grateful the commonwealth's environmental policies will no longer be tied to California's.\n\n\"Virginians, not unelected bureaucrats in California, should be able to choose the cars that fit their families needs,\" Republican Senate Majority Leader Michael McDougle posted on X.\n\n\"Outstanding!! This had to be one of the most ridiculous policy decisions forced on Virginians when the Democrats took complete control of government in 2020/2021,\" Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper, posted on X.\n\nVirginia Democrats have yet to issue an official response to the news.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"},

It required that starting in 2024 a certain percentage of new passenger vehicles sold by manufacturers be electric or hybrid electric. Last year, Virginia Senate Democrats defeated several Republican efforts to repeal the law.\n\nThe mechanism for reaching the mandated vehicle sales threshold involved adopting California\u00b4s vehicle emissions standards. California has had the authority to set its own rules for decades under a waiver from the federal Clean Air Act.\n\nThe program applies to manufacturers, not car dealers.

Glenn Youngkin has pledged to return Virginia to federal vehicle emissions standards, three years after the state's Democratic-led legislature passed a law committing the state to follow more stringent emissions rules set by California.\n\n\"The idea that government should be telling Virginians what kind of car they must drive is just simply wrong,\" said Youngkin Wednesday afternoon at a press conference held at a Toyota dealership south of Richmond. \"The idea that unelected bureaucrats in California should be deciding for Virginians what car they drive is wrong.\"\n\nBut environmental groups say the governor's move is an illegal overreach of his powers, one that attempts to circumvent a law he finds distasteful but that his party has so far failed to undo in the legislature.\n\n\"It's interesting that after three years of trying to get the General Assembly to repeal the law, they suddenly decided that the General Assembly doesn't have to repeal the law. They can just do it themselves,\" said Trip Pollard, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, which previously lobbied for passage of the legislation.\n\nAs part of a broader Democratic push to reduce carbon emissions, the Virginia General Assembly in 2021 voted to join more than a dozen other states in following vehicle standards set by California, which under the Clean Air Act is allowed to institute its own rules for limiting pollution from tailpipes.\n\nThose rules impose binding targets for not only reducing emissions from gas-powered cars but also increasing the number of electric vehicles sold in a state each year. In Virginia, they went into effect this January after the end of a federally imposed two-year waiting period.\n\nFederal law gives states the option of choosing either federal or California standards to limit vehicle emissions but prohibits them from crafting other legal frameworks.\n\nVirginia Republicans have balked at the California standards, particularly after the California Air Resources Board in August 2022 rolled out an even stricter pathway to emissions reductions known as Advanced Clean Cars II.\n\nRepublican Attorney General Jason Miyares, who has previously said that Virginia is bound by the 2021 law adopting California's standards, produced an official advisory opinion that says while Virginia may have been bound to the earlier California standards, state law and regulations do not require adoption of the more stringent framework introduced in August 2022.\n\nUnder those more stringent 2022 standards, 35 percent of model year 2026 cars sold in participating states would need to be zero emission, and the sale of new gas-powered cars would be banned beginning in 2035. (CARB rules do not apply to used car sales.) Manufacturers that don't comply with the targets could face fines.\n\nThe Youngkin administration has criticized the new timeline as \"unworkable\" and an unjust restriction of personal rights, pointing out that only 9 percent of vehicles sold in Virginia last year were electric.\n\n\"When today 90 percent of automobiles in Virginia that are purchased aren't electric vehicles, to turn around and mandate that 35 percent of them have to be electric vehicles imposes an extraordinary economic burden on our dealers and on Virginians,\" Youngkin said.\n\nPollard said the reality is more nuanced: Car manufacturers can both bank and pool credits to help meet the new targets, and no manufacturer has been fined for failing to meet them since the Advanced Clean Cars program began in California in 2012.\n\nNevertheless, the new goals have caused concern among Virginia car dealers. While the influential Virginia Automobile Dealers Association threw its support behind the 2021 law joining Virginia to California, on Wednesday its members declared that a longer timeline was needed to transition away from gas-powered cars.\n\n\"While the interest in electric vehicles is rising, it's not yet at the level where these unreasonable California mandates expect them to be,\" said Tim Pohanka, a Northern Virginia auto dealer and VADA legislative chair, at Wednesday's press conference. \"Forcing EV demand before the market is ready could have detrimental effects on both consumers and dealers.\"\n\nBut Pollard said the Youngkin administration has offered no viable alternative to the standards.\n\n\"Transportation is the number one source of climate pollution,\" he said. \"There hasn't been any serious proposals to show how else we would get this type of reduction in tailpipe pollution.\"\n\nYoungkin on Wednesday downplayed criticisms that decoupling from the California standards meant that the administration isn't being proactive about environmental issues and praised electric vehicles, which he said he supports but does not believe should be mandated.\n\n\"The federal government emission standards are incredibly aggressive, and they do require manufacturers to deliver fleets at a substantial continued reduction of emissions over time,\" he said. \"And I will bet on American innovation every single day that they will find a way to meet it.\"\n\nDespite Republicans' unhappiness with the California standards, officials previously concluded legislation was necessary to return the state to the federal standards. In August 2022, an assistant attorney general penned an email concluding Virginia was \"bound\" by the 2021 law. Decoupling the state from the California standards would require \"an amendment or repeal of the mandating legislation,\" he wrote.\n\nAttorney General Miyares' office expressed a similar view at the time, saying the law \"binds Virginia to California's vehicle emission regulations\" and urging the General Assembly to repeal it.\n\nBut in the official advisory opinion he issued this week, at the request of Youngkin and Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle (R-Hanover), Miyares took a starkly different view, finding that state law and regulations do not require adoption of the more stringent California framework.\n\nBecause Virginia's 2021 law and related regulations \"reference code sections\" of California law that will no longer be operable after Dec. 31, Virginia's tie to the California standards \"expires\" at the end of the year, he said Wednesday.\n\nMiyares' argument hinges on the first line of the 2021 law, which says the state's Air Pollution Control Board \"may adopt by regulation and enforce any model year standards relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles.\" While that language permits the board to adopt the California standards, he said, it doesn't mandate that it must.\n\nIn his opinion, the attorney general acknowledges the law continues: It says the board \"shall promulgate final regulations for an Advanced Clean Cars Program\" and that it \"shall periodically amend any regulations ... to ensure continued consistency of such standards with the Clean Air Act.\"\n\nBut, Miyares wrote, \"the word 'shall' is not to be interpreted in isolation.\" Because the mandatory language follows the statement that the board \"may\" adopt such regulations, he concluded that those orders are only \"conditionally mandatory at most.\"\n\nThat view is a departure from how the state's Department of Environmental Quality has previously interpreted the law. A December 2021 presentation to the Air Pollution Control Board, which occurred a little over a month before Youngkin took office, noted the Virginia rule \"automatically updates\" to conform with California changes.\n\nBut in a Wednesday memorandum, Virginia Secretary of Natural Resources Travis Voyles wrote that \"Virginia would have needed to take affirmative action to\" adopt the new regulations. Because the board has not yet done so, the state must decouple from California by the end of the year, he informed agencies.\n\nEnvironmental groups like the Virginia League of Conservation Voters drew parallels between the abandonment of the California standards and Youngkin's efforts to withdraw Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a multistate carbon market that the state joined when it was under Democratic control in 2021. After Republicans repeatedly failed to get legislation pulling Virginia out of RGGI through Democratic-controlled committees, Youngkin moved to do so through the regulatory process. That decision is currently being challenged in Floyd County Circuit Court, with the Southern Environmental Law Center representing several opponents.\n\n\"Taking away one of our best tools to protect Virginians from power plant pollution wasn't enough. Now, Governor Youngkin wants Virginians to keep breathing tailpipe pollution too, despite laws on the books mandating the Commonwealth to tackle both of these major drivers of the climate crisis and detriments to public health,\" said Michael Town, executive director of the League, in a statement.\n\nPollard, too, said the decision is part of a \"pattern of executive overreach.\"\n\n\"I think the General Assembly has made their decisions very clear,\" the Southern Environmental Law Center attorney said. \"I also think it's just bad policy.\"\n\nMiyares, though, said his office was willing to defend the decision.\n\n\"We can obviously debate this in the court, but our office is very confident in both our in-depth legal analysis and our conclusions,\" he said.", "source": {"uri":

Glenn Youngkin campaigns for New York Republican gubernatorial nominee Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) in Thornwood, Westchester, New York on Oct. 31, 2022. (Chung I Ho/The Epoch Times)\n\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced his state will stop following California's standards that would mandate that every new car sold in the state be electric by 2035.\n\nIn a news release issued Wednesday, the Republican governor said he made the decision due to what he described as a \"misguided electric vehicle mandate imposed by unelected leaders nearly 3,000 miles away from the Commonwealth\" of Virginia.\n\n\"The idea that government should tell people what kind of car they can or can't purchase is fundamentally wrong. Virginians deserve the freedom to choose which vehicles best fit the needs of their families and businesses,\" he said. \"The law is clear, and I am proud to announce Virginians will no longer be forced to live under this out-of-touch policy.\"\n\nLawmakers in Virginia passed a measure in 2021 that aligned the state's car emissions rules with California's rules. In 2022, the California Air Resources Board initiated a measure that would gradually ban the sale of new gas-powered vehicles in the state before banning them in their entirety by 2035. The gradual ban would start in January 2025.\n\nIn California, 35 percent of new cars will be required to be electric vehicles by 2026. Manufacturers that sell a gas-powered car that doesn't comply with state standards could be fined up to $20,000 per car.\n\nHowever, according to the governor's office, only 9 percent of all vehicles sold in the commonwealth last year were fully electric vehicles, meaning that \"hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties\" could be doled out in the near future.\n\n\"Virginia auto consumers and dealers could be forced to bear these costs. Not only would this leave auto dealers with less money to pay staff, offer raises, and grow their businesses, it could force many small auto dealers to permanently close their doors,\" the news release said.\n\nAn opinion from Attorney General Jason Miyares said that the law doesn't require Virginia to follow the California regulation. Instead, the commonwealth will follow federal regulation standards, starting on Jan. 1, 2025, he said.\n\n\"Thankfully the law does not bind us to their regulations,\" he wrote. \"California does not control which cars Virginians buy and any thoughts that automobile manufacturers should face millions of dollars in civil penalties rather than allowing our citizens to choose their own vehicles is completely absurd.\"\n\nIn a statement, the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) signaled that it would challenge Mr. Youngkin's decision in court, describing it as \"illegal.\"\n\n\"Governor Youngkin's attempt to wave his hand and dismiss Virginia's Clean Cars law is illegal, shortsighted, and bad public policy,\" Trip Pollard, with SELC, said in a statement. \"The Clean Cars standards will help spur the transition to cleaner vehicles and bring significant health and environmental benefits to all Virginians. That is why the General Assembly adopted them. The Governor tried to get the legislature to repeal the law and failed; he cannot just dictate a different outcome.\"\n\nThe Virginia Automobile Dealers Association, which backs Mr. Youngkin's decision, said that it previously supported the adoption of the California emissions standards but has now backed away because \"consumer demand for EVs\" isn't there.\n\nThe group said in a statement Wednesday that their previous support was \"done to drive demand for fully electric vehicles in Virginia and support dealer interests,\" but \"reality\" then set in.\n\n\"The reality, however, is that consumer demand for EVs in Virginia and nationally has not yet materialized, compounded by costs, 'range anxiety,' and the lack of charging and electrical infrastructure to support these new vehicles. We continue to believe EV goals are achievable, but on a longer timeline,\" it added.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have said that Mr. Youngkin is overstepping his authority as governor. On Wednesday, state House Majority Leader Charniele Herring said that his effort to remove the California-aligned mandate is trying to circumvent legislature passed in the commonwealth.\n\n\"He's showing his complete disregard for existing law by going around the General Assembly and pandering to corporate polluters,\" she told the Washington Post.\n\n\"The governor seems to think we live in a dictatorship where only he decides what the law is,\" Senate Majority Leader Scott A. Surovell, a Democrat, told the paper. He added that the governor's move will be \"destructive of Virginia's pro-business reputation.\"\n\nState Sen. Barbara Favola, a Democrat, told WUSA9 that \"this is not a California mandate. This is a Virginia mandate that the governor is trying to overrule.\"\n\n\"So, what he's doing is trying to make the standards that the Virginia lawmakers adopted, he's trying to make them look extreme,\" she added.\n\nThe Epoch Times has contacted the Democratic Party of Virginia for comment.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Historically, the California standards have been the stricter of the two.\n\nIn 2021, prior to Mr. Youngkin taking office, the Virginia Assembly voted in favor of adopting the California standards, which have higher standards for cars in terms of limiting nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, greenhouse gas, and particulate emission.\n\nAccording to the Virginia attorney general, Jason Miyares, Virginia is no longer required to follow the California standards, as laid out in the 2021 law. \"Today, I've issued an official Attorney General Opinion that confirms that Virginians are no longer legally bound to follow the emission standards of California,\" Mr. Miyares said.\n\nThe attorney general explained in an opinion, the 2021 law required Virginia to adopt the emissions standards set forth in California \"Advanced Clean Cars I\" but that the state was not required to adopt the standards set forth in \"Advanced Clean Cars II,\" which is set to require all new cars sold in California to be zero emission by 2035.\n\n\"EV mandates like California's are unworkable and out of touch with reality, and thankfully the law does not bind us to their regulations,\" Mr. Miyares

Virginians deserve the freedom to choose which vehicles best fit the needs of their families and businesses. The law is clear, and I am proud to announce Virginians will no longer be forced to live under this out-of-touch policy.\"\n\n\"Today, I've issued an official Attorney General Opinion that confirms that Virginians are no longer legally bound to follow the emission standards of California,\" said Attorney General Jason Miyares. \"EV mandates like California's are unworkable and out of touch with reality, and thankfully the law does not bind us to their regulations. California does not control which cars Virginians buy and any thoughts that automobile manufacturers should face millions of dollars in civil penalties rather than allowing our citizens to choose their own vehicles is completely absurd.\"\n\nIn 2021, the Virginia General Assembly passed legislation authorizing Virginia's Air Board to adopt California's \"Advanced Clean Cars I\" regulation pursuant to Section 177 of the federal Clean Air Act. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) recently adopted \"Advanced Clean Cars II,\" set to take effect January 1, 2025, which would require 100% of new cars sold in Model Year 2035 to be electric vehicles. An opinion from Attorney General Jason Miyares confirms the law, as written, does not require Virginia to follow ACC II. Therefore, the Commonwealth will follow federal emissions standards on January 1, 2025.\n\n\"Throughout CARB's 'Advanced Clean Cars II' regulation are references to California Governor Gavin Newsom's executive orders and the unique environmental circumstances facing California. Virginia's laws should not be determined by California politicians. Instead, our laws should be decided by Virginians who are elected to serve Virginia and address issues that face our Commonwealth, not a state nearly 3,000 miles away,\" said Senator Ryan McDougle, who co-patroned legislation to repeal CARB's mandate during this year's legislative session along with Senator Richard Stuart, Senator John McGuire, Delegate Lee Ware, Delegate Tony Wilt, and Delegate Buddy Fowler.\n\nUnder Advanced Clean Cars II, beginning in Model Year 2026, 35% of the new cars sold would have been required to be electric vehicles, moving up to 100% in 2035. If an auto manufacturer sells a standard automobile out of compliance with California's mandate, they may be required to pay a fine upwards of $20,000 per vehicle sold. Given that EVs only amounted to 9% of vehicles sold in Virginia in 2023, application of the misguided mandates could have resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties. Virginia auto consumers and dealers could be forced to bear these costs. Not only would this leave auto dealers with less money to pay staff, offer raises, and grow their businesses, it could force many small auto dealers to permanently close their doors.\n\nThe Attorney General's opinion can be found here.\n\nA formal memo from Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources Travis Voyles to regulated entities and the Department of Environmental Quality can be found here.", "source": {"uri": "pcpatriot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PCPatriot"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Youngkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Youngkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Miyares", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Miyares"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Virginia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Virginia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Air_Resources_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California Air Resources Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virginia General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_House_of_Delegates", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virginia House of Delegates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Air_Act_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clean Air Act (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Fowler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buddy Fowler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stuart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard Stuart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGuire_(Virginia_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John McGuire (Virginia politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Wilt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Wilt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Ware", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lee Ware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_McDougle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan McDougle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_session", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legislative session"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image Galleries", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/pcpatriot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Gov-Glenn-Youngkin.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627271", "eventUri": "eng-9627271", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)\n\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said Wednesday that the state will no longer follow car emissions standards set by California, despite his party's failure to repeal or roll back a 2021 Democratic law that tied Virginia to those regulations.\n\nIn Senate, Va. Democrats kill Republican attempts to roll back vehicle emissions law\n\nThe move tees up what could be another legal fight over Republican leaders' efforts to undo climate change-related measures Democrats passed when they had full control of state government a few years ago.\n\nThe governor has already drawn a lawsuit over his decision to end Virginia's participation in a regional program meant to curb carbon emissions from power plants, arguing the initiative was too burdensome for regular Virginians who had to absorb the cost through higher electricity bills.\n\nYoungkin has taken a similar line of attack against California's car emissions rules, which aim to slow climate change and reduce pollution by requiring the automotive industry to shift to selling more electric vehicles. The California standards require 100% of new cars sold to be electric vehicles starting in 2035, meaning the sale of new gas-powered vehicles would gradually be banned over the next decade.\n\n\"Once again, Virginia is declaring independence - this time from a misguided electric vehicle mandate imposed by unelected leaders nearly 3,000 miles away from the Commonwealth,\" Youngkin said in a news release Wednesday morning. \"The idea that government should tell people what kind of car they can or can't purchase is fundamentally wrong.\"\n\nThe governor said Virginia would stop following regulations set by the California Air Resources Board at the end of 2024.\n\nThe move drew swift condemnation from Democrats who said Youngkin and Attorney General Jason Miyares, whose office provided legal cover for Youngkin's action, were overstepping their authority to try to undo a law they didn't like.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said \"even Vladimiir Putin does not claim to have this much power.\"\n\n\"Governor Youngkin and Attorney General Miyares' reckless, illegal and unconstitutional actions today are destructive of VIrginia's pro-business reputation,\" Surovell said in a written statement. \"Working with a legislature that has a different political orientation can be challenging, but we fought a war in 1776 to ensure that an executive would never have the powers to nullify laws by press conference.\"\n\nThe legal justification for Wednesday's announcement, laid out in a 9-page advisory opinion by Miyares, is that the first version of California's standards expire at the end of the year. Though they're being replaced with a new set of rules, Miyares opined that Virginia law doesn't strictly require Virginia's State Air Pollution Control Board to go along with the updated California standards.\n\nThe Federal Clean Air act requires states to either follow California's admissions rules or regulations set by the federal government. Individual states don't have the power to make their own rules, partly to avoid forcing the auto industry to make vehicles tailored to a complicated patchwork of laws that could vary from state to state. The most populous state in the nation, California was granted unique permission to craft its own regulations to address local air pollution issues.\n\nYoungkin said the state will follow the less-strict federal emissions rules starting in 2025. Those rules still encourage the transition to electric vehicles, but on a less aggressive timeline than what California envisioned.\n\n\"EV mandates like California's are unworkable and out of touch with reality, and thankfully the law does not bind us to their regulations,\" said Miyares, who's widely considered a possible GOP candidate for governor in 2025.\n\nThe new legal interpretation by Miyares contradicts an earlier position by his office. In a 2022 email, an assistant attorney general wrote that Virginia was \"bound\" to the California standards. Severing Virginia from California's rules, the assistant attorney wrote, would require \"an amendment or repeal of the mandating legislation.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers have introduced legislation aiming to do just that, but those bills have been blocked by Democrats who have controlled at least one General Assembly chamber ever since Youngkin took office. The legislative rollback efforts failed again this year now that Democrats control both the state Senate and the House of Delegates.\n\nIn a statement, the Southern Environmental Law Center called Youngkin's move \"illegal, shortsighted and bad public policy.\"\n\n\"The Clean Cars standards will help spur the transition to cleaner vehicles and bring significant health and environmental benefits to all Virginians. That is why the General Assembly adopted them,\" said Trip Pollard, a senior attorney with the SELC. \"The governor tried to get the legislature to repeal the law and failed; he cannot just dictate a different outcome.\"\n\nPollard said his group would \"take every action\" to keep the standards in place.\n\nThe Virginia Automobile Dealers Association, which supported Virginia's adoption of the California standards, said it's now supporting the move away from them.\n\n\"Our support for the California Air Resources Board standards was done to drive demand for fully electric vehicles in Virginia and support dealer interests, as doing so put the commonwealth in a stronger position for manufacturers to send EVs to our dealers and Consumers,\" Don Hall, the group's president and CEO, said in a news release. \"The reality, however, is that consumer demand for EVs in Virginia and nationally has not yet materialized, compounded by costs, 'range anxiety,' and the lack of charging and electrical infrastructure to support these new vehicles. We continue to believe EV goals are achievable, but on a longer timeline.\"\n\nEditor's note: This is a developing story and will be updated with new details as they emerge.", "source": {"uri":

In 2022, the California Air Resources Board adopted the Advanced Clean Cars II -- standards with much more stringent electric vehicle sales targets.\n\nACC II, which takes effect in January 2025, requires zero-emission vehicles to make up at least 22% of all new car sales in participating states by the end of the year. That share increases to 100% by 2035.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nBeginning next year, the mandate also imposes penalties on manufacturers that fail to meet the EV sales targets -- which Youngkin said Wednesday could be as high as $20,000 per vehicle sold.\n\nEVs currently account for just 9% of new car sales in Virginia, meaning that any penalty on manufacturers could cause significant economic harm.

Glenn Youngkin announced that the state would no longer be following California's lead in mandating the adoption of electric vehicles that very few people want.\n\nIn 2021, then-Gov. Ralph signed into law a bill that tied Virginia's Air Board to California's \"Advanced Clean Cars I\" regulation. But that regulation ends this year, supplanted by \"Advanced Clean Cars II.\"\n\nThe new rule goes into effect on Jan. 1, and will require that 35 percent of model year 2026 cars in California be electric -- and that percentage would rise annually, hitting 100 percent in 2035.\n\nAnd car dealers that knowingly violate the mandate would be subject to fines of $20,000 or more per vehicle.\n\nHowever, because of the wording of the Virginia law, the state is not required to adopt the new standards that California's government has decided to burden its residents with, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares said in an official opinion.\n\nBasically, the Virginia law states that the Air Board \"may\" adopt the new, stricter standards, and the word \"may\" implies that the Air Board also \"may not\" choose to do so.\n\n\"Once again, Virginia is declaring independence -- this time from a misguided electric vehicle mandate imposed by unelected leaders nearly 3,000 miles away from the Commonwealth,\" Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in a statement from his office.\n\n\"The idea that government should tell people what kind of car they can or can't purchase is fundamentally wrong,\" he added. \"Virginians deserve the freedom to choose which vehicles best fit the needs of their families and businesses. The law is clear, and I am proud to announce Virginians will no longer be forced to live under this out-of-touch policy.\"\n\nMiyares agreed.\n\n\"Today, I've issued an official Attorney General Opinion that confirms that Virginians are no longer legally bound to follow the emission standards of California,\" he said in the same statement. \"EV mandates like California's are unworkable and out of touch with reality, and thankfully the law does not bind us to their regulations.\n\n\"California does not control which cars Virginians buy and any thoughts that automobile manufacturers should face millions of dollars in civil penalties rather than allowing our citizens to choose their own vehicles is completely absurd,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, a poll published Tuesday by The Associated Press showed that the two men's thinking about electric vehicles was in line with a plurality of Americans.\n\n\"About 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they would be at least somewhat likely to buy an EV the next time they buy a car, according to the poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, while 46% say they are not too likely or not at all likely to purchase one,\" the AP reported.\n\nWorse, only 32 percent of adults over 45 -- you know, the ones with the money -- say they're \"somewhat\" likely to buy an EV next time they're in the market for a car.\n\nAnd those numbers are likely exaggerated, as many respondents either said they'd consider an EV because the left has been screaming at them about how that's the only responsible thing to do, or said they'd \"consider\" it the same way I would -- for about eight seconds, before I move along to the gas-powered cars. At least until issues like battery life, charging infrastructure and cost are dealt with.\n\nThe outlet noted that President Joe Biden's push to force Americans to adopt electric vehicles despite their reluctance to do so may cause him problems in an election year.\n\nHis presumptive opponent, former President Donald Trump, has already been turning into an issue in the 2024 presidential campaign, the AP reported.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_dealership", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Car dealership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Youngkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Youngkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Miyares", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Miyares"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_Virginia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of Virginia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth of Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2024_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_(voting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plurality (voting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit_Cars_and_Replicas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit Cars and Replicas", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image Galleries", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.westernjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/electric-vehicles.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627271", "eventUri": "eng-9627271", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-01", "textStart": 483, "textEnd": 489}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

According to the California Air Resources Board (CARB) plan, 35% of all new cars sold in California in 2026 are to to be electric or hybrids, with the amount climbing to 68% by 2030, and 100% by 2035. Following California's official 2022 announcement, many other states quickly joined California either due to quick acting state legislatures or trigger laws that would bind them to standards in the Golden state. New York was the first to follow California, creating their own California style 2035 zero emission vehicle law in September 2022.\n\nBy May 2024, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia, all set in similar gas-powered sale bans. In addition, both Connecticut and Maine are also close to adopting the standards, with Colorado, Delaware, Minnesota, and New Mexico all adopting partial standards. Conversely, some states outright rejected California's 2035 law, with some, such as Wyoming, actually introducing legislation trying to ban the sale of electric cars instead.\n\nIn the case of Virginia, they have been following California's emissions plans since 2021, when state officials decided to follow California's emissions policies, which are stricter than the federal EPA standards. However, the election of Governor Youngkin in 2022, as well an increase in GOP lawmakers elected in the state since 2021, resulted in Virginia questioning the emissions regulations. Youngkin has signaled recently that California's regulations take away the consumers freedom to choose what kid of car they want. The Virginia GOP specifically said that the gas-powered ban is too extremist and that Republicans needed to be elected in to undo the damage.\n\nWith state regulations expected to ramp up soon to have 22% of all car sales be electric in 2025, and current regulations set to expire at the end of the year, Youngkin took action, and on Wednesday, announced the end of the California electric vehicle mandate in Virginia.\n\n\"Once again, Virginia is declaring independence - this time from a misguided electric vehicle mandate imposed by unelected leaders nearly 3,000 miles away from the Commonwealth,\" said Youngkin in a statement on Wednesday. \"The idea that government should tell people what kind of car they can or can't purchase is fundamentally wrong. Virginians deserve the freedom to choose which vehicles best fit the needs of their families and businesses. The law is clear, and I am proud to announce Virginians will no longer be forced to live under this out-of-touch policy.\"\n\nVirginia Attorney General Jason Miyares added, \"Today, I've issued an official Attorney General Opinion that confirms that Virginians are no longer legally bound to follow the emission standards of California. EV mandates like California's are unworkable and out of touch with reality, and thankfully the law does not bind us to their regulations. California does not control which cars Virginians buy and any thoughts that automobile manufacturers should face millions of dollars in civil penalties rather than allowing our citizens to choose their own vehicles is completely absurd.\"\n\nWhile Virginia is now in the process of exiting the agreement, nothing is yet finalized. Youngkin has set for the state to leave the California 2035 standards by the end of the year. However, state legislators in Virginia said on Wednesday that they would be fighting the Governor on this.\n\n\"The decision is reckless, illegal and unconstitutional,\" said Democratic Virginia Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell. \"Working with a legislature that has a different political orientation can be challenging, but we fought a war in 1776 to ensure that an executive would never have the power to nullify laws by press conference.\"\n\nVirginia to end 2035 gas powered car sales ban mandate\n\nCalifornia lawmakers, including 2035 gas powered vehicle ban proponent Governor Newsom, have yet to comment on Virginia's decision as of Wednesday morning. However, those in the auto industry noted that while Virginia seems to be pulling away, few other states that have signed on with California's regulations have signaled that they want out as well.\n\n\"If you look at the list of states that followed California, or are looking to, Virginia was the only swing-state there,\" Michigan-based auto industry analyst Kevin Pullman told the Globe on Wednesday. \"If any of those states was going to pull out, it would be Virginia thanks to the GOP coming back into power in the state after 2022.\n\n\"I'm not sure if any states will follow at least immediately, but Virginia has also now set a precedent. Not everyone has to follow California, and can stop at any time. Outside of the West and Northeast, we won't see this pop up too much. But what Virginia did is big. States can decide to get out of the 2035 mandate. Even California can end it if they wanted to. It is not only possible to get out of it, but it is now being done. That is something that supporters of the plan did not want. Newsom hasn't said anything on this yet, but you can bet that he is at least a little bit furious at states now dropping out of his mandate. Electric cars are the future, but that 2035 date is cutting it close for many, with many states not even having the infrastructure to support a lot of electric cars yet. And many states are looking at slower rollouts or situations where both can be sold.:\n\n\"Many states had already though that California's mandate wasn't so great, and now we have the first drop out.\"\n\nCalifornia lawmakers are expected to give announcements on Virginia's decision later today.\n\nAuthor Recent Posts Evan SymonEvan V.

Glenn Youngkin said Wednesday his administration will withdraw Virginia from a plan to follow strict car emissions standards set by California.\n\nThe move, which will take effect when current standards expire at the end of 2024, drew applause from gasoline and auto dealer trade groups and condemnation from Virginia Democrats and environmental groups, who said the administration was overstepping its authority.\n\nIn an announcement, Youngkin said Virginia will not follow new California rules set to take effect in 2025, which mandate all new cars, trucks and SUVs sold in the state to run on electricity or hydrogen by 2035.\n\n\"Once again, Virginia is declaring independence -- this time from a misguided electric vehicle mandate imposed by unelected leaders nearly 3,000 miles away from the commonwealth,\" Youngkin said in the announcement. \"The idea that government should tell people what kind of car they can or can't purchase is fundamentally wrong.\"\n\nDemocrats signed Virginia onto the California clean car standards in 2021. If the state did not adopt the California standards, it would still have to meet less stringent federal standards, which require 56% of new vehicles sold to be electric by 2032. The standards attempt to slow climate change by forcing a switch to cleaner electric vehicles.\n\nYoungkin and Virginia Republicans have failed to repeal or scale back the 2021 legislation.\n\nTo justify the move to abandon the California standards, Youngkin cited a legal opinion from Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares.\n\nIn the 9-page opinion, Miyares wrote the 2021 Virginia law authorized the state to follow an older version of the California standards, which expire at the end of the year. New California standards are set to take effect next year, but Miyares said Virginia is not bound to adhere to those. Miyares' office told the Associated Press that the 2021 law bound Virginia to the California standards.\n\nAt an event Wednesday in Chester, Miyares defended his reversal by saying the 2021 law used permissive language rather than language that commands.\n\n\"The General Assembly members are free to introduce a new bill that tries to take this from being permissive to being mandatory,\" said Miyares, a former Virginia Beach delegate. \"They're welcome to have that debate.\"\n\nThe decision drew condemnation from Virginia Democratic leaders. In a news release, Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell of Fairfax accused Youngkin of nullifying laws by press conference.\n\n\"The clean energy economy creates good high-paying jobs and helps us protect our environment,\" added House Speaker Don Scott of Portsmouthcq comment=\"cq\" ]. \"The Governor is taking us backwards.\"\n\nThe move marks the latest Youngkin effort to undo environmental standards adopted by Democrats when they controlled the General Assembly. At the governor's behest, a state board voted last year to withdraw Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.\n\nAn automobile dealership group with several Hampton Roads members applauded Youngkin's decision, saying demand for electric vehicles had not materialized. The group originally supported the 2021 law.\n\n\"We respectfully have come to the point where we believe Virginia should uncouple itself from these standards at this time,\" said Don Hall, president and CEO of the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association. \"The lack of bipartisan support and funding for the standards means an unfunded mandate is weighing down Virginia with goals that are impossible to attain in the 2035 timeframe, as currently required.\"\n\nAround 97,000 electric vehicles are on the road in Virginia as of 2023, according to data collected by the Drive Electric Virginia initiative.\n\nThe leader of a gasoline trade group also congratulated Youngkin.\n\n\"We welcome Virginia into the growing number of states -- both red and blue -- that have rejected California's ban on sales of new gas-powered cars and trucks,\" said Chet Thompson, American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers president and CEO, in a news release.\n\nEnvironmental groups derided the decision as illegal and short-sighted. Trip Pollard, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said Youngkin and Republicans had spent three years unsuccessfully trying to reverse the law.\n\n\"So, it's interesting that after three years of attempts to repeal it, they suddenly decided that the governor could unilaterally repeal it,\" Pollard said.\n\nWhen asked if a lawsuit was likely to follow this action, Pollard said his group was looking at all available options.\n\nChesapeake Bay Foundation Virginia Staff Attorney Patrick Fanning said in a statement that Miyares' opinion misinterprets the law, which he said requires the Air Pollution Control Board to both adopt and update clean car standards.", "source": {"uri": "pilotonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Virginian Pilot"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Glenn Youngkin announced his state will stop following California's standards that would mandate that every new car sold in the state be electric by 2035.\n\nIn a news release issued Wednesday, the Republican governor said he made the decision due to what he described as a \"misguided electric vehicle mandate imposed by unelected leaders nearly 3,000 miles away from the Commonwealth\" of Virginia.\n\n\"The idea that government should tell people what kind of car they can or can't purchase is fundamentally wrong. Virginians deserve the freedom to choose which vehicles best fit the needs of their families and businesses,\" he said. \"The law is clear, and I am proud to announce Virginians will no longer be forced to live under this out-of-touch policy.\"\n\nLawmakers in Virginia passed a measure in 2021 that aligned the state's car emissions rules with California's rules. In 2022, the California Air Resources Board initiated a measure that would gradually ban the sale of new gas-powered vehicles in the state before banning them in their entirety by 2035. The gradual ban would start in January 2025.\n\nIn California, 35 percent of new cars will be required to be electric vehicles by 2026. Manufacturers that sell a gas-powered car that doesn't comply with state standards could be fined up to $20,000 per car.\n\nHowever, according to the governor's office, only 9 percent of all vehicles sold in the commonwealth last year were fully electric vehicles, meaning that \"hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties\" could be doled out in the near future.\n\n\"Virginia auto consumers and dealers could be forced to bear these costs. Not only would this leave auto dealers with less money to pay staff, offer raises, and grow their businesses, it could force many small auto dealers to permanently close their doors,\" the news release said.\n\nAn opinion from Attorney General Jason Miyares said that the law doesn't require Virginia to follow the California regulation. Instead, the commonwealth will follow federal regulation standards, starting on Jan. 1, 2025, he said.\n\n\"Governor Youngkin's attempt to wave his hand and dismiss Virginia's Clean Cars law is illegal, shortsighted, and bad public policy,\" Trip Pollard, with SELC, said in a statement. \"The Clean Cars standards will help spur the transition to cleaner vehicles and bring significant health and environmental benefits to all Virginians. That is why the General Assembly adopted them. The Governor tried to get the legislature to repeal the law and failed; he cannot just dictate a different outcome.\"\n\nThe Virginia Automobile Dealers Association, which backs Mr. Youngkin's decision, said that it previously supported the adoption of the California emissions standards but has now backed away because \"consumer demand for EVs\" isn't there.\n\n\"The reality, however, is that consumer demand for EVs in Virginia and nationally has not yet materialized, compounded by costs, 'range anxiety,' and the lack of charging and electrical infrastructure to support these new vehicles. We continue to believe EV goals are achievable, but on a longer timeline,\" it added.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have said that Mr. Youngkin is overstepping his authority as governor. On Wednesday, state House Majority Leader Charniele Herring said that his effort to remove the California-aligned mandate is trying to circumvent legislature passed in the commonwealth.\n\n\"He's showing his complete disregard for existing law by going around the General Assembly and pandering to corporate polluters,\" she told the Washington Post.\n\n\"The governor seems to think we live in a dictatorship where only he decides what the law is,\" Senate Majority Leader Scott A. Surovell, a Democrat, told the paper. He added that the governor's move will be \"destructive of Virginia's pro-business reputation.\"\n\n\"So, what he's doing is trying to make the standards that the Virginia lawmakers adopted, he's trying to make them look extreme,\" she added.\n\nThe Epoch Times has contacted the Democratic Party of Virginia for comment.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Youngkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Youngkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_(U.S._state)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth (U.S. state)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Air_Resources_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California Air Resources Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth of Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Miyares", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Miyares"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charniele_Herring", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charniele Herring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epoch Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_Virginia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party of Virginia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Surovell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott Surovell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Range anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Import and Export", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image Galleries", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/05/18/id5652656-GettyImages-1780394534-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627271", "eventUri": "eng-9627271", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

At the governor's behest, a state board voted last year to withdraw Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.\n\nAn automobile dealership group with several Hampton Roads members applauded Youngkin's decision, saying demand for electric vehicles had not materialized. The group originally supported the 2021 law.\n\n\"We respectfully have come to the point where we believe Virginia should uncouple itself from these standards at this time,\" said Don Hall, president and CEO of the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association. \"The lack of bipartisan support and funding for the standards means an unfunded mandate is weighing down Virginia with goals that are impossible to attain in the 2035 timeframe, as currently required.\"\n\nAround 97,000 electric vehicles are on the road in Virginia as of 2023, according to data collected by the Drive Electric Virginia initiative.\n\nThe leader of a gasoline trade group also congratulated Youngkin on the move.\n\n\"We welcome Virginia into the growing number of states -- both red and blue -- that have rejected California's ban on sales of new gas-powered cars and trucks,\" said Chet Thompson, American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers president and CEO, in a news release.\n\nEnvironmental groups derided the Youngkin decision as illegal and short-sighted. Trip Pollard, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said Youngkin and Republicans had spent three years unsuccessfully trying to reverse the law.\n\n\"So, it's interesting that after three years of attempts to repeal it, they suddenly decided that the governor could unilaterally repeal it,\" Pollard said.\n\nWhen asked if a lawsuit was likely to follow this action, Pollard said his group was looking at all available options.\n\nChesapeake Bay Foundation Virginia Staff Attorney Patrick Fanning said in a statement that Miyares' opinion misinterprets the law, which he said

Slated to take effect on January 1, 2025, this new regulation would have required 100% of new cars sold in Model Year 2035 to be electric vehicles.\n\nHowever, the tides have now turned. Attorney General Jason Miyares' official opinion has confirmed that Virginia is not legally bound to follow the California mandate, as the law, as written, does not require the Commonwealth to do so. This paves the way for Virginia to chart its own course, independent of the policies of a state nearly 3,000 miles away.\n\nThe implications of the California mandate were far-reaching and potentially detrimental to Virginia's automotive industry and consumers. Under the \"Advanced Clean Cars II\" regulation, beginning in Model Year 2026, 35% of new car sales would have been required to be electric vehicles, rising to 100% by 2035. Failure to comply could have resulted in auto manufacturers facing fines of up to $20,000 per vehicle sold.\n\nGiven that EVs only amounted to 9% of vehicles sold in Virginia in 2023, the application of these mandates could have led to hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties. This burden would have ultimately fallen on Virginia's auto consumers and dealers, leaving them with less money to invest in their businesses, pay staff, and offer competitive wages.\n\nRead: Florida Sens. Rubio And Scott Lead Effort To Block Biden's Agenda To \"Tear This Country Apart\"\n\nGovernor Youngkin's announcement marks a significant victory for the people of Virginia. \"The idea that government should tell people what kind of car they can or can't purchase is fundamentally wrong,\" he stated. \"Virginians deserve the freedom to choose which vehicles best fit the needs of their families and businesses.\"\n\nThis sentiment is echoed by Senator Ryan McDougle, who co-patroned legislation to repeal the California mandate during this year's legislative session. \"Virginia's laws should not be determined by California politicians,\" he asserted. \"Instead, our laws should be decided by Virginians who are elected to serve Virginia and address issues that face our Commonwealth, not a state nearly 3,000 miles away.\"\n\nWith the end of the California mandate, Virginia will now follow federal emissions standards, effective January 1, 2025. This decision aligns with the Commonwealth's commitment to empowering its citizens and ensuring that the automotive choices available to them are not dictated by distant, unelected officials.\n\nThe move away from the California mandate also opens the door for Virginia to explore innovative solutions that cater to the unique needs and preferences of its residents. By embracing a more localized approach, the state can tailor its policies to support the growth and development of its automotive industry, while also addressing the specific environmental and economic challenges faced by Virginians.\n\nRead: Florida Sen. Marco Rubio Calls On Biden To 'Cut Red Tape,' Prepare For 2024 Hurricane Season\n\nAs Virginia moves forward, the state's leaders recognize the importance of embracing technological advancements in the automotive industry. While the decision to abandon the California mandate does not diminish the Commonwealth's commitment to sustainability, it allows for a more balanced and nuanced approach to the adoption of electric vehicles.\n\nBy fostering an environment that encourages innovation and consumer choice, Virginia can pave the way for the seamless integration of EVs and other alternative fuel technologies into the transportation landscape. This approach not only empowers Virginians to make informed decisions about their vehicle purchases but also positions the state as a leader in the evolving automotive landscape.\n\nThe success of Virginia's decision to exit the California EV mandate will hinge on the state's ability to engage with a diverse range of stakeholders, including automakers, dealerships, environmental organizations, and consumer advocates. By fostering open dialogues and collaborative partnerships, Virginia can develop a comprehensive strategy that balances the needs of all parties involved.\n\nThis collaborative approach will be crucial in addressing concerns, identifying opportunities, and crafting policies that are both effective and responsive to the unique circumstances of the Commonwealth. By working together, Virginia can ensure that its automotive future is shaped by the voices and priorities of its citizens, rather than the dictates of a distant state.\n\nWhile the decision to exit the California EV mandate may raise concerns about the Commonwealth's commitment to environmental sustainability, Virginia's leaders have emphasized their dedication to addressing climate change and promoting clean energy solutions.\n\nYoungkin has made it clear that this move does not diminish the state's focus on sustainability. \"This decision is not about abandoning our commitment to the environment,\" he stated. \"It's about empowering Virginians to make choices that align with their needs and values, while also exploring innovative ways to reduce our environmental impact.\"\n\nBy adopting a more flexible and localized approach, Virginia can explore a range of strategies to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles and other clean transportation options. This could include incentives, infrastructure investments, and collaborative partnerships with the private sector and environmental stakeholders.", "source": {"uri": "tampafp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Free Press -

The law is clear, and I am proud to announce Virginians will no longer be forced to live under this out-of-touch policy.\"\n\nCalifornia first adopted its Advanced Clean Cars (ACC) standard in 2012. The rules required automakers to gradually increase sales of zero-emission vehicles as a percent of total sales in California, culminating in an 8-percent share in 2025. Plug-in hybrids, which use both electric and gas-powered motors, counted for partial credit toward the total.\n\nThe Virginia General Assembly passed House Bill 1965 in 2021, which directed the State Air Pollution Control Board to adopt low-emission and zero-emission vehicle standards equivalent to California's. The bill was signed into law by then-Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, whose support helped guarantee the bill's passage. Virginia is among 18 states and the District of Columbia that have adopted some or all of California's regulations.\n\nBut the following year, California adopted Advanced Clear Cars II, which greatly expanded the requirements of the original standard. Under the new rules, the zero-emission requirement would jump from 8 percent of automaker's sales for model year 2025 all the way to 35 percent in 2026, increasing each year until 100 percent of all new vehicles sold for model year 2035 must be electric.\n\nThe following day, Youngkin and the Republican-controlled Virginia House of Delegates indicated their intent to repeal H.B. 1965 and uncouple the state from California's rules, but the Democrat-controlled state Senate squashed their efforts the following year. In the 2023 elections, Democrats regained control of the House of Delegates while keeping control of the Senate, and the state Senate once again defeated efforts to repeal the law in January 2024.\n\nUltimately, California's more aggressive rules provided the legal justification for Virginia's withdrawal. Youngkin's press release claims that H.B. 1965 merely authorized the state to follow Advanced Clean Cars I, the rules in place at the time that went through 2025. \"An opinion from Attorney General Jason Miyares confirms the law, as written, does not require Virginia to follow ACC II,\" the press release continues. \"Therefore, the Commonwealth will follow federal emissions standards on January 1, 2025.\"\n\n\"We are alarmed that Governor Youngkin thinks that he is above the law,\" Nicole Vaughan, communications director for the Virginia Conservation Network, tells Reason in a statement. \"Legislation passed in 2021 directs Virginia's Air Pollution Control Board to adopt Advanced Clean Cars and subsequent updates to the program. In doing so, Virginia exercised an option under the federal Clean Air Act to follow the more stringent standards adopted by California and several other states to address tailpipe pollution.\"\n\n\"Virginia's legislature chose to adopt Clean Car Standards in order to increase consumers' access to electric vehicles, improve our air quality, and save lives,\" Wyatt Gordon, senior policy manager for land use and transportation at the Virginia Conservation Network, told Reason in a statement. \"To unilaterally pull our Commonwealth out of these shared standards is undemocratic, short-sighted, and wrong for Virginia.\"\n\nThe federal standards, released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in March, are less stringent than California's but still anticipate that by 2035, more than 70 percent of new vehicles sold in the U.S. would be all-electric or hybrids. Even this is a daunting prospect, as E.V.s currently account for only 6.5 percent of all vehicles sold in the U.S.", "source": {"uri": "reason.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reason"}, "authors":

The new CARB regulations are set to take effect on January 1st, 2025.\n\n\"EV mandates like California's are unworkable and out of touch with reality, and thankfully the law does not bind us to their regulations,\" said Miyares. \"California does not control which cars Virginians buy and any thoughts that automobile manufacturers should face millions of dollars in civil penalties rather than allowing our citizens to choose their own vehicles is completely absurd.\"\n\n\"Once again, Virginia is declaring independence -- this time from a misguided electric vehicle mandate imposed by unelected leaders nearly 3,000 miles away from the Commonwealth,\" said Youngkin in a statement. He went on to call such vehicle regulations, including laws dictating which kinds of cars people can buy, \"fundamentally wrong.\"\n\n\"He seems to think he has more power than Vladimir Putin,\" said Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell (D-Va.) following Youngkin's announcement. \"The governor is breaking the law and the AG is giving him cover.\"\n\nThe far-left Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) also issued a statement falsely calling Youngkin's decision \"illegal,\" as well as \"shortsighted and bad policy.\"\n\n\"The Clean Cars standards will help spur the transition to cleaner vehicles and bring significant health and environmental benefits to all Virginians,\" said Trip Pollard, an SELC attorney. \"That is why the General Assembly adopted them. The Governor tried to get the legislature to repeal the law and failed; he cannot just dictate a different outcome.\"\n\nFollowing Youngkin's decision, the state of Virginia will return to federal standards for carbon emissions at the end of 2024. Natural and Historic Resources Secretary Travis Voyles confirmed on Wednesday that, as per Miyares' declaration, state law in Virginia does not require the State Air Pollution Control Board to obey California's rules.\n\nYoungkin's decision is the latest attempt to overturn previous strict \"green\" laws enacted back when Virginia was under complete Democratic control. In 2021, a \"clean cars\" law was passed by the then-Democratic state legislature and signed into law by then-Governor Ralph Northam (D-Va.). The law demands that a certain percentage of vehicles sold in Virginia be either electric or hybrid, starting in 2024.

Glenn Youngkin announced Wednesday.\n\nThat's when California's current mandate is superseded by new California Air Resources Board targets.\n\nThe new California mandates step up the pace to require that all new car, truck and SUV sales be zero emission vehicles by 2035, with 35% of new sales being electric vehicles in model year 2026.\n\nAutomakers would be fined $20,000 for each non EV sold over those targets.\n\nYoungkin said an official opinion from Attorney General Jason Miyares says a 2021 Virginia law adopting the current California standard does not require accepting the new one.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency gave states the option of adopting its own standards or the stricter California ones. Virginia had opted for the California requirements.\n\nYoungkin noted that with EVs accounting for 9% of vehicles sold in Virginia last year, California-mandated fines would result in hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties that would be passed on to consumers.\n\n\"Once again, Virginia is declaring independence - this time from a misguided electric vehicle mandate imposed by unelected leaders nearly 3,000 miles away,\" Youngkin said.\n\n\"The idea that government should tell people what kind of car they can or can't purchase is fundamentally wrong,\" he said.\n\nMiyares' opinion letter says the language of the 2021 law in effect says Virginia may adopt the final California regulations, not that it must.\n\nThat means that the state is no longer legally bound to follow the California emission standards, he said.\n\n\"EV mandates like California's are unworkable and out of touch with reality, and thankfully the law does not bind us to their regulations,\" he said.\n\n\"California does not control which cars Virginians buy and any thoughts that automobile manufacturers should face millions of dollars in civil penalties rather than allowing our citizens to choose their own vehicles is completely absurd.\"\n\nEnvironmental groups criticize move\n\nMichael Town, Executive Director of the Virginia League of Conservation Voters, said the EV move, like Youngkin's decision to pull Virginia from the multi-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative to reduce carbon emission, ignores the dangers of climate change.\n\n\"Taking away one of our best tools to protect Virginians from power plant pollution wasn't enough,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"Now, Governor Youngkin wants Virginians to keep breathing tailpipe pollution too, despite laws on the books mandating the Commonwealth to tackle both of these major drivers of the climate crisis and detriments to public health.\"\n\nOther environmental groups were quick to respond,\n\n\"Governor Youngkin's attempt to wave his hand and dismiss Virginia's Clean Cars law is illegal, shortsighted, and bad public policy,\" said Trip Pollard, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center.\n\nConnor Kish, director of the Sierra Club Virginia Chapter, said the move \"is further proof that Governor Youngkin thinks he can sidestep the laws he doesn't like.\"\n\nAuto dealers back longer timeline\n\nBut Don Hall, president and chief executive office of the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association, said the new California standards can't be met in Virginia by 2035.\n\nWhile the association supported the 2021 law, seeing it as a way to encourage automakers to make the Virginia market a priority for EV shipments, \"The reality, however, is that consumer demand for EVs in Virginia and nationally has not yet materialized, compounded by costs, \"range anxiety,\" and the lack of charging and electrical infrastructure to support these new vehicles,\" Hall said.\n\n\"We continue to believe EV goals are achievable, but on a longer timeline,\" he said.\n\nLegislation to repeal the 2021 law died in this year's General Assembly.\n\nStates where it's easiest-and hardest-to charge an electric vehicle States where it's easiest-and hardest-to charge an electric vehicle Top 10 states for charging your electric vehicle EV demand is growing faster than infrastructure Charging infrastructure lags behind demand States where it's easiest-and hardest-to charge an electric vehicle\n\nDave Ress (804) 649-6948\n\ndress@timesdispatch.com\n\nDave Ress\n\nGrowth and Development Reporter\n\nAuthor twitter Author email Follow Dave Ress Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

Glenn Youngkin said that Virginia will be backing away from the emissions standards set by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), going for looser federal regulations instead once current regulations expire at the end of the year.\n\nThe Republican insisted that the choice was a matter of freedom for his residents, declaring \"independence\" for the commonwealth from pesky emissions officials outside Virginian borders.\n\n\"Once again, Virginia is declaring independence -- this time from a misguided electric vehicle mandate imposed by unelected leaders nearly 3,000 miles away from the Commonwealth,\" Youngkin said in a statement.\n\nThe commonwealth of Virginia adopted California's CARB standards under the leadership of Democrat Ralph Northam after its house of delegates and state senate approved the measure in 2021\n\nA total of 17 states, including Democrat-led states like New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts use California's emissions policies. But the agreement has a waiver that allows the state to create its own rules; CARB's rules are notorious for being held up to higher standards than the federal government's.\n\nThe central issue with the CARB standards is its guidelines regarding electric vehicles and the timeline for their full adoption. Under new rules that are set to take effect in 2025 called the Advanced Clean Cars II rules, California and other states adopting the CARB standards will effectively begin the incremental phasing out of cars with gas and diesel-powered engines. States under these rules will have 35% of new car sales in the state to be electric in model year 2026, all the way to 100% of new car sales being electric cars in 2035.\n\n\"The idea that government should tell people what kind of car they can or can't purchase is fundamentally wrong,\" the Republican said. \"Virginians deserve the freedom to choose which vehicles best fit the needs of their families and businesses. The law is clear, and I am proud to announce Virginians will no longer be forced to live under this out-of-touch policy.\n\nThe governor and other Republican Virginia state lawmakers have been opposed to the policy, and have tried to back away from the CARB measure using conventional means in the Democrat-majority legislature. In a statement to conservative news outlet The Daily Caller in September 2023, a spokesperson for the governor said that the policy developed in California does not match what Virginians want, noting that \"California's requirements for their citizens should not be a one size fits all solution for Virginia.\"\n\nGov. Youngkin justified his decision by citing Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, a Republican who stated in a legal opinion that the state is not legally obligated to abide by the CARB rules in question. Additionally, the governor justified that the low sales of EVs in the state did not warrant such a change, which could cause dire consequences for auto dealers.\n\n\"Given that EVs only amounted to 9% of vehicles sold in Virginia in 2023, application of the misguided mandates could have resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties,\" Youngkin's office said in a statement. \"Virginia auto consumers and dealers could be forced to bear these costs. Not only would this leave auto dealers with less money to pay staff, offer raises, and grow their businesses, it could force many small auto dealers to permanently close their doors.\"\n\nMore Business of EVs:\n\nRelated: Fisker employees revealed some sketchy practices it used to fix its novel EV\n\nElectrical resistance:\n\nIn March 2024, Gov. Youngkin endorsed the former President Donald J. Trump in the upcoming presidential election. Like Youngkin, EVs have been a pressing issue for the Donald, who has vowed to reverse, eliminate or make President Biden's climate plans disappear.\n\nIn May 2024 report by the Washington Post, the former president hosted some of the country's top oil executives at his Mar-a-Lago residence. According to those familiar with the matter, the former president implored the figureheads to raise $1 billion for his presidential campaign at a dinner, vowing to immediately reverse Biden's environmental rules and policies and block new ones once in the Oval Office.\n\nSpecifically, Trump mischaracterized the EPA's newly implemented looser EV rules as \"Biden's mandate,\" calling the rules \"ridiculous.\"\n\nUnder the final rulings set by the Environmental Protection Agency, the auto industry must sell at least 56% EVs within the total number of all new auto sales by 2032. Additionally, the new rules require the industry to have plug-in hybrids and other partially electric cars account for 13% of new car sales, while more fuel-efficient gas powered cars should account for a even larger chunk of new auto sales figures.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024", "source": {"uri": "star-telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fort Worth

Glenn Youngkin (R) said Wednesday that he will withdraw the state from participation in California's tough auto emissions standards at the end of this year, using an opinion from Virginia Attorney General Jason S. Miyares (R) as justification for undoing an action taken by the General Assembly.\n\n\"Once again, Virginia is declaring independence - this time from a misguided electric vehicle mandate imposed by unelected leaders nearly 3,000 miles away from the Commonwealth,\" Youngkin said in a news release.\n\nDemocrats accused him of overstepping his authority. \"The governor seems to think we live in a dictatorship where only he decides what the law is,\" state Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell (D-Fairfax) said via text message, calling the action \"destructive of Virginia's pro-business reputation.\"\n\nThis marks at least the second time Youngkin has circumvented environmental standards passed by Democratic majorities in the legislature. Last year, he ordered the state Air Pollution Control Board to exit the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, a multistate compact in which energy producers trade carbon emissions credits.\n\nThat move is the subject of a lawsuit filed by the Southern Environmental Law Center on behalf of an environmental group, arguing that the governor has no power to undo a law passed by the legislature.\n\nCalifornia standards require zero-emission vehicles to make up at least 22 percent of new vehicle sales by the end of next year or manufacturers must pay a penalty. Those standards are set to get even stricter, requiring all new vehicle sales to be zero-emission by 2035. Federal standards, by contrast, do not require phasing out sales of gas-powered vehicles and envision a slower transition to electric vehicles or other alternatives.\n\nThe California auto emissions standards were part of a package of environmental laws adopted by the Virginia General Assembly in 2021, when Democrats controlled both the Senate and House of Delegates. Under federal law, states must comply with auto emissions standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency, but California is allowed to adopt stricter standards and states may choose to adhere to those instead.\n\nSeventeen states and the District of Columbia have adopted California standards, and automakers often build to those specifications because adherents represent a major part of the vehicle market.\n\nYoungkin has routinely blasted Virginia's participation, saying the state should not let another government set its standards. Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle (R-Hanover) joined the governor in asking Miyares for an opinion on whether the General Assembly's action required the state to participate, and Miyares found this week that the legislation did not create a mandate.\n\nThe law says state regulators \"may\" participate in California standards, Miyares wrote. \"The General Assembly knows how to express its intention and easily could have directed the Board to adopt standards identical to California's,\" he wrote.\n\nIn addition, Miyares noted that California's air board recently adopted a new, even stricter version of the emissions standards, set to take effect next year. Because the Virginia Air Pollution Control Board adopted California standards that expire at the end of 2024, he said, the board would have to act again to adopt the new regime.\n\nVirginia Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources Travis A. Voyle sent a letter this week to the air board informing its members that there will be no such action. \"Therefore, beginning in calendar year 2025, [the new California standards] will not be applicable in Virginia and car manufacturers will be free to sell new vehicles under current federal regulations,\" Voyles wrote.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The law is clear, and I am proud to announce Virginians will no longer be forced to live under this out-of-touch policy.\"\n\nCalifornia first adopted its Advanced Clean Cars (ACC) standard in 2012. The rules required automakers to gradually increase sales of zero-emission vehicles as a percent of total sales in California, culminating in an 8-percent share in 2025. Plug-in hybrids, which use both electric and gas-powered motors, counted for partial credit toward the total.\n\nThe Virginia General Assembly passed House Bill 1965 in 2021, which directed the State Air Pollution Control Board to adopt low-emission and zero-emission vehicle standards equivalent to California's. The bill was signed into law by then-Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, whose support helped guarantee the bill's passage. Virginia is among 18 states and the District of Columbia that have adopted some or all of California's regulations.\n\nBut the following year, California adopted Advanced Clear Cars II, which greatly expanded the requirements of the original standard. Under the new rules, the zero-emission requirement would jump from 8 percent of automaker's sales for model year 2025 all the way to 35 percent in 2026, increasing each year until 100 percent of all new vehicles sold for model year 2035 must be electric.\n\nThe following day, Youngkin and the Republican-controlled Virginia House of Delegates indicated their intent to repeal H.B. 1965 and uncouple the state from California's rules, but the Democrat-controlled state Senate squashed their efforts the following year. In the 2023 elections, Democrats regained control of the House of Delegates while keeping control of the Senate, and the state Senate once again defeated efforts to repeal the law in January 2024.\n\nUltimately, California's more aggressive rules provided the legal justification for Virginia's withdrawal. Youngkin's press release claims that H.B. 1965 merely authorized the state to follow Advanced Clean Cars I, the rules in place at the time that went through 2025. \"An opinion from Attorney General Jason Miyares confirms the law, as written, does not require Virginia to follow ACC II,\" the press release continues. \"Therefore, the Commonwealth will follow federal emissions standards on January 1, 2025.\"\n\n\"We are alarmed that Governor Youngkin thinks that he is above the law,\" Nicole Vaughan, communications director for the Virginia Conservation Network, tells Reason in a statement. \"Legislation passed in 2021 directs Virginia's Air Pollution Control Board to adopt Advanced Clean Cars and subsequent updates to the program. In doing so, Virginia exercised an option under the federal Clean Air Act to follow the more stringent standards adopted by California and several other states to address tailpipe pollution.\"\n\n\"Virginia's legislature chose to adopt Clean Car Standards in order to increase consumers' access to electric vehicles, improve our air quality, and save lives,\" Wyatt Gordon, senior policy manager for land use and transportation at the Virginia Conservation Network, told Reason in a statement. \"To unilaterally pull our Commonwealth out of these shared standards is undemocratic, short-sighted, and wrong for Virginia.\"\n\nThe federal standards, released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in March, are less stringent than California's but still anticipate that by 2035, more than 70 percent of new vehicles sold in the U.S. would be all-electric or hybrids. Even this is a daunting prospect, as E.V.s currently account for only 6.5 percent of all vehicles sold in the U.S.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors":

Miyares says the opinion confirms that Virginians are no longer required to follow California's standards. Virginia's \"clean cars\" law was initially adopted in 2021, when the state government was under full Democratic control.

Glenn Youngkin said that Virginia will be backing away from the emissions standards set by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), going for looser federal regulations instead once current regulations expire at the end of the year.\n\nThe Republican insisted that the choice was a matter of freedom for his residents, declaring \"independence\" for the commonwealth from pesky emissions officials outside Virginian borders.\n\n\"Once again, Virginia is declaring independence -- this time from a misguided electric vehicle mandate imposed by unelected leaders nearly 3,000 miles away from the Commonwealth,\" Youngkin said in a statement.\n\nThe commonwealth of Virginia adopted California's CARB standards under the leadership of Democrat Ralph Northam after its house of delegates and state senate approved the measure in 2021\n\nA total of 17 states, including Democrat-led states like New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts use California's emissions policies. But the agreement has a waiver that allows the state to create its own rules; CARB's rules are notorious for being held up to higher standards than the federal government's.\n\nThe central issue with the CARB standards is its guidelines regarding electric vehicles and the timeline for their full adoption. Under new rules that are set to take effect in 2025 called the Advanced Clean Cars II rules, California and other states adopting the CARB standards will effectively begin the incremental phasing out of cars with gas and diesel-powered engines. States under these rules will have 35% of new car sales in the state to be electric in model year 2026, all the way to 100% of new car sales being electric cars in 2035.\n\n\"The idea that government should tell people what kind of car they can or can't purchase is fundamentally wrong,\" the Republican said. \"Virginians deserve the freedom to choose which vehicles best fit the needs of their families and businesses. The law is clear, and I am proud to announce Virginians will no longer be forced to live under this out-of-touch policy.\n\nThe governor and other Republican Virginia state lawmakers have been opposed to the policy, and have tried to back away from the CARB measure using conventional means in the Democrat-majority legislature. In a statement to conservative news outlet The Daily Caller in September 2023, a spokesperson for the governor said that the policy developed in California does not match what Virginians want, noting that \"California's requirements for their citizens should not be a one size fits all solution for Virginia.\"\n\nGov. Youngkin justified his decision by citing Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, a Republican who stated in a legal opinion that the state is not legally obligated to abide by the CARB rules in question. Additionally, the governor justified that the low sales of EVs in the state did not warrant such a change, which could cause dire consequences for auto dealers.\n\n\"Given that EVs only amounted to 9% of vehicles sold in Virginia in 2023, application of the misguided mandates could have resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties,\" Youngkin's office said in a statement. \"Virginia auto consumers and dealers could be forced to bear these costs. Not only would this leave auto dealers with less money to pay staff, offer raises, and grow their businesses, it could force many small auto dealers to permanently close their doors.\"\n\nMore Business of EVs:\n\nNew study suggests EVs are supercharging an impending environmental crisisGM President has bold plans for an iconic sports car's EV resurrectionFord CEO says this iconic model will \"never\" be an EV\n\nRelated: Fisker employees revealed some sketchy practices it used to fix its novel EV\n\nElectrical resistance:\n\nIn March 2024, Gov. Youngkin endorsed the former President Donald J. Trump in the upcoming presidential election. Like Youngkin, EVs have been a pressing issue for the Donald, who has vowed to reverse, eliminate or make President Biden's climate plans disappear.\n\nIn May 2024 report by the Washington Post, the former president hosted some of the country's top oil executives at his Mar-a-Lago residence. According to those familiar with the matter, the former president implored the figureheads to raise $1 billion for his presidential campaign at a dinner, vowing to immediately reverse Biden's environmental rules and policies and block new ones once in the Oval Office.\n\nSpecifically, Trump mischaracterized the EPA's newly implemented looser EV rules as \"Biden's mandate,\" calling the rules \"ridiculous.\"\n\nUnder the final rulings set by the Environmental Protection Agency, the auto industry must sell at least 56% EVs within the total number of all new auto sales by 2032. Additionally, the new rules require the industry to have plug-in hybrids and other partially electric cars account for 13% of new car sales, while more fuel-efficient gas powered cars should account for a even larger chunk of new auto sales figures.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and

The reason for this is because California had clean air regulations before the federal government did, so as long as its regulations exceed the national regulations, it's given a waiver so it can set its own.\n\nIn 2022, California finalized a relatively conservative goal targeting 80%+ all-electric car sales by 2035 (the regulation will allow up to 20% PHEVs), called \"Advanced Clean Cars II\" (ACC2). The regulation was intentionally made softer than what California itself could achieve, such that other states that aren't as far ahead on EV adoption as California is would still be able to adopt it.\n\nThe reason for this is because other states are allowed to follow those regulations instead of the federal ones, as long as they adopt the regulations fully.\n\nAs a result, there are currently several so-called \"CARB states,\" or section 177 states, which adopt California's clean car regulations.\n\nVirginia is one of these states, although the state's republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, said today that he intends to ensure that the state's clean air regulations will lapse by the end of this year, despite Virginia law stating otherwise.\n\nStrangely, as part of his politically-charged and immaturely-written release announcing this decision, Youngkin saw it fit to include an opinion of the Virginia Attorney General stating that he is allowed to make this unilateral decision attacking Virginians' rights to breathe clean air.\n\nWhy did he have to include this? Because, despite his claim about CARB being \"unelected,\" the elected Virginia state legislature did indeed pass a law in 2021 making Virginia a CARB state. And the very same Attorney General confirmed in 2022 that Virginia law would adopt California's regulations. Republicans in VA legislature tried to pass a law to poison Virginians with higher auto emissions, but failed to do so. As a result, Virginia still remains a CARB state, and the US Department of Energy confirms that Virginia adopted the ACC2 regulation in January.\n\nSo, despite Virginia law not changing since then, the state's republican attorney general seems to think something is different now. We wonder if an upcoming election, where a reality TV host has told oil companies he'll take $1 billion in bribes in his attempt to turn dirty air into part of his ignorant culture war, might have something to do with that. Either way, Youngkin's effort today will surely waste plenty of time and taxpayer money in court.\n\nBeyond the flip-flopping of the VA attorney general, Youngkin's release contains other false statements. For example, he claims that he seeks to torpedo the law in order to help Virginia's auto dealers, but in fact the Virginia Auto Dealer Association was supportive of VA's 2021 law and of California's ACC2 regulation. It decries that these regulations are being decided \"3,000 miles away,\" when they were in fact voted on by Virginia's legislature itself (which is actually 0.2 miles away from the Governor's Office - here's walking directions for you, Glenn).\n\nHe also claims that EVs will cost the state more money, which is simply wrong. Each EV brings an average of $10,000 in health savings. This is why these sorts of regulations save states money - California will save $13 billion from ACC2, and the US will save $100 billion per year from new EPA regulations. As a result, the International Council on Clean Transportation says Virginia will save $814 million in yearly health costs by adopting ACC2 and potentially $30 billion in long-term health benefits from widespread EV adoption. Not to mention tax credit availability, fuel and maintenance savings, and really cheap deals on EVs right now.\n\nSo - Youngkin wants to do something that is objectively bad and costly for his state and that his own attorney general acknowledged violates the law. And seems to think, by the way the release was written, that this will score him political points.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Youngkin's illegal announcement received a negative response from environmental and consumer groups, like Sierra Club, Chesapeake Climate Action Network, VA League of Conservation Voters (which pointed out that Youngkin also illegally left a regional effort to reduce power plant emissions), and business assocation Advanced Energy United.\n\nMeanwhile, electric cars are already making California healthier - benefits that Virginia could have in the future, if not for its republican governor trying to score political points by forcing poison on his populace (and the absurdity of the situation we're in - that anyone would consider that a political point-scorer - should not go unnoticed).", "source": {"uri": "electrek.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Electrek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jameson_dow@electrek.co", "name": "Jameson Dow", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Youngkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Youngkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Air_Resources_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California Air Resources Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobahn_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Autobahn Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Air_Act_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clean Air Act (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_Virginia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of Virginia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Culture war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virginia General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Adoption", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Adoption", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/State_Capitol_of_the_Commonwealth_of_Virginia_7358972234-e1717623429899.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627271", "eventUri": "eng-9627271", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Glenn Youngkin joined WTOP to discuss his decision to lift strict auto emission standards by the end of the year and also provided an update on damage from a round of severe storms in Northern Virginia.\n\nIn a potential blow to the push to get more people to buy electric cars, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin says the Commonwealth's strict auto emission standards -- based on California legislation -- will be lifted by the end of the year.\n\nThe governor says Virginians deserve to choose which vehicles fit their needs and the idea of the government telling people what kind of car they can buy is, in his words \"fundamentally wrong.\"\n\nYoungkin joined WTOP to discuss his decision on the emissions standards and also provided an update on damage from a round of severe storms in Northern Virginia.\n\nListen to the full interview below.\n\nThe transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nJohn Aaron: Governor, great to talk to you this morning. If I could just jump right in here, the question that a lot of people are asking is what specifically gives you the authority to make this move?\n\nGov. Glenn Youngkin: Well, first of all, good morning, and thank you for having me. And before we talk about anything, I want to thank our veterans and military today on the 80th commemoration of D-Day and what true heroism is all about. So to all of our vets and all of our military heroes: Thank you\n\nWith regards to our transition from being held to the California standards to being held to the national standards, the California original standards will sunset at the end of this year, Dec. 31, 2024. And we are choosing to, in fact, be held to the national standards, as opposed to the California standards. And it really gets back to three key reasons. Number one, the California standards mandate what kind of car you buy. And in fact, Virginians should be able to decide what car they buy. (The standards) would, in fact, increase the mandated percentage of car purchases to 35% EVs in 2026. And let's just be clear, this past year 9% of the cars that were purchased in Virginia were electric vehicles.\n\nIt's misguided and unrealistic to mandate. It will drive costs, which is the second big topic, which is Virginians should not be forced to incur a substantial penalty, because they want to exercise their freedom to decide what car they buy. And in fact, the penalties are huge. It's estimated that it would cost Virginians $1.2 billion in order to buy these mandated number of cars. And on top of that, if they didn't, then there's $1.8 billion dollars of penalties that could be imposed on them.\n\nAnd then finally -- and this is really important -- these are decisions that Virginians should make. And what happened in 2021 is our General Assembly and the former governor surrendered the right to make decisions for Virginians to an unelected body in California. And so the reality, of course, here is that we are reestablishing the role that Virginia's government should play, serving Virginians. We're reestablishing Virginians' rights to decide what kind of car they drive. And finally, we're recognizing the economic penalty that was so unfairly placed on Virginians.\n\nNow, let me just make one last comment. We will be subject to the federal standards. The federal standards that have come out are incredibly aggressive to reduce emissions. It's going to be done on a fleet-wide basis. And therefore, innovation that has been the hallmark of the American automotive industry will continue to drive reduction in emissions.\n\nPeople will have the ability to buy an electric vehicle. This is not an attack on electric vehicles. It's just a recognition that Virginians need to decide what they want to drive. If you want to buy electric vehicle, please buy one. If you want to buy a hybrid, please buy one. If you want to buy an internal combustion gas engine, please buy one. You'll see that fuel economy is increasing substantially. And therefore the overall federal standards will be what Virginia will be required to adhere to, and I think this is great for the Commonwealth.\n\nJohn Aaron: You make many good points. But Democrats say you're overreaching and can't undo state law here.\n\nGov. Glenn Youngkin: Well, that's just wrong. And the attorney general's opinion is extremely clear that the ACC I standards, which are the California standards that we have been subjected to, sunset at the end of the year. It's very clear in code -- the law is the law -- that in fact their air board may choose to adhere to federal standards or California standards. And we're gonna allow the ACC I standards and California to sunset. And going forward, we will be subjected to the federal standards. It's very clear. There's no question here. And I'm sorry that it doesn't fit their narrative, but the attorney general's opinion is incredibly clear. That's the law.\n\nMichelle Basch: And governor, briefly, before we let you go. Can you speak to any storm damage that you're hearing about after yesterday's apparent twisters?\n\nGov. Glenn Youngkin: So the short answer is the emergency management team is responding quickly. There's been some power outages. I'm always incredibly proud of the immediate work that our Virginia statewide emergency management team does in coordination with utilities particularly. And we're gathering all that information and will be able to report back a comprehensive view. But, first and foremost, we're rushing to the support of those that might have incurred some damage and on top of that lost power. The utilities are responding very quickly. And we've just lift everybody up this morning in prayer to make sure that everybody is OK ... The response has been coordinated. And I'll get a full brief later this morning once all the data is in.\n\nGet breaking news and daily headlines delivered to your email inbox by signing up here.\n\n\u00a9 2024 WTOP.

Glenn Youngkin said Wednesday that the state will no longer follow car emissions standards set by California, despite his party's failure to repeal or roll back a 2021 Democratic law that tied Virginia to those regulations.\n\nThe move tees up what could be another legal fight over Republican leaders' efforts to undo climate change-related measures Democrats passed when they had full control of state government a few years ago.\n\nThe governor has already drawn a lawsuit over his decision to end Virginia's participation in a regional program meant to curb carbon emissions from power plants, arguing the initiative was too burdensome for regular Virginians who had to absorb the cost through higher electricity bills.\n\nYoungkin has taken a similar line of attack against California's car emissions rules, which aim to slow climate change and reduce pollution by requiring the automotive industry to shift to selling more electric vehicles. The California standards require 100% of new cars sold to be electric vehicles starting in 2035, meaning the sale of new gas-powered vehicles would gradually be banned over the next decade.\n\n{snip}\n\nGRAHAM MOOMAW\n\n[email protected]\n\nhttps://x.com/gmoomaw\n\nA veteran Virginia politics reporter, Graham grew up in Hillsville and Lynchburg, graduating from James Madison University and earning a master's degree in journalism from the University of Maryland.

Attorney General Jason Miyares and Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced on June 5 that, starting next year, the state will comply with federal standards.\n\n\"EV mandates like California's are unworkable and out of touch with reality, and thankfully the law does not bind us to their regulations,\" said Miyares.\n\nThe previous Virginia governor, Democrat Ralph Northam, signed a bill in 2021 to embrace the automobile standards of the California Air Resource Board.\n\nThese 2021 standards would have forced auto dealers to sell a certain share of battery-powered cars in 2025, or face penalties. But California's new Advanced Clean Car II standards, passed in 2022, require 35% of new passenger cars, trucks and SUVs sold in the Golden State to be electric or hydrogen-fueled by 2026, and 100% by 2035 - far stricter than the bill signed by Northam, as Miyares notes in his opinion.\n\nVirginia was one of 16 states and the District of Columbia that signed on to California's 2021 standards. Returning to the federal standard is not only in the best interests of the commonwealth of Virginia, but also in the best interests of the United States. Virginia is the first to abandon California's new regulations and may start a tidal wave as others leave too.\n\nThe commonwealth's economy depends on reliable, affordable transportation for people and businesses. Farmers can't use electric tractors. Small businesses rely on gasoline-powered pickup trucks. Construction workers need inexpensive cars to get to sites far from mass transit.\n\nRegulations requiring EV sales are highly unpopular, and Youngkin's opponents will lose by challenging him.\n\nCalifornia's auto regulations aim to reduce total global carbon emissions, of which America's share is 13%, but these rules may not succeed. A battery-only electric vehicle has no tailpipe emissions, but emissions are generated from making the electricity, as well as from producing batteries, mining battery ingredients such as lithium, shipping batteries from China and disposing of spent batteries.\n\nEven if America were to stop using all fossil fuels today, worldwide temperatures would only be two-tenths of one degree cooler by 2100, according to government models.\n\n2. Owning an EV is convenient for drivers who can charge them at home overnight and who don't travel out of range. For others, stopping for an hour to recharge during the day while out on business, or while on a vacation trip, is a major drawback.\n\n3. EVs are smaller, and it's hard to fit three car seats in the back row. Plus, with kids, who wants to have to stop to recharge?\n\n4. EVs lose 40% of their battery range when the temperature dips below 20 degrees Fahrenheit and when the heating is on. That's why Wyoming has only 840 registered EVs, North Dakota has 640 and Alaska has 1,970.\n\nIn addition, China makes 80% of the world's electric batteries and controls 60% of the world's critical minerals that are used to make the batteries. Required use of EVs, rather than U.S. oil and natural gas resources, makes America depend on China. Youngkin wisely rejected the Ford partnership with Chinese battery giant CATL in 2023.\n\nApple has withdrawn from developing an EV. Ford lost $100,000 per EV sold in the first quarter of this year and announced a pause in its delivery of the new F-150 Lightning, citing quality-control problems. Mercedes no longer plans to go all electric by 2030. General Motors has abandoned its goal of selling 400,000 EVs by June 2024.\n\nDealers' lots are overflowing with unsold EVs. More than 4,500 auto dealers wrote to President Joe Biden asking him to delay the Environmental Protection Agency's mandate that 70% of new cars sold must be electric by 2032.\n\nCompulsory EVs increase poverty. With cars more expensive, people either have no car, or are forced into less reliable used cars, with a smaller choice of jobs or schools.\n\nAs long as people have a choice, they won't buy EVs in numbers that California regulations are requiring. Fortunately, Virginia is taking a smarter route.\n\n____\n\nDiana Furchtgott-Roth, former deputy assistant secretary for research and technology at the U.S. Department of Transportation, directs the

But California's new Advanced Clean Car II standards, passed in 2022, require 35% of new passenger cars, trucks and SUVs sold in the Golden State to be electric or hydrogen-fueled by 2036, and 100% by 2035 -- far stricter than the bill signed by Northam, as Miyares notes in his opinion.\n\nVirginia was one of 16 states and the District of Columbia that signed on to California's 2021 standards. Returning to the federal standard is not only in the best interests of the commonwealth of Virginia, but also in the best interests of the United States. Virginia is the first to abandon California's new regulations and may start a tidal wave as others leave too.\n\nThe commonwealth's economy depends on reliable, affordable transportation for people and businesses. Farmers can't use electric tractors. Small businesses rely on gasoline-powered pickup trucks. Construction workers need inexpensive cars to get to sites far from mass transit.\n\nRegulations requiring EV sales are highly unpopular, and Youngkin's opponents will lose by challenging him.\n\nCalifornia's auto regulations aim to reduce total global carbon emissions, of which America's share is 13%, but these rules may not succeed. A battery-only electric vehicle has no tailpipe emissions, but emissions are generated from making the electricity, as well as from producing batteries, mining battery ingredients such as lithium, shipping batteries from China and disposing of spent batteries.\n\nEven if America were to stop using all fossil fuels today, worldwide temperatures would only be two-tenths of one degree cooler by 2100, according to government models.\n\nPeople aren't choosing EVs for four reasons.\n\n1. EVs cost more than equivalent gasoline-powered vehicles. The Ford Lightning, the electric version of the Ford 150 pickup truck, one of America's top selling vehicles, costs an additional $17,000. Tesla's prices begin at $42,000 for a Model 3, and reach $100,000 for a Model X.\n\n2. Owning an EV is convenient for drivers who can charge them at home overnight and who don't travel out of range. For others, stopping for an hour to recharge during the day while out on business, or while on a vacation trip, is a major drawback.\n\n3. EVs are smaller, and it's hard to fit three car seats in the back row. Plus, with kids, who wants to have to stop to recharge?\n\n4. EVs lose 40% of their battery range when the temperature dips below 20 degrees Fahrenheit and when the heating is on. That's why Wyoming has only 840 registered EVs, North Dakota has 640 and Alaska has 1,970.\n\nIn addition, China makes 80% of the world's electric batteries and controls 60% of the world's critical minerals that are used to make the batteries. Required use of EVs, rather than U.S. oil and natural gas resources, makes America depend on China. Youngkin wisely rejected the Ford partnership with Chinese battery giant CATL in 2023.\n\nApple has withdrawn from developing an EV. Ford lost $100,000 per EV sold in the first quarter of this year and announced a pause in its delivery of the new F-150 Lightning, citing quality-control problems. Mercedes no longer plans to go all electric by 2030. General Motors has abandoned its goal of selling 400,000 EVs by June 2024.\n\nDealers' lots are overflowing with unsold EVs. More than 4,500 auto dealers wrote to President Joe Biden asking him to delay the Environmental Protection Agency's mandate that 70% of new cars sold must be electric by 2032.\n\nCompulsory EVs increase poverty. With cars more expensive, people either have no car, or are forced into less reliable used cars, with a smaller choice of jobs or schools.\n\nAs long as people have a choice, they won't buy EVs in numbers that California regulations are requiring. Fortunately, Virginia is taking a smarter route.\n\n____\n\nDiana Furchtgott-Roth, former deputy assistant secretary for research and technology at the U.S. Department of Transportation, directs the

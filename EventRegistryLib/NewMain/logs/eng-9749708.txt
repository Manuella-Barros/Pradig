And their daughter Sterling was the one to unveil the big news!\n\nOn July 19, in a joint-Instagram video post, both Brittany and Patrick shared their announcement of what baby number three will be: a boy or a girl. They shared the video with the caption reading, \"Baby Mahomes #3 is a....\ud83d\udc99\ud83e\ude77.\"\n\nYou can see the video HERE!\n\nIn the video, we see the Mahomes family gathering around a tic-tac-toe-inspired board that'll reveal the sex of baby number three. But instead of Brittany or Patrick unveiling the news, they got their sweet, expressive daughter Sterling to do so!\n\nWe see Sterling turn over the blocks, eventually revealing that the family is expecting another girl. Then, after the news was unveiled, both pink smoke and pink confetti exploded onto the scene. Then, we see the family of four smiling and playing together, showing such a sweet moment no one will forget.\n\nThis is also unlike their last reveal, which was surrounded by both friends and family. So it's also super-sweet to see this this intimate moment with the family!\n\nFor those who don't know, Brittany and Patrick have been together since high school and married on March 12, 2022. They have two children together named Sterling Skye, born in Feb 2021, and Patrick \"Bronze\" Lavon, born in Nov 2022.\n\nThen, on July 12, the family of four announced they were becoming a family of five! They shared a video of the family, announcing the news, on their Instagram with the caption reading, \"Round three, here we come \ud83e\udd0d\" You can see the video HERE!\n\nOn July 19, they revealed that they're expecting another baby girl for the Mahomes family!\n\nIn a previous interview with SheKnows, Brittany talked about how much she adores motherhood, and how she loves experiencing those first moments with her and Patrick's two kids.\n\n\"Oh my goodness, I love being a mom,\" she said. \"I think I've been called to be a mom ever since I was little. Just seeing my kids grow up, and the things that they're learning, and the things that they're taking from their dad ... when we have first experiences with them, taking them somewhere, seeing them happy and lit up and in good spirits when we do stuff, is probably the biggest thing that I enjoy.\"", "source": {"uri": "sheknows.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheKnows"}, "authors": [{"uri": "delilah_gray@sheknows.com", "name": "Delilah Gray", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brittany"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brittany"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confetti", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Confetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Baby", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Baby", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large_Families", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large Families", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mahomes.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749708", "eventUri": "eng-9749708", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 255, "textEnd": 262, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 1476, "textEnd": 1483}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-03-", "textStart": 1333, "textEnd": 1341}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

In the video, Stirling was tasked with flipping around each block to reveal a \"Little Sis\" or \"Little Bro,\" represented by pink X's and blue O's. The game board was set up by their pool, underneath an arch of pink and blue balloons.\n\nIn the end, their eldest won Tic-Tac-Toe with a row of three pink X's, which means the Mahomes family is expecting another baby girl. But if you thought the old-school game was a cute replacement for colored smoke guns or confetti cannons, you'd be mistaken. Upon the reveal, both were utilized to cover the soon-to-be family of five in a cloud of pink smoke and confetti. You can see the entire reveal here.\n\nThis update comes a week after the power couple announced they were expecting their third child by posting another sweet family video on July 12. In that clip, each member of the Mahomes family danced around in white outfits while Stirling held on tight to ultrasound photos of her baby sister.

Clips showed the Kansas City Chiefs player helping Sterling turn the pieces to find out whether she was getting another sister or a brother.\n\nAs Sterling flipped the final piece on the top row, spurts of pink confetti dust shot out from behind the balloons over a line of three pink Xs on the board. Patrick, 28, and Brittany, 28, hugged their two infants and handed them flags that read, \"Big Sister\" and \"Big Brother.\"\n\nFans were thrilled to see the pair were expanding their family of four to add a second daughter. \"Baby girl is already so loved,\" a kind woman remarked, while another said: \"Woohoo! Congrats!!!!! Love y'all!!!\"\n\nThe extravagant gender reveal comes just a week after the news of Brittany's pregnancy was shared online. In a July 12 post on Instagram, Patrick and Brittany told their followers they were expecting again with a loving video.\n\n\"Round three, here we come,\" the duo wrote next to footage of their family running around holding ultra-sound pictures as \"Count on Me\" by Bruno Mars rang in the background.\n\nPatrick and Brittany's love story started in high school. The NFL quarterback and the soccer star bonded over their passion for sports while attending Whitehouse High School in Texas. Though Brittany was a junior and Patrick was a sophomore, romance sparks flew between them. They started dating, continuing their relationship through the end of their high school experience and into college.\n\nThe now-retired soccer player welcomed her firstborn with Patrick in 2021, a year before they said \"I do\" in Maui, Hawaii. Not long after their nuptials, baby Patrick was born.\n\nAhead of the Chiefs training camp, Patrick and Brittany spent time in London, watching day five of Wimbledon.

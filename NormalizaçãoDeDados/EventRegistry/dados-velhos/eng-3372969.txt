China had already been present in the region, predominantly aligned with the socialist regimes in Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina and Ecuador. Lately, however, this has changed with the economic breakdown in Venezuela and with the changes in attitudes towards China owing to centrist regimes in elsewhere in the region. The ever-increasing Chinese involvement in LAC prompted suggestions that it would soon fill the vacuum created with the withdrawal of the United States and engender further conflict between the two.\n\nHowever, a set of recent events in Latin America and more particularly in Central America tells a different story. In January, newly elected Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen undertook a visit to four Central American countries, namely Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. The visit included the signing of major trade and arms deals.\n\nIn June 2017, Panama shifted its diplomatic alignment from Taiwan to China. Two weeks later, the U.S. announced the Trump's administration's first arms deal with Taiwan, worth $1.42 billion. A month later, Taiwan announced visa-free entry on a reciprocal basis to Paraguay and a visa waiver to ten allied Central American and Caribbean countries.\n\nEnjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.\n\nThe aforementioned cases are not a set of incidents that are related to Taiwan alone, but directed in response to the Chinese presence as well. In 2016, with the election of highly nationalist candidate to the position of president in Taiwan, the long standing truce between China and Taiwan has been strained.\n\nAs the China-Taiwan rivalry continues, the U.S. plays a part. The boiling of tension was marked by the December 2 phone call between Trump and Tsai, which many analysts viewed as violating the status quo. In addition, Tsai's visit to LAC in January 2017 included transit stopovers in Houston and San Francisco, despite Beijing's pressure on Washington to block it.\n\nIn reality, the competition in Central America, as of now, is not between the United States and China, but between China and Taiwan.\n\nThis is quite evident from China approach to Taiwan's regional allies. China believes firmly in the One China principle, which discredits Taiwan's independence and sovereign status. The underlying story in LAC is Beijing's pushing of the One China principle more forcefully around Central America and the Caribbean, where Taiwan's allies are concentrated. Indeed, Taiwan also believes that there can only be One China -- though it's definition of which China that is differs from Beijing's assessment -- a position which in principle stands incompatible with the co-existence of diplomatic relations with both China and Taiwan at the same time.\n\nA group of ten Central American and Caribbean nations, plus Paraguay in South America, form a major chunk of the only 20 countries that presently recognize Taiwan. The conflict between Taiwan and China has indeed become more real as is evident from China's shifting focus from South America to Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nThe number of visits and trade exchanges from both the sides -- Taiwan and LAC -- have considerably increased. Notably, during Tsai's visit in January 2017 and the foreign minister of Taiwan's recent trip, the heads of almost all the Central American countries stood with Taiwan. Guatemalan president Jimmy Morales in January 2017 reiterated his country's commitment to ward Taiwan. Nicaragua endorsed the international position of Taiwan and its participation in international bodies.\n\nIn July 2017, the President of Paraguay Horacio Cartes visited Taipei, in return for the Tsai's visit last year. His visit, as the head of the only country in South America to have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, among many other reasons, invited attention for its significance.\n\nSome countries in LAC, despite having diplomatic relations with China, also recognize Taiwan. Some regional states finally switched over alignment, receiving Chinese aid while having diplomatic relations with Taiwan has become increasingly difficult. Erstwhile in the Taiwanese camp, Panama, was a perfect example. Tsai's first overseas visit was to Panama, a month after taking the presidential oath. That China managed to poach Panama within about a year is surprising.\n\nWho is next?\n\nNicaragua, Paraguay, and St. Lucia are believed to be the next in line, with all three seriously contemplating switching over their relations to Beijing.\n\nChina and Taiwan have been competing with each other in LAC region largely via \"checkbook diplomacy.\" Lately, Taiwan has understood, with recent incidents like the case of Panama and Sao Tome and Principe, that it cannot match China's spending. Taiwan has instead delved into infrastructure projects, in place of past practice when Taiwan offered hard cash. Recently, Guatemala made a request of $650 billion for the fourth stage of the construction of Jacob Arbenz highway leading to the Atlantic, which as per reports is still under consideration. The request seems likely to be turned down as it exceeds the approved budget of the foreign ministry. This has also led other states, like Belize, to rethink the amount of aid it received from Taiwan, given the asymmetry. Some have started rethinking their relations on Taiwan-China axis.\n\nMost of these exchanges or visits are categorically intended to bring about further closeness in relations. Off the record, the primary purpose of the visit is to keep Taiwan's allies together and prevent China from poaching them. Last month, Taiwanese Foreign Minister David Lee made a visit to the Dominican Republic and Belize. There were reports that three Caribbean nations, -- St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and St. Kitts and Nevis -- declined to host the foreign minister. Such reports were refuted by Taiwan. The foreign minister clarified that those three Caribbean countries were not part of the original itinerary. In the background, it is to be noted that the three nations in discussion have full diplomatic relations with Taiwan. Why those island nations were left off the itinerary remains unexplained, when at least an official visit has been made to other allies in the past year.\n\nWith all these changes, only time will tell whether Taiwan will lose all its allies in Latin American and the Caribbean to China.\n\nBinay Prasad is a Ph.D. Candidate in Latin American Studies Programme at School of International Studies,

It comes from referenced remarks that Lee drew from an interview with long-time Taiwan friend Stephen Yates.\n\nHowever, such referencing does not legitimize the remarks, and in this case, the analogy used does not fit. Perhaps Lee stretched Yates' remarks to make a point.\n\nExamine first the analogy and application. In the remarks, Yates is said to maintain that unlike the US founders, who were willing to defend their declared independence with \"their lives, their assets and their sacred honor,\" Taiwanese are not so willing.\n\nSuch is not the case; instead it is the analogy that limps.\n\nWhen the US founding fathers made their declaration of independence, they had been under the rule of England since the founding of the colonies. The colonies' major and continued complaint was that they were being taxed, but had no representation in the British parliament. Their cry, \"no taxation without representation\" presented a clear and simple reason why they, as men with rights and dignity, should risk all and declare national independence.\n\nHowever, Taiwan's situation is totally different. Taiwan already is an independent, mid-sized nation; it issues its own taxes and is not beholden in any way to China. Taiwan does not need to declare independence.\n\nThe more appropriate question that needs to be addressed is: What will it take for other countries and nations to openly admit to this reality? Pursue this thought.\n\nAs far as national sovereignty is concerned, Taiwan fits the four criteria of the Montevideo Convention. It has a permanent population; it has a defined territory; it has a government, which in this case is democratically elected by all eligible voters; and it has the capacity to enter relations with other nations and states.\n\nSome might point to the fact that Taiwan is not a member of the UN. How then can it enter relations with other nations and states?\n\nThat situation is fraught with irony and history since Taiwan as the Republic of China (ROC) was a founding member of the UN. To use the vernacular, it is not only ironic, but also \"complicated.\"\n\nThe irony is all the more telling as Taiwan has a population that is greater than nearly 75 percent of all the nations in the UN.\n\nIn GDP, whether nominal or purchasing power parity, Taiwan outranks nearly 90 percent of all nations in the UN.\n\nGoing further, while only 19 countries officially recognize Taiwan as a nation, the ROC passport is given visa-free or visa-on-arrival acceptance in 134 countries. This calculates into Taiwan surpassing 80 percent of nations in the world in possessing travel freedom, and yet Taiwan is not an official member of the UN. Why?\n\nOne searches for an appropriate analogy or metaphor to explain Taiwan's complex situation. It is a hegemonic China that continually tries to keep Taiwan out of world organizations and to restrict the travel and freedom of its citizens.\n\nThe burden of explanation instead is on the other nations of the world who want to have their cake and eat it; or, to put it another way, they want their trade and interactions with China as well as Taiwan, and so they resort to agree upon deceptions.\n\nOne analogy used by some is to refer to China as the aging wife -- the da taitai (\u5927\u592a\u592a) -- who tries to insist that her husband does not recognize the more attractive and approachable Taiwan, seen as a xiao taitai (\u5c0f\u592a\u592a) or mistress. These other nations, playing the role of the husband, pretend to go along with this agreement, but secretly find their own ways and means to always meet Taiwan.", "dateTime": "2017-08-16T16:41:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 150, "textStart": 144, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-06", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.7137255072593689, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3372969", "time": "16:41:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3372969", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "47", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "228", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "287832", "label": {"eng": "Taipei"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Taipei"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "303396", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "score": 4}, {"id": "304024", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "score": 2}, {"id": "311680", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "score": 3}, {"id": "325106", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Purchasing power parity"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity", "score": 2}, {"id": "543385", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "China and the United Nations"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_and_the_United_Nations", "score": 2}, {"id": "545860", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "No taxation without representation"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_taxation_without_representation", "score": 3}, {"id": "707427", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Names of China"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_China", "score": 1}, {"id": "1019254", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Montevideo Convention"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montevideo_Convention", "score": 2}], "image": "http://www.taipeitimes.com/images/logo.gif", "timeCrawl": "16:41:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Taiwan already enjoys independence - Taipei Times", "originalArticle": null}

Meanwhile, Taiwan is being threatened by Chinese fighter jets, which have in recent weeks and months made repeated flights off the nation's east coast.\n\nBoth stories have been presented in a similar fashion: Pyongyang threatens Guam with a possible attack; Beijing threatens Taiwan with invasion. The underlying message is that the people of Taiwan and Guam are brothers in arms, under siege by aggressor nations.\n\nMany in Taiwan have until now failed to notice that the nation in fact has many geographical, cultural and historical ties with Guam. After all, the two have been closely linked to one another for a long time.\n\nTaiwanese should therefore pay closer attention to Guam, and place a greater value on the ties that connect the two.\n\nFirst, geography. Taiwan and Guam are both island nations in the western Pacific Ocean. As the Summer Universiade's English-language promotional material declares: \"Chinese Taipei [sic] is long and narrow\" -- so too is the island of Guam. Furthermore, the northern part of each island inclines eastward, as if both islands wish to keep their distance from China.\n\nSecond, culture. The Aborigines of Taiwan and Guam share a common ancestry; their clothing, ornaments and dances are remarkably similar. This is because they are Austronesians who did not begin to mix with foreign migrants until the 17th century.\n\nThird, history. The first sovereign country to rule Guam was Spain. The island was ceded to the US at the end of the Spanish-American War as an unincorporated US territory.\n\nThe first sovereign nation to rule Taiwan was also a Western country: The Netherlands. In 1662, Ming Dynasty general Cheng Cheng-kung (\u912d\u6210\u529f), also known as Koxinga, defeated the Dutch.\n\nThen, in 1683 Taiwan was annexed by the Qing Dynasty and became a colony of China. Following the Qing Dynasty's capitulation to Japan in the First Sino-Japanese War, Taiwan and its outlying islands were ceded to Japan, who administered Taiwan as a colony until its own defeat at the end of World War II.\n\nIn 1951, Japan signed the San Francisco Treaty, which forced it to relinquish control of Taiwan, including Penghu and the South China Sea Islands.\n\nThe treaty did not specify which, if any, nation should be given sovereignty over Taiwan and the outlying islands, although the US, the main victor of World War II, was the dominant party at the negotiations. This is the legal basis for US President Donald Trump saying \"our one China policy.\"\n\nWashington's position is that the US does not recognize that Taiwan belongs to China, nor does it recognize Taiwan as a sovereign nation.\n\nHowever, the US has at the same time written into law the Taiwan Relations Act, which sets out the legal basis for Taipei's relationship with Washington.\n\nAt the end of the Spanish-American Civil War the US obtained Guam as a spoil of war. Following victory in two world wars, the one \"prize\" claimed by the US was to have primary say over Taiwan's sovereignty. In this respect, Taiwan's and Guam's relationships with the US are rather similar.\n\nFourth, military matters. Today, Taiwan and Guam are inextricably linked. Guam forms a second line of defense for the US. If North Korea were to attack the island, its missiles must first pass through Japanese airspace. The Japanese archipelago is therefore Guam's first line of defense.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T16:48:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {},

In 2002, the directors of the India-Taipei Association (ITA) and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Center (TECC) signed the Agreement on Promotion and Protection of Investment. In 2006, the Taiwan-India Cooperation Council (TICC), a private organisation, was established in Taipei. The two countries signed the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement and the Customs Cooperation Agreement in 2011. In 2004, Taiwan began offering the Taiwan Scholarship and Mandarin Scholarship (National Huayu Enrichment Scholarship) to Indian students. Airlines started direct flights between New Delhi and Taipei in 2003. In 2007, the ITA and the TECC signed an MOU on behalf of India's Department of Science and Technology (DST) under the Ministry of Science and Technology and Taiwan's NSC. These developments have in turn expanded the relationship between the two countries in a number of areas including economic, tourism, science and technology.\n\nWhen the Modi government came to power, the Indian government showed its intent to deepen the engagement with Taiwan under its 'Act East Policy'. Consequently, Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs of Taiwan was invited to attend the 'Vibrant Gujarat' conference in 2015. The victory of the DPP candidate, Tsai Ing-wen, in the presidential election in 2016 increased the prospect of cementing ties between the two countries. Despite China's objection, the Indian government's decision to host delegation of three women MPs from Taiwan in February was further seen as a big move towards firming up the bond, especially when India-China ties are going through an extremely bad phase.\n\nOf course, both the countries have their reasons to accelerate bilateral ties. One area is their bilateral economic and trade engagement. While trade between the two countries has increased from $$1.2 billion in 2000 to $$6 billion in 2016, with nearly 90 Taiwanese companies working in different sectors of the Indian economy, the Tsai government's 'New Southbound Policy' along with Modi government's 'Act East Policy', can play a vital role in deepening economic ties between the two countries. This can be gauged from the fact that in August 2015, Taiwan-based Foxconn, one of the largest hardware manufacturers in the world, announced an investment of $$5 billion in India. Given its huge foreign reserves and expertise in the field of hardware manufacturing, construction, infrastructure, mine exploration, electronic manufacturing, logistics, automobiles, food processing and others, Taiwan can play a vital role in the success of the Modi government's 'Make in India', 'Digital India', and 'Skill India' initiatives. On the other hand, India could significantly reduce the deepening economic ties between China and Taiwan, a stated goal of the Tsai administration as part of her 'New Southbound policy'.\n\nBoth countries face a security threat from China. India has a longstanding border dispute with China and recently Beijing has increased its assertive posturing in those regions. Meanwhile, Beijing has expressed its aim of annexing Taiwan -- by force, if necessary.

The government-sponsored Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) plays an important role in implementing this policy.\n\nDigitimes recently interviewed Danny Liao, director for TAITRA's Taiwan Trade Center in Jakarta. According to Liao, Taiwan vendors have to offer complete solutions rather than just promote individual products for the Indonesia market.\n\nQ: How is Taiwan-based ICT vendors' business promotion in the Indonesia market?\n\nA: Asustek Computer has performed well in marketing as compared with other vendors, especially the selling of Zen Fone 2, and HTC seems to have not made much in marketing. While ICT products do not account for much of Taiwan's exports to Southeast Asia, machinery is the main part. Taiwan's exports to Indonesia in January-June 2017 totaled US$1.55 billion, growing 15.9% on year, and machinery, mainly machine tools, took up 18.2% of the value with the corresponding value increasing 35% on year.\n\nQ: In the Indonesia market, are Taiwan-based vendors' competitors strong?\n\nA: Yes, especially Chine-based vendors Oppo and Vivo. While Samsung Electronics has invested as much as US$3 billion in marketing, China-based vendors have scored points in marketing. For smartphones, Huawei Technologies used to be the largest China-based vendor but has been replaced by Oppo, whose smartphones are relatively high in performance-price ratio, particularly in terms of camera functions.\n\nQ: In view of difficulty in competition, how should Taiwan-based ICT vendor adjust strategies in the Indonesia market?\n\nA: I think that they have to focus on IoT (Internet of Things). In addition, they cannot just sell individual products separately, for complete solutions will have more business opportunities. For example, there are clients inquiring about short-throw projectors, but they want not only hardware but also total solutions based on their requirements. This is a trend Taiwan-based ICT vendors must know. Taiwan-based ICT vendors are not competitive in product pricing and they are not as good as Apple in brand recognition. Young Indonesians are willing to spend, especially on handsets with many of them owning two handsets each. There is big potential demand for handsets in Indonesia, for there are 133 million Internet surfers of which 90% use handsets.\n\nQ: Many Taiwan-based vendors provide solutions but do not know customers' demand in the Indonesia market. How does TAITRA bridge them to customers?\n\nA: TAITRA holds many events a year. For example, Asia IoT Business Platform, an annual forum held in each of Southeast Asian countries, took place in Indonesia on August 7-8, 2017 and showcased IoT solutions offered by Taiwan-based vendors, including Advantech, Marson Technology, Bionime, Acer and Edimax Technology. This is one of TAITRA's matching platforms. TAITRA often organizes groups of Taiwan-based vendors to attend overseas exhibitions and invites foreign buyers to visit Computex Taipei each year.\n\nQ: Does TAITRA hold exhibitions abroad?\n\nA: TAITRA has been holding Taiwan Export image exhibitions in several Southeast Asian countries: the first one already held in Indonesia in May, the second in Vietnam in July, the third to be in the Philippines in September and the fourth to be in Malaysia in November. TAITRA held three forums respectively focusing on precision medicine, ICT/IoT and Taiwan design in Indonesia this year. Through these activities, TAITRA aims to enhance reputation and liking of Taiwan-based brands in overseas markets.\n\nTAITRA fulfills CSR (corporate social responsibility) in Indonesia by hosting Taiwan Excellence Happy Run, an annual street running event beginning 2014. Participation in the event was limited to 2,000 runners in 2014 and 6,000 in 2016. As several main roads in Jakarta are free of cars in the morning of every Sunday, the running event this year was held on May 14. Unlike other running events which charge runners, TAITRA asked Taiwan Excellence Happy Run participants to bring books that they could donate to charity. Many Taiwan-based companies donated their products to the event as prizes for lottery drawing.\n\nQ: Are there statistics about results of overseas exhibitions?\n\nA: There are statistics about Taiwan Export image exhibitions because such events are intended to obtain orders: 150 exhibitors at the Taiwan Export image exhibition in Jakarta in May obtained orders totaling US$49.2 million and the event attracted more than 18,000 visitors. TAITRA commissions Nielsen to survey visitors about their willingness to buy and recommend products to others.\n\nQ: The Indonesia government demands a minimum local content ratio of 30% for 4G smartphones beginning this year. How will Taiwan-based vendors cope?\n\nA: This is a protective policy to attract production of smartphones in Indonesia and introduce foreign technologies. The 30% includes R&D and innovation centers as well as software developed and services provided in Indonesia. However, Indonesia has advantages in marketing including channels rather than production; therefore Taiwan-based vendors have to capitalize on their manufacturing strength and cooperate with local partners.\n\nDanny Liao (right), director for TAITRA's Taiwan Trade Center, Jakarta\n\nPhoto: Judy Lin, Digitimes, August 2017", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T10:33:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 2817, "textStart": 2801, "date": "2017-08-07", "dateEnd": "2017-08-08", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 966, "textStart": 949, "date": "2017-01-", "dateEnd": "2017-06-", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 77, "textStart": 63, "date": "2017-08-18", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 4061, "textStart": 4055, "date": "-05-14", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 5461, "textStart": 5450, "date": "2017-08-", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.658823549747467, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {"liCnt": 5}, "storyUri": "eng-3372969", "time": "10:33:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3372969", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "47", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "100", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Indonesia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Indonesia"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "158", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "177", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "228", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "241", "label": {"eng": "Socialist Republic of Vietnam"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Socialist Republic of Vietnam"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "60864", "label": {"eng": "Jakarta"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jakarta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Indonesia"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302682", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "score": 4}, {"id": "302869", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Internet"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "score": 4}, {"id": "303540", "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 5}, {"id": "305286", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Huawei"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei", "score": 3}, {"id": "307032", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Asus"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "score": 3}, {"id": "308699", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Samsung Electronics"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Electronics", "score": 3}, {"id": "309709", "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 4}, {"id": "313489", "label": {"eng": "Association of Southeast Asian Nations"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Southeast_Asian_Nations", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 4}, {"id": "313490", "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 4}, {"id": "437251", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Computex Taipei"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computex_Taipei", "score": 2}, {"id": "621433", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan External Trade Development Council"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_External_Trade_Development_Council", "score": 5}, {"id": "1309607", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan Excellence Awards"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Excellence_Awards", "score": 2}], "image": null, "timeCrawl": "10:33:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Taiwan ICT vendors have to offer turnkey solutions in Indonesia market: Q&amp;A with TAITRA representative", "originalArticle": null}

I want to make a name for myself and my partners and hopefully expand our business to all over China,\" she explained.\n\nWang receives free housing and office space as an incentive from the Xiamen city government, an example of the perks offered by provincial authorities, which also include generous grants.\n\nAccording to China's Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO), over 6,000 Taiwanese young people are working or interning at more than 50 youth start-up bases launched since 2015.\n\nTop Chinese political and business leaders, including Premier Li Keqiang and Alibaba founder Jack Ma, have also encouraged Taiwanese youth to chase careers in China.\n\nWhile Wang says she has no strong political views, others who do are putting them to one side for jobs.\n\nOne twenty-something has opted to work in China even though he supports Taiwanese independence -- a concept intolerable to Beijing.\n\n\"I just focus on how to do my job well,\" the young worker told AFP on condition of anonymity, saying he hoped it would be a stepping stone to an international career.\n\n\"My Chinese colleagues sometimes say things like 'Taiwan is a part of China' but that's their freedom of speech,\" he said.\n\nDespite being a fully fledged democracy, Taiwan has never announced a formal split from China. Beijing has threatened military action if it ever did.\n\n'Carrots' for youth\n\nThere are already well-established business links between China and Taiwan.\n\nTaiwanese manufacturers flocked to the mainland to take advantage of its resources and cheaper labour after restrictions were lifted in the late 1980s.\n\nChina is also Taiwan's biggest trade partner and market, with exports there totalling $112 billion -- 40 percent of last year's total.\n\nBut the youth links have an extra dimension, says Shih Cheng-feng, a political analyst at National Dong Hwa University.\n\n\"China realises that it needs to take a soft approach and use 'carrots' to attract (young people) in the hope that they will have some impact at critical time, such as the presidential election,\" Shih told AFP.\n\n\"Young people may not actively support Beijing's agenda, but their hostilities can be reduced and that for Beijing is a worthwhile investment,\" he explained.\n\nThere is no official data in

Even as it was being reported that Philadelphia was prepared to offer George a max, it seemed the Clippers remained unwilling to do the same. If Philadelphia is no longer heavily pursuing George, it is even more likely the Clippers will not budge from their current stance.\n\nThe 76ers were not George's only option outside of LA in free agency, but they were seemingly his best, and that now may be off the table for him.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers Star Reveals Honest Feelings on James Harden\n\nExclusive: Russell Westbrook Opens Up About Role With Clippers", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footprint_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Footprint Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Sports", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/The_Philadelphia_Experiment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/The Philadelphia Experiment", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5026,h_2827,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_clippers/01j0vs5hw8bsa3yatbd6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669344", "eventUri": "eng-9669344", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

It has led to widespread speculation that Philadelphia will target a third star to team up with Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey.\n\nThis won't die down any time soon. Philadelphia heads into the summer with a projected $55.51 million in cap room. It's the second most behind the lowly Detroit Pistons.\n\nOne of the players that has been mentioned as a possibility is Los Angeles Clippers star wing Paul George. He has a $48.79 million contract option for next season, one that the nine-time All-Star will decline to hit NBA free agency.\n\nAs for Philadelphia, the primary focus has been the wing position. It makes perfect sense that the Sixers would be interested in George.\n\nThat might no longer be the case.\n\n\"The Philadelphia 76ers' interest in pursuing Paul George has significantly waned in recent days, and the franchise is expected to be aggressive elsewhere with its salary cap flexibility and draft capital leading into next week's NBA Draft.\"\n\nIt could very well be that Morey is looking for a younger option. George turned 34 back in May and has had some injury issues. With Embiid also injury-plagued at times throughout his career, acquiring George on a max contract would come with some risk.\n\nRelated: Updated NBA trade rumors\n\nThere are still a number of directions Philadelphia can go in.\n\nChicago Bulls wing Zach Lavine and Jimmy Butler of the Miami Heat are two options on the trade block. Philadelphia has already been linked to Butler after he played for the team back in 2018-19. Some within the organization believe it was a mistake to let Butler walk to South Beach.\n\nAs for NBA free agency, Golden State Warriors star Klay Thompson has also been bandied about as a possibility. While he's coming off a down season and has dealt with multiple serious injuries, Klay would likely be a cheaper option than George in free agency.\n\nWe're sure to hear other names pop up, too. DeMar DeRozan of the aforementioned Bulls might make sense in a sign-and-trade. Other players will become available on the trade block.\n\nBut one thing is seemingly clear. Philadelphia has pretty much moved on from acquiring George.", "source": {"uri": "sportsnaut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportsnaut.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vincent_frank@sportsnaut.com", "name": "Vincent Frank", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_Morey", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Daryl Morey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Maxey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Maxey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeMar_DeRozan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DeMar DeRozan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/The_Philadelphia_Experiment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/The Philadelphia Experiment", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://sportsnaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Best-NBA-players-Paul-George-22841907.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669344", "eventUri": "eng-9669344", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

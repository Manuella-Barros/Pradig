Polarizing Chicago Sky star Angel Reese got into a heated altercation with Atlanta\u2019s Naz Hillmon during the team\u2019s 89-80 loss to the Dream on Saturday. With the Dream leading 78-75 in the fourth quarter, Hillmon blocked Reese\u2019s shot before staring her down and shouting at her. Reese quickly responded, and appeared to yell \u201cWhat the f\u2013k is wrong with you?\u201d The two were separated by referees, but it had already cooled down and did not become physical. The Dream then posted the clip twice on X, writing that Hillmon was \u201cnot having it!\u201d They later posted the clip again from a different angle, writing \u201cWE KNOW THAT\u2019S RIGHT NAZ!\u201d Hillmon finished with eight points, while Reese scored 13. Reese also added 13 rebounds. The Sky fell to 4-6, and Reese sent a message to her teammates after the game. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s tough,\u201d Reese said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough because I hate losing, and I try to go out there every night and try to be as consistent as I can. \u201cI think having consistency one through 12 is important from the jump ball to the end. It\u2019s not the coaches or the other team, it\u2019s us.\u201d She\u2019s made ample headlines in recent days \u2014 she was ejected from the Sky\u2019s 88-75 loss to the New York Liberty on Tuesday after receiving two technical fouls back-to-back while arguing with a referee, but on Wednesday the WNBA rescinded the second technical foul. And later on Wednesday, Reese claimed on X that a man harassed her and her teammates \u2014 particularly Chennedy Carter \u2014 while they tried to get off their team bus and go to their hotel in Washington D.C. \u201cFinding out our teams hotel to pull with a camera as we get off the bus and put it in my teammates face & HARASS her is NASTY WORK [sic],\u201d Reese posted on X on Wednesday. \u201cThis really is outta control and needs to STOP.\u201d Last week, Reese was fined $1,000 for not making herself available to the media following the Sky\u2019s 71-70 loss to the Indiana Fever. Prior to that game, Reese pushed back on Caitlin Clark receiving credit for the recent surge in interest in the WNBA. \u201cI know I\u2019ll go down in history,\u201d Reese said. \u201cI\u2019ll look back in 20 years and be like: \u2018Yeah, the reason why we\u2019re watching women\u2019s basketball is not just because of one person, it\u2019s because of me too, and I want you to realize that.\u201d", "summary": "With the Dream leading 78-75 in the fourth quarter, Hillmon blocked Reese's shot before staring her down and shouting at her.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/09/sports/angel-reese-gets-in-heated-wnba-altercation-with-naz-hillmon/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-yr4wb8wni-1717942822676.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1717928537&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:51:58", "author": "Jared Schwartz", "authors": ["Jared Schwartz"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.34}

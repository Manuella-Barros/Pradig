An additional 30 children were safeguarded during the operation, which saw collaboration among 27 police forces across Ontario. The charges include the making, possessing, and distributing of child sexual abuse material.\n\nOPP Det. Sgt. Tim Brown detailed one particular case of luring where an individual engaged with an undercover officer online and expressed intentions to meet a child for sexual purposes. Another disturbing discovery involved an individual in possession of about 21 terabytes of data, which included child sexual abuse material stored on various devices and hard drives. To put the magnitude into context, Brown explained that one terabyte could store up to 250,000 photos or 500 hours of video.\n\nThe meticulous process of examining each seized photo and video is time-consuming and challenging, particularly as the storage capacity of devices continues to grow, extending the time needed for investigations. Brown highlighted the evolving complexity of tracking predators due to the use of sophisticated tools such as encryption, dark web activities, and AI-generated images, complicating the task of distinguishing between real and synthetic victims.\n\nThe investigation led to more than 348 charges being laid, and 607 electronic devices were seized. Those charged range across all ages, from teenagers to senior citizens, with some already out on bail for other offenses. Victims identified in these investigations range from infants to teenagers, underscoring the pervasive and indiscriminate nature of this crime.\n\nSince the inception of the Provincial ICE strategy in 2006, focused on internet child exploitation and protecting children from online predators, over 29,000 charges have been laid through tens of thousands of investigations, and almost 4,000 children have been identified and protected.\n\nSigny Arnason, associate director of the Canadian Centre for Child Protection, commented on the troubling growth of online networks where adults with a sexual interest in children share abusive material and tactics. These communities not only distribute child sexual abuse material but also provide support and encouragement to each other, including sharing \"how-to manuals.\" Arnason emphasized that such environments, especially prevalent on the dark web, significantly contribute to what she described as an epidemic-sized issue.\n\nLast year alone, the Canadian Centre for Child Protection received almost 30,000 reports through Canada's national tip line, cybertip.ca, aimed at combating online sexual exploitation and abuse of children, with 23 percent of these reports originating from Ontario. This alarming statistic highlights the urgent need for continued vigilance and coordinated action to combat child exploitation effectively.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Provincial_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ontario Provincial Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Child pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Byte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dark web"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richter magnitude scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Encryption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Centre_for_Child_Protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Centre for Child Protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_predator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online predator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_attraction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual attraction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Sexual_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Sexual Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Rape", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Rape", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://weeklyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GNA2jMqWEAApeew.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549904", "eventUri": "eng-9549904", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Within that period, 29,025 charges were laid against 7,493 people. These completed investigations demonstrate the scope of the issue regarding child sexual abuse material, which remains a pervasive safety issue that is often unseen by many members of the public.\n\nPolice members acknowledged the significant contributions of parents, educators, child advocacy organizations, government and technology providers in combating this issue. Provincial ICE Strategy members urge all parties to remain vigilant and to intensify their involvement to further strengthen the collective effort to protect children from victimization.

Through the Provincial ICE Strategy, we stand together in supporting victims, preventing victimization, and dismantling predatory activities. We are unrelenting in our mission to safeguard children and hold perpetrators accountable.\" -- OPP Commissioner Thomas Carrique\n\n\"Child sexual exploitation is a grave crime with lasting effects. We're dedicated to prevention and accountability. We need everyone's support to combat this community issue. If you see something, report it. Together, we can create a safer environment for all children, ensuring their well-being and protection.\" -- OPP Detective Staff Sergeant Tim Brown, Provincial ICE Strategy Lead\n\n\"When a child is being sexually abused, technology is likely being used to facilitate the ongoing harm. Survivors of child sexual abuse material have repeatedly said how important it is to get the images and videos of their abuse off the internet. Our agency sends 20,000+ removal notices to hosting providers every day. In addition to the critical efforts of police, you can help protect a victim by reporting to Cybertip.ca if you are concerned about someone's online interaction with children.\" -- Signy Arnason, associate executive director, Canadian Centre for Child Protection", "source": {"uri": "orilliamatters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OrilliaMatters.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Child pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Provincial_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ontario Provincial Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oro-Medonte", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oro-Medonte"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oro-Medonte"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Byte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orillia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orillia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orillia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victimisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victimisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Carrique_(police_officer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Carrique (police officer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Centre_for_Child_Protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Centre for Child Protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dundas,_Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dundas, Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dundas, Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akwesasne", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Akwesasne"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_sexual_exploitation_of_children", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial sexual exploitation of children"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staff_sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Staff sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-1-1", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "9-1-1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive director"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Sexual_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Sexual Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Rape", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Rape", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/miscellaneous-stock-images/11-07-18-opp-stock.jpg;w=983;h=620;mode=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549904", "eventUri": "eng-9549904", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-19", "dateEnd": "-02-29", "textStart": 467, "textEnd": 485}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 391, "textEnd": 397}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-02-", "textStart": 1235, "textEnd": 1242}], "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Predators go where children go.\"\n\nHe added that education, awareness and strong enforcement action are \"the foundations for combatting child sexual exploitation on the internet.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Parents need to understand what their kids are doing online,\" continued Brown. \"One of the golden rules of engaging online is if you do not know that person 100-per cent, then you do not know who that person is. They could be hiding behind any name, any age, any picture.\"\n\nIn total, police across the province laid 348 charges as part of Project Aquarius and seized 607 electronic devices.\n\nAmong the accused, including three women, are residents of Guelph, London, Greater Sudbury, Collingwood, Kitchener, Cambridge, Fergus, Chatham, Coleman Township and Oakville. Other accused reside in Burlington, Milton, Thunder Bay, Hamilton, Windsor, Newmarket, Toronto, Vaughan, Niagara Falls, Port Colborne, Fort Erie, St. Catharines and Beamsville. Police also charged residents of Oro Medonte, Simcoe, Corunna, Sault Ste. Marie, Richmond Hill, Oshawa, Brampton, Smiths Falls, Wasaga Beach, Powassan, Peterborough and Kingston.\n\nMost of the charges are for possession of child pornography, accessing child pornography, making available child pornography, making child pornography and distribution of child pornography. Others were charged with voyeurism under 16, voyeurism over 16, luring as person under 16, invitation to sexual touching, sexual interference, exposure, extortion and secretly observe/record person for sexual purpose. One accused, a 37-yer-old Kingston man, was charged with bestiality.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2023, the provincial task force of 27 police agencies completed 82,082 investigations into alleged child sex crimes, laying 29,025 charges against 7,493 people.\n\nHeadlines newsletter\n\nTop stories delivered to your inbox.\n\nSign Up", "source": {"uri": "yorkregion.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nOntario Provincial Police announced the arrests at a news conference in Scarborough on Wednesday morning, thanking 27 police agencies who participated in the investigation including Kingston Police.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMembers of the Provincial Internet Child Exploitation (ICE) Strategy conducted the investigation between February 19 and February 29 of this year, which resulted in 348 total charges placed on the 64 perpetrators.\n\nThose arrested included teenagers, but were primarily adults at a range of ages making, possessing and distributing child sexual abuse material.\n\nOPP Staff Sergeant Tim Brown, lead of the ICE team, said 34 victims were identified and another 30 children were 'safeguarded' - meaning removing a child from a dangerous situation where they could be offended against.\n\nBrown said in the OPP's release that it takes support from the community to tackle child exploitation.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Child sexual exploitation is a grave crime with lasting effects,\" Brown said.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We're dedicated to prevention and accountability. We need everyone's support to combat this community issue.\"\n\nThe OPP highlighted the arrest of individuals including a perpetrator who arranged a meet up with undercover investigators, with the intent of meeting with a child for sexual purposes.\n\nAnother individual who was arrested was discovered with roughly 21 terabytes of child porn.\n\nOver 600 electronic devices were seized as part of the investigation.\n\nBrown said that a majority of investigations as part of Project Aquatic were \"reactive\", stemming from complaints from different electronic service providers, but some were proactive.\n\nAt the OPP's media event, they unveiled a graphic of an iceberg showing the 129 investigations completed during Project Aquatic and the 8,638 investigations completed in 2023 above the surface.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn the iceberg graphic, 82,082 investigations are represented beneath the water, having been completed between 2006 and 2023.\n\nWithin that period, 29,025 charges were laid against 7,493 people - the OPP says it displays the sheer scope of child exploitation issues that many people are simply unaware of.\n\nResources for keeping children safe are available at the Canadian Center for Child Protection or cybertip.ca.\n\nFederal legislation, Bill C-63, that in part is aimed at protecting children against sexual victimization, was tabled in February but has not yet been debated in the House of Commons.", "source": {"uri": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Officials say schools right across the country are struggling to deal with a surge of nude AI-generated content by students.\n\nA recent police-led crackdown on online child sexual exploitation and abuse reveals that predators are becoming \"more sophisticated and harder to trace,\" with the use of AI-generated content, which makes it harder for police to differentiate between real and synthetic victims, provincial police say.\n\nDubbed Project Aquatic, the investigation which ran Feb. 19 to 29, spanned every corner of the province and was able to identify and stop the abuse of 34 child victims. The initiative also clamped down on dozens of individuals now accused of making and distributing child sexual abuse material, said OPP Det. Staff Sergeant Tim Brown Wednesday, during a press conference announcing the results of the project. Police said the victims range from young children up to teenagers, while those being accused of these crimes also cover a broad spectrum of suspects ranging from teenagers to seniors.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"Together we can turn the tide against these heinous crimes,\" Brown said\n\nProject Aquatic saw officers from the 27 police services teaming up with the OPP-led Provincial Strategy to Protect Children from Sexual Abuse and Exploitation on the internet (Provincial ICE [internet Child Exploitation] Strategy) to conduct 129 investigations which resulted in the arrests of 64 individuals across Ontario now facing a total of 348 charges. Investigators also seized 607 digital devices, police say.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Predators go where children go,\" Brown said.\n\nBrown said in many cases the cycle of abuse for the victims continues for months and years, as there is evidence of the pornographic content being released online, leading to a vicious cycle of it being readily available for viewing and sharing by a countless number of people.\n\nBrown said police are seeing troubling trends in the \"digital playgrounds where predators lurk,\" especially as the tools being used by predators are becoming \"more sophisticated and harder to trace,\" that includes the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) generated images, which he says adds yet another element of complexity of police efforts to differentiate between real and synthetic victims and apprehend those who make and distribute child sexual abuse material.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by Signy Arnason, associate executive director, Canadian Centre for Child Protection, who says that in 2022, the agency flagged about 2,600 images it deemed to be AI-generated. That number mushroomed to 3,700 last year, with Arnason saying that with 500 images flagged in just a single month, already this year, \"we're probably on course for 6,000, at least, this year.\"\n\n\"To say it's a nightmare would be an understatement,\" she said, adding that there have been cases of predators using existing child sexual abuse material to create an AI-generated image.\n\n\"You can only imagine the nightmare for those victims, who have a long-standing series, and now there's new abusive imagery of them tied to that,\" she said.\n\nIt also sprung up among school-aged children, where Arnason said there has been increasing evidence of students using nude AI generators to develop explicit AI-generated images of schoolmates.\n\n\"That issue has exploded and we're dealing with schools right across the country where all of a sudden they're having this problem,\" she said. \"We've handed kids very powerful tools, and, in some capacity, they might find it funny, but we know this is incredibly traumatizing and damaging.\"\n\nArnason said there are a \"growing network of adults with a problematic sexual interest in children,\" who operate in online communities where they share child sexual abuse material, promote tactics that include manuals on how to evade detection and \"normalize the sexual abuse and exploitation of children.\"\n\nSome predators show signs of being obsessed over the victims and go as far as trying to track them down and even stalk them well into adulthood, Arnason said.\n\n\"Environments like the dark web fester and facilitate this conduct and AI-generated images have tipped the scale on an already epidemic-sized issue,\" she said Wednesday. \"We know that police across Canada cannot keep up.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nShe said technology companies must shoulder some of the blame as she has seen little signs that these brands will voluntarily prioritize child safety.

Officials say schools right across the country are struggling to deal with a surge of nude AI-generated content by students.\n\nA recent police-led crackdown on online child sexual exploitation and abuse reveals that predators are becoming \"more sophisticated and harder to trace,\" with the use of AI-generated content, which makes it harder for police to differentiate between real and synthetic victims, provincial police say.\n\nDubbed Project Aquatic, the investigation which ran Feb. 19 to 29, spanned every corner of the province and was able to identify and stop the abuse of 34 child victims. The initiative also clamped down on dozens of individuals now accused of making and distributing child sexual abuse material, said OPP Det. Staff Sergeant Tim Brown Wednesday, during a press conference announcing the results of the project. Police said the victims range from young children up to teenagers, while those being accused of these crimes also cover a broad spectrum of suspects ranging from teenagers to seniors.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"Together we can turn the tide against these heinous crimes,\" Brown said\n\nProject Aquatic saw officers from the 27 police services teaming up with the OPP-led Provincial Strategy to Protect Children from Sexual Abuse and Exploitation on the internet (Provincial ICE [internet Child Exploitation] Strategy) to conduct 129 investigations which resulted in the arrests of 64 individuals across Ontario now facing a total of 348 charges. Investigators also seized 607 digital devices, police say.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Predators go where children go,\" Brown said.\n\nBrown said in many cases the cycle of abuse for the victims continues for months and years, as there is evidence of the pornographic content being released online, leading to a vicious cycle of it being readily available for viewing and sharing by a countless number of people.\n\nBrown said police are seeing troubling trends in the \"digital playgrounds where predators lurk,\" especially as the tools being used by predators are becoming \"more sophisticated and harder to trace,\" that includes the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) generated images, which he says adds yet another element of complexity of police efforts to differentiate between real and synthetic victims and apprehend those who make and distribute child sexual abuse material.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by Signy Arnason, associate executive director, Canadian Centre for Child Protection, who says that in 2022, the agency flagged about 2,600 images it deemed to be AI-generated. That number mushroomed to 3,700 last year, with Arnason saying that with 500 images flagged in just a single month, already this year, \"we're probably on course for 6,000, at least, this year.\"\n\n\"To say it's a nightmare would be an understatement,\" she said, adding that there have been cases of predators using existing child sexual abuse material to create an AI-generated image.\n\n\"You can only imagine the nightmare for those victims, who have a long-standing series, and now there's new abusive imagery of them tied to that,\" she said.\n\nIt also sprung up among school-aged children, where Arnason said there has been increasing evidence of students using nude AI generators to develop explicit AI-generated images of schoolmates.\n\n\"That issue has exploded and we're dealing with schools right across the country where all of a sudden they're having this problem,\" she said. \"We've handed kids very powerful tools, and, in some capacity, they might find it funny, but we know this is incredibly traumatizing and damaging.\"\n\nOf the almost 30,000 cybertips.ca received last year, roughly 23 per cent came from Ontario.

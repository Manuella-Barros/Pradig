He also said events such as the group's parliamentary forum strengthen the influence of BRICS on global affairs and help \"make the world safer and more harmonious.\"\n\nThe group's priorities include the achievement of \"positive changes\" in the world economy through the development of reliable financial instruments for settling payments within BRICS, Putin said.\n\nLast month, Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov announced that BRICS finance ministers were examining the possibility of launching a common blockchain-based system of financial settlements that could be used instead of the Western-dominated financial messaging system SWIFT.\n\nMoscow has also accelerated efforts to move away from SWIFT by trading with fellow BRICS nations in national currencies. The trend has been increasingly supported by group members, which have shifted from using the US dollar and euro for trade settlements. The share of national currencies in Russia's settlements with BRICS countries jumped to 85% at the end of 2023, up from 26% two years ago.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BRICS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint Petersburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint Petersburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWIFT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SWIFT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Siluanov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anton Siluanov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_(Russia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Finance (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Conferences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Local_Currency_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Local Currency Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.07/article/668fe40885f540448051e5d9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9725068", "eventUri": "eng-9725068", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

I would like to note that 400 delegates from 18 countries are taking part in it, and this certainly indicates that both BRICS and the parliamentary dimension of BRICS cooperation are enjoying great interest and growing trust from the international community. This is understandable, because the principles of the BRICS work -true equality and consideration of each other's interests - cannot but attract participants in international activities.\n\nYour union is a respectable organisation that was founded back in the late 19th century. Many countries are its members. We welcome the fact that it is now led by a representative of a developing economy in Africa. I am confident that this will be interesting for you.\n\nOn our part, we hope that you will support the work of the BRICS parliamentary dimension, which is important. Not only does it lay the foundation for joint work to strengthen the regulatory framework between participating states, but also it creates a favourable humanitarian atmosphere for achieving common development goals. Once again, I would like to thank you for your participation in the meeting of the BRICS countries' parliamentarians.\n\nWelcome.\n\nTo be continued.\n\nSee also 10th BRICS Parliamentary Forum July 11, 2024 Geography Tanzania Topics BRICS Foreign policy Publication status\n\nPublished in sections: News, Transcripts\n\nPublication date: July 11, 2024, 15:40\n\nDirect link: en.kremlin.ru/d/74530", "source": {"uri": "en.kremlin.ru", "dataType": "news", "title": "President of\u00a0Russia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BRICS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_status", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Observer status"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Parliamentary_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter-Parliamentary Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tanzania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Tanzania"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor_Movement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor Movement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/medium/TZaZSWOBDTD8oyNgQSH9mmOAceACerNJ.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9725068", "eventUri": "eng-9725068", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2011-07-", "textStart": 1622, "textEnd": 1629, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

The event is taking place at the Tauride Palace in St Petersburg.\n\nThe session's theme is The Parliamentary Dimension of BRICS: Prospects for Strengthening Inter-Parliamentary Cooperation.\n\n* * *\n\nPresident of Russia Vladimir Putin: Ms Matviyenko, Mr Volodin, friends.\n\nDear guests,\n\nI am delighted to welcome the participants and organisers of the 10th BRICS Parliamentary Forum.\n\nAlso present here in this room is our distinguished guest, President of the Inter-Parliamentary Union Tulia Ackson. Ms Ackson, we consider your participation in the forum as a sign of support for the constructive partnership among representatives of legislatures in the countries of the Global South and East, and indeed, of all countries interested in constructive interaction and cooperation, and their initiatives on key issues on today's international agenda.\n\nThe theme of this forum, The Role of Parliaments in Strengthening Multilateralism for Just Global Development and Security, is extremely important. It speaks for itself, highlighting the nature of the fundamental global transformations underway today.\n\nYour open discussions, the face-to-face conversations between legislators representing their voters fully align with the principles that underpin BRICS philosophy. These include consideration of each other's interests, reliance on democracy in international relations, respect for sovereignty of nations and their right to determine their own development trajectories.\n\nThese principles are close and understandable to all states parties of the BRICS group, which is growing rapidly and gaining a qualitatively new influence on the global dynamics and developments.\n\nAgain, parliamentary dialogue, including within the BRICS framework, is more important today than ever. After all, as speakers for the interests of your peoples, as representatives of their political and national will, you are keenly aware of the genuine demands, sentiments and needs of millions, or even billions of people on our planet.\n\nI am confident that you will make a significant contribution to the socioeconomic progress of the BRICS countries, and to their citizens' prosperity. And you will certainly do your utmost to reduce international tensions, to create a more just, democratic, multipolar and multilateral world.\n\nTo be continued.\n\nTopics BRICS Foreign policy Publication status\n\nPublished in sections: News, Transcripts\n\nPublication date: July 11, 2024, 14:30\n\nDirect link: en.kremlin.ru/d/74528", "source": {"uri": "en.kremlin.ru", "dataType": "news", "title": "President of\u00a0Russia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BRICS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tauride_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tauride Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentina_Matviyenko", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valentina Matviyenko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Parliamentary_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter-Parliamentary Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint Petersburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint Petersburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_North_and_Global_South", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Global North and Global South"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilateralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multilateralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarity_(international_relations)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Polarity (international relations)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Socioeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/medium/M5pXOIY5GCMVE6tcfnAuyxHcdpAXAEd7.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9725068", "eventUri": "eng-9725068", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2011-07-", "textStart": 2511, "textEnd": 2518}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Under parliamentary diplomacy, we exchange ideas, innovative laws and best practices through inter-parliamentary forums such as the BRICS Parliamentary Forum, Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) and Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU),\" he said.\n\n\"Inter-parliamentary cooperation is vital to promote inclusive growth. Parliaments play a central role in protecting the interests and expressing the concerns of emerging markets and developing countries and the role of the BRICS Parliamentary Forum should be seen in this light. We are happy that today BRICS is striving to establish a more inclusive global governance system,\" Birla added.\n\nThe speaker added that climate change, inclusive socio-economic development, food and nutrition security, and attainment of SDG goals are challenges for the present world whose immediate solution is necessary to secure the common future of humanity. \"The role of our parliaments

Russian President Vladimir Putin likened the West's use of so-called rules instead of international law to classic colonialism.\n\nSpeaking at the BRICS Parliamentary Forum, he gave a description of the behavior of ruling elites in the so-called golden billion countries.\n\n\"Acting contrary to historical logic and often even to the detriment of the long-term interests of their own peoples, they are now seeking to establish some kind of order based on their so-called rules, which no one has seen, no one has discussed and no one has ever accepted,\" Putin stated.\n\n\"These rules are written and adjusted anew for each situation in the interests of those who consider themselves exceptional and have conferred on themselves the right to dictate their will to others,\" the president said. \"It's exactly in the best traditions of classical colonialism.\"\n\n\"This is a clear attempt to replace legitimate international law, an attempt to create a monopoly on the ultimate truth,\" Putin continued. \"Such a monopoly is destructive.\"\n\n\"Pressure is growing on those who have their own position,\" he went on to say. \"Contrary to the principles of international law, what comes into play is forceful coercion, unilateral sanctions, and selective application of trade rules.\"\n\nPutin said that the elites of the so-called golden billion countries fiercely resist the efforts of BRICS members to create a multipolar world order.\n\n\"We are well aware that the establishment of a world order that reflects the real balance of power, the new geopolitical, economic and demographic reality, is a complicated and in many ways, unfortunately, even painful process,\" the president said.\n\n\"Efforts of the BRICS members and other developing countries face fierce resistance from the ruling elites of the so-called golden billion nations,\" he stated.", "source": {"uri": "tass.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TASS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BRICS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TASS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TASS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarity_(international_relations)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polarity (international relations)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colonialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Classical antiquity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_power_(international_relations)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balance of power (international relations)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://cdn-media.tass.ru/width/1200_4ce85301/tass/m2/en/uploads/i/20240711/1423767.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9725068", "eventUri": "eng-9725068", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 179, "textEnd": 186}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Speaking at a brewery in his constituency of Holborn and St Pancras, Sir Keir Starmer criticised the Conservative Government for failing to \u201cfix\u201d the system which he said has caused problems for businesses for a \u201clong time\u201d. The party is also pledging to accelerate the establishment of banking hubs, stamp out late payments of invoices by forcing large firms to report on their payment practices, and crack down on antisocial behaviour to \u201crevitalise\u201d high streets. Speaking at 3 Locks Brewing Company in Camden, the Labour leader said a \u201cbetter system\u201d was coming, adding: \u201cWe want to replace them with a system that works better, because at the moment there\u2019s not a level playing field between businesses that are online and those that are sort of bricks and mortar. \u201cIt\u2019s been a problem for a long time, the Government hasn\u2019t fixed it and small businesses have all gone through a really hard time in recent years. \u201cSo that\u2019s our plan, we want small businesses to thrive because they are the backbone of our economy and they need that stability in our economy, and they need to know that their energy bills are actually going to be lower and stable.\u201d Labour first put forward its plan to \u201cbreathe new life\u201d into Britain\u2019s high streets in April, drawing approval from trade bodies for its proposed overhaul of the business rates system. But it is not clear what Labour would replace business rates with, leading some to call for more clarity. After pulling the first pint of the day at 10.55am, Sir Keir said that \u201cif all else fails\u201d, he will be back at the north London brewery on July 5. He was joined by Dragons\u2019 Den star Deborah Meaden, who described the party\u2019s Great British Energy plans as \u201cabsolutely brilliant\u201d. She told the PA news agency: \u201cI think GB Energy is absolutely brilliant, I think it does everything that I care about. \u201cBusinesses don\u2019t like being out of control of costs and energy is one of those costs that simply fluctuates beyond your control.\u201d Sir Keir said his party\u2019s Great British Energy plan is \u201cvery popular\u201d with small businesses. \u201cThey\u2019ve had a really hard time with this Government in recent years, so our plan is to support small businesses and give them that chance that they need,\u201d he said. \u201cThat does involve replacing rates, because business rates put a real drag on businesses. It also involves stabilising the economy, of course, and Great British Energy, because what\u2019s come up here comes up with all small businesses \u2013 energy is too expensive. \u201cWhat you can\u2019t have if you run a small business is sort of costs that you can\u2019t control, so Great British Energy, a publicly owned company for renewables, is very, very popular with small businesses.\u201d Asked if he would be cutting taxes, Sir Keir said there \u201cwon\u2019t be any surprises on tax\u201d in Labour\u2019s manifesto. He added: \u201cAll of our plans are fully costed, fully funded, none of them involving tax rises over and above those that we have already set out.\u201d At the canal-side craft brewery, Sir Keir met young people who are voting for the first time this year. The students said scrapping the Rwanda migrants scheme, helping young adults through the cost-of-living crisis and improving the education system should be priorities for the next government. One of the students, Dan Bilenga, said he had met Sir Keir previously when he bumped into him on the streets of Camden and asked him for a work experience opportunity. The 18-year-old told PA: \u201cI told him my situation said I was looking for some work experience, and then I wasn\u2019t expecting anything but he got back to me.\u201d Mr Bilenga, who attends Leeds University where Sir Keir studied, added: \u201cHe\u2019s a real guy, he sticks to his word, he said he would do something and he did it.\u201d", "summary": "The party is also pledging to accelerate the establishment of banking hubs and stamp out late payment of invoices.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/business/business-news/labour-vows-to-level-playing-field-for-small-businesses-with-overhaul-of-rates-b1163055.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/08/13/5e73af4221ea92e53c43246a3b55d68cY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE3OTM1Njg1-2.76451623.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:30:50", "author": "Rhiannon James", "authors": ["Rhiannon James"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.198}

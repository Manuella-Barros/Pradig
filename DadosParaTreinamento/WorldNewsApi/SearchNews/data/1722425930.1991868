In an order released Friday, the Superior Court judges threw out the complaint filed in January by several voters who attempt to block enforcement of redistricting that they said creates outsized preferences that favor one side - in this case benefitting Republicans. In a 2023 ruling by the state Supreme Court, the GOP majority said the judiciary lacked authority to declare redistricting maps as illegal partisan gerrymanders. They also said that redistricting was a political matter the judicial branch must stay out of, save for challenges on specific limitations. The voters\u2019 lawyer argued in a court hearing earlier this month that the 2023 decision didn\u2019t apply to his lawsuit, which described an implicit though unspecified right within the state constitution to fair elections. The lawsuit cites specific language in the constitution that \u201celections shall be often held\u201d and that \u201call elections shall be free.\u201d But the order signed Superior Court Judges Jeffery Foster, Angela Pickett and Ashley Gore reads that the 2023 opinion by the Supreme Court still controls the outcome in this case. That\u2019s the argument also made by Republican legislative leaders who were among the lawsuit defendants. \u201cThe issues raised by Plaintiffs are clearly of a political nature,\u201d the order dated Thursday said. \u201cThere is not a judicially discoverable or manageable standard by which to decide them, and resolution by the Panel would require us to make policy determinations that are better suited for the policymaking branch of government, namely, the General Assembly.\u201d Spokespeople for state House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger, as well as a representative for the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to emails late Friday seeking a response to the dismissal. The plaintiffs can appeal the decision. The lawsuit is among four filed in North Carolina to challenge congressional and legislative boundaries drawn by the GOP-dominated General Assembly last fall for use in elections through 2030 that favor Republicans electorally. The other three, still pending, were filed in federal court and focus on claims of illegal racial gerrymandering. The \u201cfair elections\u201d lawsuit focuses on a handful of districts. Each of the three judges hearing the lawsuit are registered Republicans. Chief Justice Paul Newby, a Republican who wrote the prevailing opinion in the 2023 redistricting ruling, chooses three-judge panels to hear such cases.", "summary": "North Carolina trial judges have dismissed a lawsuit challenging redrawn legislative and congressional district lines on the argument that they run afoul of an indirect constitutional right to \"fair elections.\" The judges said a recent affirmation still applies - that redistricting policy decisions are left to the General Assembly, not the courts.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jun/28/north-carolina-redistricting-lawsuit-over-right-to/", "image": "https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/06/13/Redistricting_Lawsuit_North_Carolina_51147.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:28:24", "author": "Gary D.

Ryan Mallett threw for 113 yards and a touchdown , Josh Woodrum ran for two more scores and the Baltimore Ravens beat the Dolphins 31-7 on Thursday night in the second preseason game for both teams.\n\n\"Dr. Bowen in Chicago, nice job,\" Cutler said, with a thumbs-up for emphasis.\n\nCutler played the first two series for the Dolphins, his debut as injured starter Ryan Tannehill's replacement in Miami. He was 3 of 6 for 24 yards , some of it in a no-huddle tempo, and his highlight play was one that didn't count. Facing a third-and-16, Cutler stepped up and found DeVante Parker for what would have been a 31-yard gain -- one erased by a holding flag.\n\n\"Thought he was good,\" said Dolphins coach Adam Gase, who also coached Cutler in Chicago. \"First time out. Looks like we really weren't apart for a year. His tempo was really good.\"\n\nCutler took a big hit on his last snap, courtesy of the Ravens' Za'Darius Smith. He got up without any problem, then switched his helmet for a baseball cap and headset.\n\n\"I was kind of glad to get that one out of the way,\" Cutler said.\n\nRavens starting quarterback Joe Flacco isn't expected to play until Week 1 of the regular season because of back woes, and Mallett played the entire first half.\n\n\"I thought he did good,\" Ravens coach John Harbaugh said. \"He got out of trouble a few times. He made a few throws.\"\n\nMallett completed 13 of 22 passes, getting intercepted twice -- both on passes intended for Quincy Adeboyejo. The first pick was by Xavier Howard on a ball lofted down the left sideline and overthrow, the other coming when Cordrea Tankersley ripped the ball out of Adeboyejo's hands after he had to reach back to make a catch on a quick slant.\n\n\"I think I played better,\" Mallett said. \"There's still plays to be made.\"\n\nWoodrum completed eight of 10 passes for 110 yards.\n\n\"He's got some poise, he can play the game,\" Harbaugh said.\n\nSenorise Perry had an 11-yard touchdown run for Miami, but he also fumbled away a kickoff return -- one of many Miami special-teams miscues. The Dolphins also had a punt blocked in the second quarter, setting up Mallett's 1-yard touchdown toss to Larry Donnell, and later had a hold on a kickoff return.\n\nGase said Miami had 10 men on the field for the blocked punt.\n\n\"It's one of those unforced errors we can't have happen,\" Gase said.\n\nTUCKER AUTOMATIC\n\nRavens kicker Justin Tucker is automatic from 50 yards or more.\n\nTucker connected on a 52-yarder for the Ravens' first points of the night. He also made a 59-yarder in Baltimore's preseason-opening win over Washington, and was 10 for 10 on tries from 50 yards or more last season.\n\nTucker also recovered a fumble on a misplayed kickoff return, one of Miami's many special-teams issues. But Tucker also tried to scoop-and-score the fumble recovery, drawing serious ire from Terrell Suggs and others on the Ravens sideline.\n\n\"Suggs was about to strangle him when he came off,\" Harbaugh said.\n\nSaid Tucker: \"Obviously, I'm better with my feet than my hands.\"\n\nQB WATCH\n\nDolphins backup Matt Moore, like Cutler, was also done for the night by the time the first quarter was over. He completed 3 of 5 passes for 11 yards, before getting relieved by David Fales. Brandon Doughty came in for Miami in the second half.\n\nCOMING HOME\n\nBaltimore's third quarterback, Thaddeus Lewis, was enjoying a homecoming. He played his high school ball at nearby Hialeah-Miami Lakes High.\n\nTOUGH START\n\nDolphins offensive lineman Sam Young was flagged for holding on consecutive plays in the first quarter, including one that wiped out the Cutler-to-Parker play for 31 yards.\n\nMORE OF THE SAME\n\nThe Ravens and Dolphins last met in December, with Baltimore winning that matchup 38-6.

Ryan Mallett threw for 113 yards and a touchdown , Josh Woodrum ran for two more scores and the Baltimore Ravens beat the Dolphins 31-7 on Thursday night in the second preseason game for both teams.\n\n\"Dr. Bowen in Chicago, nice job,\" Cutler said, with a thumbs-up for emphasis.\n\nCutler played the first two series for the Dolphins, his debut as injured starter Ryan Tannehill's replacement in Miami. He was 3 of 6 for 24 yards , some of it in a no-huddle tempo, and his highlight play was one that didn't count. Facing a third-and-16, Cutler stepped up and found DeVante Parker for what would have been a 31-yard gain -- one erased by a holding flag.\n\n\"Thought he was good,\" said Dolphins coach Adam Gase, who also coached Cutler in Chicago. \"First time out. Looks like we really weren't apart for a year. His tempo was really good.\"\n\nCutler took a big hit on his last snap, courtesy of the Ravens' Za'Darius Smith. He got up without any problem, then switched his helmet for a baseball cap and headset.\n\n\"I was kind of glad to get that one out of the way,\" Cutler said.\n\nRavens starting quarterback Joe Flacco isn't expected to play until Week 1 of the regular season because of back woes, and Mallett played the entire first half.\n\n\"I thought he did good,\" Ravens coach John Harbaugh said. \"He got out of trouble a few times. He made a few throws.\"\n\nMallett completed 13 of 22 passes, getting intercepted twice -- both on passes intended for Quincy Adeboyejo. The first pick was by Xavier Howard on a ball lofted down the left sideline and overthrow, the other coming when Cordrea Tankersley ripped the ball out of Adeboyejo's hands after he had to reach back to make a catch on a quick slant.\n\n\"I think I played better,\" Mallett said. \"There's still plays to be made.\"\n\nWoodrum completed eight of 10 passes for 110 yards.\n\n\"He's got some poise, he can play the game,\" Harbaugh said.\n\nSenorise Perry had an 11-yard touchdown run for Miami, but he also fumbled away a kickoff return -- one of many Miami special-teams miscues. The Dolphins also had a punt blocked in the second quarter, setting up Mallett's 1-yard touchdown toss to Larry Donnell, and later had a hold on a kickoff return.\n\nGase said Miami had 10 men on the field for the blocked punt.\n\n\"It's one of those unforced errors we can't have happen,\" Gase said.\n\nTUCKER AUTOMATIC\n\nRavens kicker Justin Tucker is automatic from 50 yards or more.\n\nTucker connected on a 52-yarder for the Ravens' first points of the night. He also made a 59-yarder in Baltimore's preseason-opening win over Washington, and was 10 for 10 on tries from 50 yards or more last season.\n\nTucker also recovered a fumble on a misplayed kickoff return, one of Miami's many special-teams issues. But Tucker also tried to scoop-and-score the fumble recovery, drawing serious ire from Terrell Suggs and others on the Ravens sideline.\n\n\"Suggs was about to strangle him when he came off,\" Harbaugh said.\n\nSaid Tucker: \"Obviously, I'm better with my feet than my hands.\"\n\nQB WATCH\n\nDolphins backup Matt Moore, like Cutler, was also done for the night by the time the first quarter was over. He completed 3 of 5 passes for 11 yards, before getting relieved by David Fales. Brandon Doughty came in for Miami in the second half.\n\nCOMING HOME\n\nBaltimore's third quarterback, Thaddeus Lewis, was enjoying a homecoming. He played his high school ball at nearby Hialeah-Miami Lakes High.\n\nTOUGH START\n\nDolphins offensive lineman Sam Young was flagged for holding on consecutive plays in the first quarter, including one that wiped out the Cutler-to-Parker play for 31 yards.\n\nMORE OF THE SAME\n\nThe Ravens and Dolphins last met in December, with Baltimore winning that matchup 38-6.

Ryan Mallett threw for 113 yards and a touchdown , Josh Woodrum ran for two more scores and the Baltimore Ravens beat the Dolphins 31-7 on Thursday night in the second preseason game for both teams.\n\n\"Dr. Bowen in Chicago, nice job,\" Cutler said, with a thumbs-up for emphasis.\n\nCutler played the first two series for the Dolphins, his debut as injured starter Ryan Tannehill's replacement in Miami. He was 3 of 6 for 24 yards , some of it in a no-huddle tempo, and his highlight play was one that didn't count. Facing a third-and-16, Cutler stepped up and found DeVante Parker for what would have been a 31-yard gain - one erased by a holding flag.\n\n\"Thought he was good,\" said Dolphins coach Adam Gase, who also coached Cutler in Chicago. \"First time out. Looks like we really weren't apart for a year. His tempo was really good.\"\n\nCutler took a big hit on his last snap, courtesy of the Ravens' Za'Darius Smith. He got up without any problem, then switched his helmet for a baseball cap and headset.\n\n\"I was kind of glad to get that one out of the way,\" Cutler said.\n\nRavens starting quarterback Joe Flacco isn't expected to play until Week 1 of the regular season because of back woes, and Mallett played the entire first half.\n\n\"I thought he did good,\" Ravens coach John Harbaugh said. \"He got out of trouble a few times. He made a few throws.\"\n\nMallett completed 13 of 22 passes, getting intercepted twice - both on passes intended for Quincy Adeboyejo. The first pick was by Xavier Howard on a ball lofted down the left sideline and overthrow, the other coming when Cordrea Tankersley ripped the ball out of Adeboyejo's hands after he had to reach back to make a catch on a quick slant.\n\n\"I think I played better,\" Mallett said. \"There's still plays to be made.\"\n\nWoodrum completed eight of 10 passes for 110 yards.\n\n\"He's got some poise, he can play the game,\" Harbaugh said.\n\nSenorise Perry had an 11-yard touchdown run for Miami, but he also fumbled away a kickoff return - one of many Miami special-teams miscues. The Dolphins also had a punt blocked in the second quarter, setting up Mallett's 1-yard touchdown toss to Larry Donnell, and later had a hold on a kickoff return.\n\nGase said Miami had 10 men on the field for the blocked punt.\n\n\"It's one of those unforced errors we can't have happen,\" Gase said.\n\nRavens kicker Justin Tucker is automatic from 50 yards or more.\n\nTucker connected on a 52-yarder for the Ravens' first points of the night. He also made a 59-yarder in Baltimore's preseason-opening win over Washington, and was 10 for 10 on tries from 50 yards or more last season.\n\nTucker also recovered a fumble on a misplayed kickoff return, one of Miami's many special-teams issues. But Tucker also tried to scoop-and-score the fumble recovery, drawing serious ire from Terrell Suggs and others on the Ravens sideline.\n\n\"Suggs was about to strangle him when he came off,\" Harbaugh said.\n\nSaid Tucker: \"Obviously, I'm better with my feet than my hands.\"\n\nDolphins backup Matt Moore, like Cutler, was also done for the night by the time the first quarter was over. He completed 3 of 5 passes for 11 yards, before getting relieved by David Fales. Brandon Doughty came in for Miami in the second half.\n\nBaltimore's third quarterback, Thaddeus Lewis, was enjoying a homecoming. He played his high school ball at nearby Hialeah-Miami Lakes High.\n\nDolphins offensive lineman Sam Young was flagged for holding on consecutive plays in the first quarter, including one that wiped out the Cutler-to-Parker play for 31 yards.\n\nThe Ravens and Dolphins last met in December, with Baltimore winning that matchup 38-6.

After being with the Dolphins organization for almost two weeks, Cutler is set to play in his first game with the team against the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nThis will be the first time Cutler has played in any kind of game since November 20, when he was a member of the Chicago Bears. Not long after his last game in November, Cutler had season-ending shoulder surgery and missed the rest of the season.\n\nChicago released Cutler in March after playing eight seasons with the team. Cutler was cleared by doctors in March, but he briefly retired to enter the Fox broadcasting booth before returning to football on August 6.\n\nCutler has familiarity with Dolphins head coach Adam Gase's system dating back to when Gase was the offensive coordinator of the Bears in 2015. Thursday night will give Cutler an opportunity to achieve rhythm and chemistry with his new receivers.\n\n\"He's pretty much got the offense down, it's just more about timing,\" Gase said after practice on Monday. \"It's more mental, just kind of that feel of when to turn the ball loose, getting used to the receivers, the d-line rushing. I guess (our d-line) is a good d-line to get used to getting in your face a little bit. It's happening fast, so it's probably going to be good for him at the end of the day when we start playing some other teams. Our d-line is tough to go against. They get back there quick.\"\n\nIn his limited work during training camp, Cutler has had his good and bad days. The good was when he threw a 40-yard pass to receiver DeVante Parker or when Cutler connected on a deep touchdown pass to Jakeem Grant. The bad was when Cutler threw two end zone interceptions in one practice.\n\nMiami will have to take the positives and negatives when it comes to Cutler. There will times where Cutler looks like one of the better signal-callers in the NFL. But there will be other times where he forces the football into tight coverage and that leaves him prone to interceptions.\n\nIf Gase can get Cutler playing like how he did in 2015 when he threw for 3,659 yards, 21 touchdowns against 11 interceptions, the Dolphins will have an opportunity to return to the playoffs again in 2017.\n\nAfter not playing for almost nine months, Thursday's game against the Ravens will be a good step forward for Cutler. But it is still preseason, so it will be hard to predict how Cutler will perform once the live regular season action begins.", "id": "9806729", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Dolphins: Welcome to the Jay Cutler era", "image": "https://usatdolphinswire.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/usatsi_10209931.jpg?w=640", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 305, "date": "-11-20", "amb": false, "textEnd": 316}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 688, "date": "2017-08-06", "amb": false, "textEnd": 696}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "182034", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "206540", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "id": "302552", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"}, {"label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}, "id": "302611", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown"}, {"label": {"eng": "Interception"}, "id": "304976", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception"}, {"label": {"eng": "Head coach"}, "id": "305436", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach"}, {"label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}, "id": "305439", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "id": "305661", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}, "id": "308747", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company"}, {"label": {"eng": "End zone"}, "id": "310129", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rush (gridiron football)"}, "id": "324223", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(gridiron_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Thursday Night Football"}, "id": "330672", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday_Night_Football"}, {"label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}, "id": "331328", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins"}, {"label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}, "id": "335402", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adam Gase"}, "id": "341272", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Gase"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}, "id": "342459", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jay Cutler (American football)"}, "id": "355416", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Cutler_(American_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "DeVante Parker"}, "id": "1275204", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeVante_Parker"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 49, "label": "dmoz/Games", "uri": "dmoz/Games"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 93, "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora and Fauna", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora_and_Fauna"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 137, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}], "time": "10:32:00"}

Cutler overthrew his wideout.\n\nAnother long third down failed when Cutler was quickly pressured up the middle by the Ravens Za'Darius Smith and tried to dump the ball off; the closest receiver was running back Damien Williams. Cutler got planted in the Hard Rock Stadium turf by Smith.\n\nAnd that was the end of his night.\n\nMatt Moore came on at quarterback when Cutler left the game, but even Moore did not play long before ceding the offense to third-string QB David Fales.", "id": "9806696", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Jay Cutler's debut for Dolphins is brief and not very productive", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ge6cNos966mKUm.AKhrGZw--/aD0yMjEzO3c9Mjk2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/22919084352607a5367ce125f1f1c6e8", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "182034", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Head coach"}, "id": "305436", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach"}, {"label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}, "id": "305439", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}, "id": "310130", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver"}, {"label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "id": "324224", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back"}, {"label": {"eng": "Down (American and Canadian football)"}, "id": "326127", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_(American_and_Canadian_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}, "id": "331328", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins"}, {"label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}, "id": "335402", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adam Gase"}, "id": "341272", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Gase"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}, "id": "342459", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jay Cutler (American football)"}, "id": "355416", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Cutler_(American_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sam Young (basketball)"}, "id": "579069", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Young_(basketball)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jay Ajayi"}, "id": "1270836", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Ajayi"}, {"label": {"eng": "2015 Cleveland Browns season"}, "id": "1342797", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Cleveland_Browns_season"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 93, "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora and Fauna", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora_and_Fauna"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}], "time": "22:32:00"}

(AP) -- Jay Cutler's night started by getting an ovation from Miami Dolphins fans just for taking the field, and ended with him giving a shout-out to Mark Bowen.\n\nThat's the surgeon who fixed his right shoulder after his season with the Chicago Bears ended last December.\n\nCutler's shoulder is just fine, and that's about all Miami had to cheer about. Ryan Mallett threw for 113 yards and a touchdown , Josh Woodrum ran for two more scores and the Baltimore Ravens beat the Dolphins 31-7 on Thursday night in the second preseason game for both teams.\n\n\"Dr. Bowen in Chicago, nice job,\" Cutler said, with a thumbs-up for emphasis.\n\nSponsored Content: Sign up for a free webinar as DoD, Air Force and VA offer insights on cybersecurity strategies.\n\nCutler played the first two series for the Dolphins, his debut as injured starter Ryan Tannehill's replacement in Miami. He was 3 of 6 for 24 yards , some of it in a no-huddle tempo, and his highlight play was one that didn't count. Facing a third-and-16, Cutler stepped up and found DeVante Parker for what would have been a 31-yard gain -- one erased by a holding flag.\n\n\"Thought he was good,\" said Dolphins coach Adam Gase, who also coached Cutler in Chicago. \"First time out. Looks like we really weren't apart for a year. His tempo was really good.\"\n\nCutler took a big hit on his last snap, courtesy of the Ravens' Za'Darius Smith. He got up without any problem, then switched his helmet for a baseball cap and headset.\n\n\"I was kind of glad to get that one out of the way,\" Cutler said.\n\nRavens starting quarterback Joe Flacco isn't expected to play until Week 1 of the regular season because of back woes, and Mallett played the entire first half.\n\n\"I thought he did good,\" Ravens coach John Harbaugh said. \"He got out of trouble a few times. He made a few throws.\"\n\nPostal Service may be able to raise price of stamps this fall\n\nMallett completed 13 of 22 passes, getting intercepted twice -- both on passes intended for Quincy Adeboyejo. The first pick was by Xavier Howard on a ball lofted down the left sideline and overthrow, the other coming when Cordrea Tankersley ripped the ball out of Adeboyejo's hands after he had to reach back to make a catch on a quick slant.\n\n\"I think I played better,\" Mallett said. \"There's still plays to be made.\"\n\nWoodrum completed eight of 10 passes for 110 yards.\n\n\"He's got some poise, he can play the game,\" Harbaugh said.\n\nSenorise Perry had an 11-yard touchdown run for Miami, but he also fumbled away a kickoff return -- one of many Miami special-teams miscues. The Dolphins also had a punt blocked in the second quarter, setting up Mallett's 1-yard touchdown toss to Larry Donnell, and later had a hold on a kickoff return.\n\nGase said Miami had 10 men on the field for the blocked punt.\n\n\"It's one of those unforced errors we can't have happen,\" Gase said.\n\nTUCKER AUTOMATIC\n\nRavens kicker Justin Tucker is automatic from 50 yards or more.\n\nTucker connected on a 52-yarder for the Ravens' first points of the night. He also made a 59-yarder in Baltimore's preseason-opening win over Washington, and was 10 for 10 on tries from 50 yards or more last season.\n\nTucker also recovered a fumble on a misplayed kickoff return, one of Miami's many special-teams issues. But Tucker also tried to scoop-and-score the fumble recovery, drawing serious ire from Terrell Suggs and others on the Ravens sideline.\n\n\"Suggs was about to strangle him when he came off,\" Harbaugh said.\n\nSaid Tucker: \"Obviously, I'm better with my feet than my hands.\"\n\nQB WATCH\n\nDolphins backup Matt Moore, like Cutler, was also done for the night by the time the first quarter was over. He completed 3 of 5 passes for 11 yards, before getting relieved by David Fales. Brandon Doughty came in for Miami in the second half.\n\nCOMING HOME\n\nBaltimore's third quarterback, Thaddeus Lewis, was enjoying a homecoming. He played his high school ball at nearby Hialeah-Miami Lakes High.\n\nTOUGH START\n\nDolphins offensive lineman Sam Young was flagged for holding on consecutive plays in the first quarter, including one that wiped out the Cutler-to-Parker play for 31 yards.\n\nMORE OF THE SAME\n\nThe Ravens and Dolphins last met in December, with Baltimore winning that matchup 38-6. Baltimore is 25-9 in its last 34 preseason games.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "id": "9816731", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Cutler

(AP) -- Jay Cutler ran onto the field with the Miami Dolphins for the first time, and the fans greeted their new quarterback with a loud ovation.\n\nThey didn't have much else to cheer about over the next three hours.\n\nMore Miami Dolphins news Jay Cutler makes Dolphins debut in preseason loss to RavensMiami Dolphins lose another player to injury for seasonDolphins reportedly sign undrafted WR Trey GriffeyDolphins center Mike Pouncey sticking to slow and steady to plan to ready for seasonDolphins RB Jay Ajayi dons pads, joins drills for 1st time since concussion\n\nRyan Mallett threw for 113 yards and a touchdown, Josh Woodrum ran for two more scores and the Baltimore Ravens beat the Dolphins 31-7 on Thursday night in the second preseason game for both teams.\n\nCutler played the first two series for the Dolphins, his debut as injured starter Ryan Tannehill's replacement in Miami. He was 3 of 6 for 24 yards, some of it in a no-huddle tempo, and his highlight play was one that didn't count. Facing a third-and-16, Cutler stepped up and found DeVante Parker for what would have been a 31-yard gain -- one erased by a holding flag.\n\n\"He was good. We kind of got the tempo going and got comfortable,\" Dolphins coach Adam Gase said. \"He had a couple really nice moves in the pocket, pushing up and making a couple guys miss. We had penalties on the play, so it was negated, but he felt good.\"\n\nCutler took a big hit on his last snap, courtesy of the Ravens' Za'Darius Smith. He got up without any problem, then switched his helmet for a baseball cap and headset.\n\n\"He's having fun,\" Gase said.\n\nRavens starting quarterback Joe Flacco isn't expected to play until Week 1 of the regular season because of back woes, and Mallett played the entire first half.\n\nMallett completed 13 of 22 passes, getting intercepted twice -- both on passes intended for Quincy Adeboyejo. The first pick was by Xavier Howard on a ball lofted down the left sideline and overthrow, the other coming when Cordrea Tankersley ripped the ball out of Adeboyejo's hands after he had to reach back to make a catch on a quick slant.\n\nWoodrum completed eight of 10 passes for 110 yards.\n\nThe Dolphins' storyline coming into Thursday was all about Cutler, and his first game action with Miami. For as much hubbub as there was for that, there likely was as much concern about special teams when the night ended.\n\nSenorise Perry had an 11-yard touchdown run for Miami, but he also fumbled away a kickoff return -- one of many Miami special-teams miscues. The Dolphins also had a punt blocked in the second quarter, setting up Mallett's 1-yard touchdown toss to Larry Donnell, and later had a hold on a kickoff return.\n\nGase said Miami had 10 men on the field for the blocked punt.\n\n\"It's one of those unforced errors we can't have happen,\" Gase said.\n\nTUCKER AUTOMATIC\n\nRavens kicker Justin Tucker is automatic from 50 yards or more.\n\nTucker connected on a 52-yarder for the Ravens' first points of the night. He also made a 59-yarder in Baltimore's preseason-opening win over Washington, and was 10 for 10 on tries from 50 yards or more last season.\n\nTucker also recovered a fumble on a misplayed kickoff return, one of Miami's many special-teams issues.\n\nQB WATCH\n\nDolphins backup Matt Moore, like Cutler, was also done for the night by the time the first quarter was over. He completed 3 of 5 passes for 11 yards, before getting relieved by David Fales. Brandon Doughty came in for Miami in the second half.\n\nCOMING HOME\n\nBaltimore's third quarterback, Thaddeus Lewis, was enjoying a homecoming. He played his high school ball at nearby Hialeah-Miami Lakes High.\n\nTOUGH START\n\nDolphins offensive lineman Sam Young was flagged for holding on consecutive plays in the first quarter, including one that wiped out the Cutler-to-Parker play for 31 yards.\n\nMORE OF THE SAME\n\nThe Ravens and Dolphins last met in December, with Baltimore winning that matchup 38-6. Baltimore is 25-9 in its last 34 preseason games.\n\n118\n\nView Gallery Gallery: Miami Dolphins cheerleaders\n\nSteve Mitchell-USA TODAY Sports | Steve Mitchell", "id": "9810457", "details": {},

Miami has less than a month to groom Cutler from being semi-retired to a starting quarterback.\n\n\"He's pretty much got the offense down, it's just more about timing,\" Dolphins head coach Adam Gase said this week. \"It's more mental, just kind of that feel of when to turn the ball loose, getting used to the receivers, the D-line rushing. I guess [our defensive line) is a good D-line to get used to getting in your face a little bit. It's happening fast, so it's probably going to be good for him at the end of the day when we start playing some other teams.\"\n\nBased on Cutler's career arc, there will be times this season when he will look like Dan Marino. There also will be times when Cutler, 34, will look like Jeff George, the talented but mercurial former quarterback to whom he is often compared. We've already seen flashes of both in practice. For example, Cutler threw two interceptions in training camp on Saturday but had perhaps his most impressive practice since joining the Dolphins on Monday, with several \"wow\" throws to receivers Jarvis Landry and DeVante Parker.\n\nThese unpredictable swings could happen game to game and maybe even quarter to quarter. Being wildly inconsistent is the reason Cutler is 68-71 in his career as a starter, despite gaudy statistics that include more than 32,000 passing yards.\n\nFor Dolphins fans, be ready to hear the terms \"good Cutler\" and \"bad Cutler.\" It is the job of head coach Adam Gase to get more of the former and less of the latter out of his new quarterback.\n\nGase has done it once already, when he spent 2015 as offensive coordinator for the Chicago Bears. But let's not get too excited about a small sample size of his work with Cutler, who has been in the NFL for 11 years. Upon closer examination, a case can be made that Cutler's season with Gase, though impressive by some measures, wasn't all that great compared to the success of top-flight quarterbacks.\n\nAccording to ESPN Stats and Information, Cutler had a career-best 1.91 touchdown-to-interception ratio for the Bears in 2015. However, Cutler ranked 20th in the NFL and was 6-9 as a starter. His completion percentage (64.4) also was in the middle of the pack at 14th.\n\nThe Dolphins will be better off playing it safe with Cutler, who is the only quarterback in the league since 2006 to have a touchdown-to-interception ratio below 2.0 in all 11 seasons. That was something Gase improved in Cutler, who has 37 multi-interception games.

(AP) - Jay Cutler ran onto the field with the Miami Dolphins for the first time, and the fans greeted their new quarterback with a loud ovation.\n\nThey didn't have much else to cheer about over the next three hours.\n\nRyan Mallett threw for 113 yards and a touchdown, Josh Woodrum ran for two more scores and the Baltimore Ravens beat the Dolphins 31-7 on Thursday night in the second preseason game for both teams.\n\nCutler played the first two series for the Dolphins, his debut as injured starter Ryan Tannehill's replacement in Miami. He was 3 of 6 for 24 yards, some of it in a no-huddle tempo, and his highlight play was one that didn't count. Facing a third-and-16, Cutler stepped up and found DeVante Parker for what would have been a 31-yard gain - one erased by a holding flag.\n\n\"He was good. We kind of got the tempo going and got comfortable,\" Dolphins coach Adam Gase said. \"He had a couple really nice moves in the pocket, pushing up and making a couple guys miss. We had penalties on the play, so it was negated, but he felt good.\"\n\nCutler took a big hit on his last snap, courtesy of the Ravens' Za'Darius Smith. He got up without any problem, then switched his helmet for a baseball cap and headset.\n\n\"He's having fun,\" Gase said.\n\nRavens starting quarterback Joe Flacco isn't expected to play until Week 1 of the regular season because of back woes, and Mallett played the entire first half.\n\nMallett completed 13 of 22 passes, getting intercepted twice - both on passes intended for Quincy Adeboyejo. The first pick was by Xavier Howard on a ball lofted down the left sideline and overthrow, the other coming when Cordrea Tankersley ripped the ball out of Adeboyejo's hands after he had to reach back to make a catch on a quick slant.\n\nWoodrum completed eight of 10 passes for 110 yards.\n\nThe Dolphins' storyline coming into Thursday was all about Cutler, and his first game action with Miami. For as much hubbub as there was for that, there likely was as much concern about special teams when the night ended.\n\nSenorise Perry had an 11-yard touchdown run for Miami, but he also fumbled away a kickoff return - one of many Miami special-teams miscues. The Dolphins also had a punt blocked in the second quarter, setting up Mallett's 1-yard touchdown toss to Larry Donnell, and later had a hold on a kickoff return.\n\nGase said Miami had 10 men on the field for the blocked punt.\n\n\"It's one of those unforced errors we can't have happen,\" Gase said.\n\nTUCKER AUTOMATIC\n\nRavens kicker Justin Tucker is automatic from 50 yards or more.\n\nTucker connected on a 52-yarder for the Ravens' first points of the night. He also made a 59-yarder in Baltimore's preseason-opening win over Washington, and was 10 for 10 on tries from 50 yards or more last season.\n\nTucker also recovered a fumble on a misplayed kickoff return, one of Miami's many special-teams issues.\n\nQB WATCH\n\nDolphins backup Matt Moore, like Cutler, was also done for the night by the time the first quarter was over. He completed 3 of 5 passes for 11 yards, before getting relieved by David Fales. Brandon Doughty came in for Miami in the second half.\n\nCOMING HOME\n\nBaltimore's third quarterback, Thaddeus Lewis, was enjoying a homecoming. He played his high school ball at nearby Hialeah-Miami Lakes High.\n\nTOUGH START\n\nDolphins offensive lineman Sam Young was flagged for holding on consecutive plays in the first quarter, including one that wiped out the Cutler-to-Parker play for 31 yards.\n\nMORE OF THE SAME\n\nThe Ravens and Dolphins last met in December, with Baltimore winning that matchup 38-6. Baltimore is 25-9 in its last 34 preseason games.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

He retired over the offseason, then came back when the Miami Dolphins needed a quarterback. He missed last week's preseason opener because he had only been practicing a couple days, but that's about it. Cutler will be back on the field Thursday night, as he makes his Dolphins debut at home against the Baltimore Ravens.\n\n[Check out our five players to watch for the second week of NFL preseason action.]\n\nThere has been a lot of optimism about Cutler, who hasn't made a Pro Bowl since 2008 and whose only career playoff appearance was 2010, and now the Dolphins get a first look on how he might fit in.\n\n[Now's the time to sign up for Fantasy Football! Join for free]\n\nCutler was needed after quarterback Ryan Tannehill aggravated his ACL injury, knocking him out for the season. That's one of a few key injuries the Dolphins have dealt with this preseason. Cutler brings with him a big arm and a comfort level with Dolphins coach Adam Gase's offense. Gase was Cutler's offensive coordinator with the Chicago Bears in 2015. But we also remember Cutler's inconsistency and the turnovers, which were good reasons Cutler never made a Pro Bowl in his eight Bears seasons. There is also the injury risk. Cutler hasn't played all 16 games in a season since 2009. Spending a few months in retirement preparing for a job announcing games on Fox probably doesn't lessen that risk.\n\nWhile Cutler knows most of Gase's offense, he needs time to get acclimated to his Dolphins teammates. He didn't have OTA practices or the first part of training camp to do that. So the preseason, starting with his debut tonight, will be a little more important to Cutler and the Dolphins offensive players than it is for most teams. Dolphins fans just want some positive news to come out of this preseason.\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nFrank Schwab is the editor of Shutdown Corner on Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?

Parker is a freaky Demaryius Thomas-Alshon Jeffery type receiver, and he may quickly emerge as Cutler's favorite threat.\n\nOn a completion of 31 yards negated by a holding penalty on Sam Young, Cutler avoided pressure from the right side, stepped up into the pocket, kept his eyes downfield and overcame a lack of balance to strike Parker on the right sideline.\n\nOn Miami's second drive, Cutler showed off his arm talent.\n\nYes, Cutler can still sling it with the best of NFL quarterbacks.\n\nThere was a laser across the middle from Cutler to Parker, good for 16 yards.\n\nIt seemed to take Tannehill more than a year to develop a level of trust for Parker.\n\nIt seems to be in Cutler's nature (or perhaps its pure necessity) to trust a receiver like Parker -- immediately.\n\nDraped by two defensive backs on Thursday night, Cutler put one up for Parker (off his back foot, but these things happen) that failed to connect.\n\nBut that Cutler attempted the pass is an indication of what is likely to come.\n\nCutler is playing with house money. As much as Gase may encourage him to reel it in, to make good decisions, to play it smart, Cutler is Cutler is Cutler.\n\nHe's gonna do Jay.\n\nCutler's second drive ended when he was slammed hard to the turf after an incomplete screen attempt underneath. Cutler was forced to throw it away and he wasn't happy.\n\nAfter he came to Miami's sideline, Cutler approached the offensive line group and appeared to have some emotional words. It's hard to know if they were critical or encouraging; inspiring or challenging.\n\nBut the read here will be that it is a positive.\n\nFirst preseason opportunity or not, offensive linemen he can identify by full name or not, Cutler obviously feels comfortable enough to demand something of his teammates.\n\nAlso, emotion?\n\nIt's an indication Cutler cares. And for him to reach his ceiling of success, Cutler must care greatly this season.\n\nIt's unfair to draw vast conclusions based on two series in a preseason game (though of course, we'll try).\n\nIt's impossible to know exactly how much of Gase's offense Cutler has already mastered.\n\nIt's impossible to know exactly how long it will take Cutler to develop needed timing and chemistry with Jarvis Landry and Kenny Stills and Julius Thomas (as it hasn't been seen just yet, in camp).\n\nBut there were a few positive signs on Thursday night.\n\nReasons to believe that perhaps Cutler can help fill the void of Tannehill.\n\nReasons to believe that this unexpected experiment is not going to be an immediate train wreck.\n\nGase trusts his defensive coordinators (Vance Joseph last season and Matt Burke this season) to handle their side of the ball. He has his hands full calling plays (and now, a talented but aging quarterback thrown into deep waters).\n\nAnd so it would be wrong to suggest that Gase had never spent time engaging Tannehill, or Matt Moore, in between Miami series' or even while the Dolphins defense was in action.\n\nBut it was clear to anybody watching at Hard Rock Stadium on this night, in Gase's mind, the most important thing he needed to do was help get Cutler right.\n\nWhich Miami Dolphins are being held out vs. Baltimore Ravens?\n\n5 Things Miami Dolphins hope Jay Cutler shows tonight\n\n3 Concerning Miami Dolphins position groups in second preseason game\n\nESPN: Only 7 teams worse than Miami Dolphins", "id": "9828770", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Miami Dolphins: Jay Cutler, Adam Gase attached at the hip | The Daily Dolphin", "image": "https://cmgpbpdailydolphin.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/20170817-ale-dolphins-ravens-002-1.jpg?w=640", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "182034", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Miami Gardens"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "182037", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Gardens,_Florida", "label": {"eng": "Miami Gardens"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "id": "305661", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "id": "305872", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback"}, {"label": {"eng": "Guard (American and Canadian football)"}, "id": "322621", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(American_and_Canadian_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fumble"}, "id": "324226", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble"}, {"label": {"eng": "Offensive line"}, "id": "324464", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_line"}, {"label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}, "id": "331328", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins"}, {"label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}, "id": "335402", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adam Gase"}, "id": "341272", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Gase"}, {"label": {"eng": "Demaryius Thomas"}, "id": "352640", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demaryius_Thomas"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jay Cutler (American football)"}, "id": "355416", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Cutler_(American_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alshon Jeffery"}, "id": "361975", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alshon_Jeffery"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ryan Tannehill"}, "id": "364505", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Tannehill"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mike Pouncey"}, "id": "420397", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pouncey"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kenny Stills"}, "id": "435902", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Stills"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kraig Urbik"}, "id": "556258", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraig_Urbik"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jarvis Landry"}, "id": "1273951", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarvis_Landry"}, {"label": {"eng": "DeVante Parker"}, "id": "1275204", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeVante_Parker"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ja'Wuan James"}, "id": "1286067", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ja'Wuan_James"}], "location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Miami Gardens"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 9, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 93, "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora and Fauna", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora_and_Fauna"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 319, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 704, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel"}], "time": "23:14:00"}

He was intercepted twice (although one was the result of a pass being ripped away from receiver Quincy Adeboyejo) and would've been picked off a third time had Dolphins defensive lineman Jordan Phillips held onto the ball.\n\n\"I thought he did good,\" coach John Harbaugh said. \"He got out of trouble a few times and made a few throws. We'll just keep working to build off that. He was under pressure quite a bit early on, and I thought he handed it well and didn't make mistakes -- and that's really important -- and played good, solid football. We're not totally together up front [on the offensive line] right now, and I think he's doing OK given the circumstances.\"\n\nMallett's biggest problems are putting touch on throws and stringing good passes together. On some plays, he steps up in the pocket to convert a third down with a pass to tight end Benjamin Watson and rolls out to find Mike Wallace downfield. Then, there are the times when he throws over the head of Danny Woodhead on a simple screen pass and overthrows Adeboyejo for an interception.\n\nEven his throw to a wide-open Larry Donnell wasn't easy. Donnell had to go to the ground to catch the 1-yard touchdown.\n\nThe Ravens (2-0) indicated last week that the plan is for Flacco to start the regular season after not playing in the preseason.\n\nQB depth chart: Mallett struggles to push the ball downfield. He finished 13-of-22 for 113 yards. Mallett's passer rating was 50.0. ... Josh Woodrum was surprisingly impressive again. The first-year player out of Liberty completed 8 of 10 passes for 110 yards in addition to running for two touchdowns (14 yards, 1 yard).\n\nWhen it was starters vs. starters, the Ravens looked ...: Strong on defense. The first-team defense held the Dolphins to 44 yards in three drives. Baltimore limited Miami's top unit to nine yards rushing and stopped the Dolphins on three of four third downs. Offensively, the Ravens are, well, a work in progress without Flacco. Terrance West didn't have any room to run and totaled minus-2yards on six carries. Javorius Allen showed some burst, with 40 yards on 10 attempts.\n\nOne reason to be concerned: The offensive line. This makeshift group got pushed around up front, and there's a good reason why. Baltimore was without three injured starters: left tackle Ronnie Stanley, left guard Alex Lewis (out for the season) and Pro Bowl right guard Marshal Yanda (offseason shoulder surgery). The Ravens are so thin they started third-teamer Jarrod Pughsley at right guard.\n\nTucker time: In a span of six plays, Ravens kicker Justin Tucker kicked a 52-yard field goal, recovered a fumble on a kickoff return and then hit a 27-yard field goal. Just when you don't think the first-team All-Pro kicker can do anymore, he comes up with another play that reminds you why he was the Ravens' MVP last season. Tucker lobbied to try a 71-yard field goal at the end of the first half, but the Ravens didn't give him a chance.\n\nBiggest surprise:: The second preseason game was the best that Ravens tight end Maxx Williams looked all summer. The former second-round pick made two catches for 48 yards, and he showed some elusiveness on that 40-yard reception. In training camp, he never appeared to be 100 percent after coming back from a knee injury.\n\nDefensive lineman plays fullback: How confident are the Ravens in their current fullbacks? Baltimore used defensive lineman Patrick Ricard as a lead blocker in the first half. The undrafted rookie out of Maine was already making a push for the roster for his aggressive play on the defensive line. Lorenzo Taliaferro and Ricky Ortiz haven't stood out at fullback.\n\nQuiet debut for first-rounder: Cornerback Marlon Humphrey didn't make a tackle or break up a pass in limited action. The No. 16 overall pick didn't play in Thursday's second half.", "id": "9816562", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Ravens' Ryan Mallett continues shaky summer with two INTs (and nearly

On a fourth-and-2 from the Miami Dolphins' 41-yard line, Ravens coach John Harbaugh called a timeout.\n\nOnce play resumed, the Ravens came out in a spread offense and quarterback Ryan Mallett threw a 1-yard pass to running back Danny Woodhead across the middle that was knocked down by linebacker Mike Hull. Even if he had caught the ball, Woodhead would've been short of a first down.\n\nAnd that's the best the Ravens could come up with: a 1-yard clearing out pattern.\n\nIt's preseason and it would be unfair to be overly concerned at this point, but where is the intermediate- to long- range passing game in the Ravens offense? Two preseason games have been played and the 2017 Ravens offense looks a lot like the 2016 version.\n\nThat's not good enough.\n\nInstead of Joe Flacco throwing to tight end Dennis Pitta and fullback Kyle Juszczyk on short pass patterns, it is Mallett throwing to receiver Michael Campanaro or Woodhead. The Ravens run the West Coast offense, which is predicated on short passes and those quick hitters are supposed to be as effective as running plays.\n\nBut it hasn't worked for the Ravens since Gary Kubiak vacated the offensive coordinator position and became head coach of the Denver Broncos in 2015.\n\nThe Ravens were without Flacco, their starter, on Thursday night and he certainly has a stronger arm and more command of the offense than Mallett, But the Ravens' starting unit only challenged Miami downfield once in the first half, and that pass was intercepted as Mallett tried to throw down the left sideline to rookie receiver Quincy Adeboyejo.\n\nDuring the offseason, the Ravens stressed they wanted to get another big-play receiver in the offense after the retirement of Steve Smith Sr, and they went out and signed former Kansas City Chiefs receiver Jeremy Maclin. But Maclin has done nothing in the preseason games and hasn't been a big playmaker in practices during training camp.\n\nVeteran Mike Wallace, possibly the fastest receiver on the team, was used mostly on hitches and quick turnarounds against the Dolphins. It's preseason, and of course head coaches will say they don't want to show too much.\n\nUnfortunately for the Ravens, we've heard this story and seen the offense too many times throughout the years. The Ravens can't use the excuse that they don't have speed because they have a lot of it.\n\nWallace is a burner and so is Breshad Perriman, when he steps on the field. Tight end Larry Donnell has shown the ability to stretch defenses down the middle of the field as well during training camp.\n\nBut the speed hasn't been on display. The Ravens are going to need those big plays this season. They have yet to play a regular-season game, but they have a patchwork offensive line that will probably struggle all season. They have adequate but not spectacular running backs, and Flacco is coming off a poor showing from last season.\n\nThe Ravens' philosophy of trying to establish a strong running game this year is understandable. They should have one of the best defenses in the NFL and that unit will keep them in almost every game this season.\n\nBut they are still going to have to manufacture points and a couple of big plays will be needed. Those days of three or four 70- to 80-yard drives a game are gone. It might be preseason and a time not to show too much, but it's also a time to work on things like pushing the ball downfield more.\n\nEventually, they are going to have to do that to win a few games.\n\nmike.preston@baltsun.com\n\ntwitter.com/MikePrestonSun", "id": "9804090", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Preston: Ravens' first-team offense again doesn't work in preseason

But Cutler completed a 16-yard pass to Parker over the middle.\n\nCutler, signed Aug. 7 to take over for Ryan Tannehill, who sustained a season-ending knee injury on Aug. 3, ended 3-for-6 passing for 24 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in two possessions totaling nine official snaps (not including penalties).\n\nHe even took a hit on his surgically-repaired right (throwing) shoulder.\n\n\"I went over to talk to the doctors and I said, 'I think I'm good to go,' \" said Cutler, who had surgery to repair his labrum in December. \"I was kind of glad to get that one out of the way, landed right on my right shoulder, didn't feel anything. So Dr. [Mark] Bowen in Chicago, nice job.\"\n\nAjayi, who got out of the NFL's concussion protocol Tuesday, flashed the same head-banging style he used to rumble for 1,272 yards and a Pro Bowl berth last season. He caught a short pass from Cutler and bulled his way to an 11-yard gain. That was after having a 19-yard gain wiped out due to offsetting penalties (Young was called for holding and Baltimore's Eric Weddle was called for unnecessary roughness).\n\nGase said the decision to play Ajayi was simple.\n\n\"I thought he did good,\" Gase said. \"It's preseason. You've got to play. It's part of the process.\"\n\nGase added he doesn't feel the need to rush the bonding between Cutler and the team.\n\n\"It'll kind of come naturally for us,\" he said. \"I've got a pretty good feel how to call plays for him. He's really honest with me as far as what he's feeling and how he's seeing things.\n\n\"I feel really good where we're at right now. This next week will be really good for us because going against another team and then playing that third preseason game, we'll keep trying to improve and kind of get in that game flow. I like what I saw tonight and I'm ready to get this going next week.\"\n\nBeyond Cutler and Ajayi, results were mixed for the Dolphins.\n\nParker (one reception, 16 yards) was active, as was left guard Jesse Davis, the first-year player from Idaho. The latter might not be a big deal but it could help shore up the position that lost projected starter Ted Larsen (biceps).\n\nCornerbacks Byron Maxwell (two fumbles caused), Xavien Howard (interception) and Cordrea Tankersley, the rookie third-round pick from Clemson, were fairly disruptive.\n\nAnd middle linebacker Mike Hull had five first-half tackles, including one tackle for loss, and a pass defended as he tries to battle for the starting job vacated by rookie Raekwon McMillan, injured last week against Atlanta.\n\nBut penalties (seven for 51 yards in the first half alone) and special teams miscues -- a lost fumble and blocked punt led to 10 first-half points for Baltimore and a 13-7 Ravens halftime lead -- were major problems.\n\nBaltimore, perhaps the only team that can rival the Dolphins when it comes to injuries, didn't play quarterback Joe Flacco (back), right guard Marshal Yanda, wide receiver Breshad Perriman (hamstring) or left tackle Ronnie Stanley, among others.\n\nBut the Ravens, known for their physical playing style and aggressive disposition, managed to put together enough of an effort to make life rough for the Dolphins. Heck, kicker Justin Tucker made life rough on the Dolphins. During one second-quarter stretch the All-Pro kicker booted a 52-yard field goal, recovered a fumble on a kickoff, and kicked a 27-yard field goal to cut Baltimore's deficit to 7-6.\n\nRegardless, the Dolphins had enough positive plays to offer a bit of optimism as they head into next week's crucial game at Philadelphia, the third preseason game in the four-game exhibition season.\n\nThere were apparently no new significant injuries and the principle offensive weapons -- Cutler, Ajayi, Parker, fellow wide receivers Jarvis Landry and Kenny Stills, and center Mike Pouncey -- should all be on the field next week.\n\nDefensively, things could have been better. Baltimore had 113 yards rushing on 28 carries entering the fourth quarter, but not much of that was gained on the first unit, which played three series. And the Dolphins' first-team defense is relatively healthy, an encouraging sign for next week.\n\nThe Dolphins won't practice (although they might have walk-through sessions) Friday or Saturday. They'll travel to Philadelphia on Sunday, practice against the Eagles on Monday and Tuesday, and play at Philadelphia on Thursday.\n\nCutler said the experience should be fruitful. And he added he's not making judgments on the offense yet.\n\n\"I don't think we're into gauging where we're at,\" he said. \"We're just trying to get better each outing.\n\n\"With the first group we got a couple of penalties there that kind of took some momentum away, a few mistakes here and there. We'll take a look at it tomorrow. We get a really good opportunity. We're going to Philly, practicing against them a couple of days, and then we get to suit it up one more time.\"\n\nchperkins@sunsentinel.com; On Twitter @Chrisperk", "id": "9862605", "details": {},

Ryan Mallett threw for 113 yards and a touchdown , Josh Woodrum ran for two more scores and the Baltimore Ravens beat the Dolphins 31-7 on Thursday night in the second preseason game for both teams.\n\nMiami Dolphins quarterback Jay Cutler (6), looks to pass the ball, during the first half of an NFL preseason football game against the Baltimore Ravens, Thursday, Aug. 17, 2017, in Miami Gardens, Fla. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)\n\n\"Dr. Bowen in Chicago, nice job,\" Cutler said, with a thumbs-up for emphasis.\n\nCutler played the first two series for the Dolphins, his debut as injured starter Ryan Tannehill's replacement in Miami. He was 3 of 6 for 24 yards , some of it in a no-huddle tempo, and his highlight play was one that didn't count. Facing a third-and-16, Cutler stepped up and found DeVante Parker for what would have been a 31-yard gain - one erased by a holding flag.\n\n\"Thought he was good,\" said Dolphins coach Adam Gase, who also coached Cutler in Chicago. \"First time out. Looks like we really weren't apart for a year. His tempo was really good.\"\n\nCutler took a big hit on his last snap, courtesy of the Ravens' Za'Darius Smith. He got up without any problem, then switched his helmet for a baseball cap and headset.\n\n\"I was kind of glad to get that one out of the way,\" Cutler said.\n\nRavens starting quarterback Joe Flacco isn't expected to play until Week 1 of the regular season because of back woes, and Mallett played the entire first half.\n\n\"I thought he did good,\" Ravens coach John Harbaugh said. \"He got out of trouble a few times. He made a few throws.\"\n\nMallett completed 13 of 22 passes, getting intercepted twice - both on passes intended for Quincy Adeboyejo. The first pick was by Xavier Howard on a ball lofted down the left sideline and overthrow, the other coming when Cordrea Tankersley ripped the ball out of Adeboyejo's hands after he had to reach back to make a catch on a quick slant.\n\n\"I think I played better,\" Mallett said. \"There's still plays to be made.\"\n\nWoodrum completed eight of 10 passes for 110 yards.\n\n\"He's got some poise, he can play the game,\" Harbaugh said.\n\nSenorise Perry had an 11-yard touchdown run for Miami, but he also fumbled away a kickoff return - one of many Miami special-teams miscues. The Dolphins also had a punt blocked in the second quarter, setting up Mallett's 1-yard touchdown toss to Larry Donnell, and later had a hold on a kickoff return.\n\nGase said Miami had 10 men on the field for the blocked punt.\n\n\"It's one of those unforced errors we can't have happen,\" Gase said.\n\nTUCKER AUTOMATIC\n\nRavens kicker Justin Tucker is automatic from 50 yards or more.\n\nTucker connected on a 52-yarder for the Ravens' first points of the night. He also made a 59-yarder in Baltimore's preseason-opening win over Washington, and was 10 for 10 on tries from 50 yards or more last season.\n\nTucker also recovered a fumble on a misplayed kickoff return, one of Miami's many special-teams issues. But Tucker also tried to scoop-and-score the fumble recovery, drawing serious ire from Terrell Suggs and others on the Ravens sideline.\n\n\"Suggs was about to strangle him when he came off,\" Harbaugh said.\n\nSaid Tucker: \"Obviously, I'm better with my feet than my hands.\"\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nBaltimore Ravens wide receiver Chris Matthews (13) blocks a punt by Miami Dolphins punter Matt Darr (4), during the first half of an NFL preseason football game, Thursday, Aug. 17, 2017, in Miami Gardens, Fla.

(AP) -- Jay Cutler ran onto the field with the Miami Dolphins for the first time, and the fans greeted their new quarterback with a loud ovation.\n\nThey didn't have much else to cheer about over the next three hours.\n\nRyan Mallett threw for 113 yards and a touchdown, Josh Woodrum ran for two more scores and the Baltimore Ravens beat the Dolphins 31-7 on Thursday night in the second preseason game for both teams.\n\nCutler played the first two series for the Dolphins, his debut as injured starter Ryan Tannehill's replacement in Miami. He was 3 of 6 for 24 yards, some of it in a no-huddle tempo, and his highlight play was one that didn't count. Facing a third-and-16, Cutler stepped up and found DeVante Parker for what would have been a 31-yard gain -- one erased by a holding flag.\n\n\"He was good. We kind of got the tempo going and got comfortable,\" Dolphins coach Adam Gase said. \"He had a couple really nice moves in the pocket, pushing up and making a couple guys miss. We had penalties on the play, so it was negated, but he felt good.\"\n\nCutler took a big hit on his last snap, courtesy of the Ravens' Za'Darius Smith. He got up without any problem, then switched his helmet for a baseball cap and headset.\n\n\"He's having fun,\" Gase said.\n\nRavens starting quarterback Joe Flacco isn't expected to play until Week 1 of the regular season because of back woes, and Mallett played the entire first half.\n\nMallett completed 13 of 22 passes, getting intercepted twice -- both on passes intended for Quincy Adeboyejo. The first pick was by Xavier Howard on a ball lofted down the left sideline and overthrow, the other coming when Cordrea Tankersley ripped the ball out of Adeboyejo's hands after he had to reach back to make a catch on a quick slant.\n\nWoodrum completed eight of 10 passes for 110 yards.\n\nThe Dolphins' storyline coming into Thursday was all about Cutler, and his first game action with Miami. For as much hubbub as there was for that, there likely was as much concern about special teams when the night ended.\n\nSenorise Perry had an 11-yard touchdown run for Miami, but he also fumbled away a kickoff return -- one of many Miami special-teams miscues. The Dolphins also had a punt blocked in the second quarter, setting up Mallett's 1-yard touchdown toss to Larry Donnell, and later had a hold on a kickoff return.\n\nGase said Miami had 10 men on the field for the blocked punt.\n\n\"It's one of those unforced errors we can't have happen,\" Gase said.\n\nTUCKER AUTOMATIC\n\nRavens kicker Justin Tucker is automatic from 50 yards or more.\n\nTucker connected on a 52-yarder for the Ravens' first points of the night. He also made a 59-yarder in Baltimore's preseason-opening win over Washington, and was 10 for 10 on tries from 50 yards or more last season.\n\nTucker also recovered a fumble on a misplayed kickoff return, one of Miami's many special-teams issues.\n\nQB WATCH\n\nDolphins backup Matt Moore, like Cutler, was also done for the night by the time the first quarter was over. He completed 3 of 5 passes for 11 yards, before getting relieved by David Fales. Brandon Doughty came in for Miami in the second half.\n\nCOMING HOME\n\nBaltimore's third quarterback, Thaddeus Lewis, was enjoying a homecoming. He played his high school ball at nearby Hialeah-Miami Lakes High.\n\nTOUGH START\n\nDolphins offensive lineman Sam Young was flagged for holding on consecutive plays in the first quarter, including one that wiped out the Cutler-to-Parker play for 31 yards.\n\nMORE OF THE SAME\n\nThe Ravens and Dolphins last met in December, with Baltimore winning that matchup 38-6. Baltimore is 25-9 in its last 34 preseason games.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

He was intercepted twice (although one was the result of a pass being ripped away from receiver Quincy Adeboyejo) and would've been picked off a third time if Dolphins defensive lineman Jordan Phillips held onto the ball.\n\nMallett's biggest problems are putting touch on throws and stringing good passes together. On some plays, he steps up in the pocket to convert a third down with a pass to tight end Benjamin Watson and rolls out to find Mike Wallace downfield. Then, there are the times when he throws over the head of Danny Woodhead on a simple screen pass and overthrows Adeboyejo for an interception.\n\nEven his throw to a wide-open Larry Donnell wasn't easy. Donnell had to go to the ground to catch the 1-yard touchdown.\n\nThe Ravens (2-0) indicated last week that the plan is for Flacco to start the regular season after not playing in the preseason.\n\nQB depth chart: Mallett struggles to push the ball downfield. He finished 13 of 22 for 113 yards. Mallett's passer rating was 50.0. ... Josh Woodrum was surprisingly impressive again. The first-year player out of Liberty completed 8 of 10 passes for 110 yards in addition to running for two touchdowns (14 yards, 1 yard).\n\nWhen it was starters vs. starters, the Ravens looked...: Strong on defense. The first-team defense held the Dolphins to 44 yards in three drives. Baltimore limited Miami's top unit to nine yards rushing and stopped the Dolphins on three of four third downs. Offensively, the Ravens are, well, a work in progress without Flacco. Terrance West didn't have any room to run and totaled minus-2yards on six carries. Javorius Allen showed some burst, with 40 yards on 10 attempts.\n\nOne reason to be concerned: The offensive line. This makeshift group got pushed around up front, and there's a good reason why. Baltimore was without three injured starters: left tackle Ronnie Stanley, left guard Alex Lewis (out for the season) and Pro Bowl right guard Marshal Yanda (offseason shoulder surgery). The Ravens are so thin they started third-teamer Jarrod Pughsley at right guard.\n\nTucker time: In a span of six plays, Ravens kicker Justin Tucker kicked a 52-yard field goal, recovered a fumble on a kickoff and then hit a 27-yard field goal. Just when you don't think the first-team All-Pro kicker can do anymore, he comes up with another play that reminds you why he was the Ravens' MVP last season. Tucker lobbied to try a 71-yard field goal at the end of the first half, but the Ravens didn't give him a chance.\n\nBiggest surprise:: The second preseason game was the best that Ravens tight end Maxx Williams looked all summer. The former second-round pick made two catches for 48 yards, and he showed some elusiveness on that 40-yard reception. In training camp, he never appeared to be 100 percent after coming back from a knee injury.\n\nDefensive lineman plays fullback: How confident are the Ravens in their current fullbacks? Baltimore used defensive lineman Patrick Ricard as a lead blocker in the first half. The undrafted rookie out of Maine was already making a push for the roster for his aggressive play on the defensive line. Lorenzo Taliaferro and Ricky Ortiz haven't stood out at fullback.\n\nQuiet debut for first-rounder: Cornerback Marlon Humphrey didn't make a tackle or break up a pass in limited action. The No. 16 overall pick didn't play in Thursday's second half.", "id": "9812660", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Ravens' Ryan Mallett continues shaky summer with two INTs (and nearly

However, the offensive line still bore little resemblance to the group the Ravens hope to put out on the field in their Sept. 10 regular-season opener against the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nWith left tackle Ronnie Stanley sidelined with an undisclosed injury, right guard Marshal Yanda being held out as he continues his recovery from offseason shoulder surgery and left guard Alex Lewis out for the season because of shoulder surgery, the Ravens were again forced to start a makeshift offensive line.\n\nJames Hurst, who started at right tackle against the Redskins, moved to left tackle in place of Stanley. Recently-signed Austin Howard occupied the right tackle spot. Ryan Jensen remained at center with Matt Skura starting at right guard and Jarrod Pughsley getting the assignment at left guard. Rookie fifth-round selection Jermaine Eluemunor started at left guard last week, but he missed some practice time this week with an undisclosed injury, so the Ravens went with Pughsley.\n\nOtherwise, running back Danny Woodhead, wide receivers Mike Wallace and Jeremy Maclin and tight end Benjamin Watson got their first preseason action after being held out last week.\n\nThe only other Ravens who weren't in uniform were quarterback Joe Flacco (back), wide receivers Breshad Perriman (hamstring), Kenny Bell (hamstring) and Tim White (thumb), linebacker Lamar Louis (undisclosed), and cornerbacks Maurice Canady (knee) and Brandon Boykin (undisclosed).\n\nFaith in Tucker: Ravens kicker Justin Tucker is a victim of his own success. Even his head coach, John Harbaugh, acknowledges that he's guilty of taking the league's all-time most accurate kicker for granted on occasion.\n\nTucker has been so good that it's newsworthy when he does miss, even if it's in practice. During training camp, Tucker has misfired on far more field-goal attempts than he has in previous summers. While just about all the misses have been from more than 40 yards, it's still jarring to see Tucker, who made 38 of his 39 attempts last year, miss multiple times in a practice, which has happened this summer.\n\n\"We treat practices very seriously -- just like for punters, kickers and all players who are practicing to get better. The results of Justin's training camp, I think, are positive,\" Ravens associate head coach and special teams coordinator Jerry Rosburg said earlier this week. \"We don't want to miss any kicks during training camp, just like we don't want to miss any kicks during the preseason games, nor do we want to miss any kicks during the regular season. But, it's a fact of life.\"\n\nRosburg said that the kicking battery of Tucker, holder Sam Koch and long snapper Morgan Cox has been working hard to regain the timing that they had last year.\n\n\"I have a lot of confidence in all three of those guys, particularly in Justin,\" Rosburg said. \"He has an excellent track record. We're happy we have him, and we trust him.\"\n\nTucker bounced a 43-yard field-goal attempt off the left upright in the preseason opener, but a penalty against the Redskins nullified the miss. He rebounded to make field goals of 37, 59 and 21 yards while also converting on both of his extra-point tries.\n\nThe first of two: By year's end, the Ravens and Dolphins should know each other pretty well. Thursday night's preseason matchup is the first two of two meetings between the teams, a relatively rare occurrence. The Dolphins will travel to Baltimore to face the Ravens on Oct. 26 in Week 8 of the regular season.\n\nIt marks the 11th time in franchise history the Ravens are scheduled to play a team in both the preseason and the regular season. The last time it happened was in 2014 with the New Orleans Saints. This year also is the fifth straight in which the Ravens and Dolphins will meet in the regular season.\n\nEnd zone: There were no developments on the Jeremy Zuttah front as the free-agent center is still pondering signing with the Ravens or Indianapolis Colts. Colts head coach Chuck Pagano announced Thursday that his starting center, Ryan Kelly, will need foot surgery and could miss some time during the regular season. ... Ravens safety Tony Jefferson and Dolphins wide receiver Kenny Stills caught up before the game. The two were former roommates at Oklahoma. ... CBS announced the broadcasting crews earlier this week for the Ravens' first three games. Spero Dedes and Adam Archuleta will be on the call for the regular-season opener against the Bengals; Andrew Catalon and James Lofton have the Week 2 matchup with the Cleveland Browns and the Week 3 game against the Jacksonville Jaguars in London.; and Ian Eagle and Dan Fouts will broadcast the Ravens' Week 4 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\njeff.zrebiec@baltsun.com\n\ntwitter.com/jeffzrebiecsun", "id": "9795725", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Ravens notes: Several vets return, but team forced to start

Baltimore will use more offensive skills players than it did in the first preseason game.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Ravens and Dolphins have never met in the preseason before. The regular-season series is tied, 6-6, with the Ravens winning last year in Baltimore, 38-6. The Ravens will host the Dolphins in Week 8 of the regular season.\n\nKey Storylines\n\nMore Offensive Weapons for Mallett\n\nThe first-team offense struggled under backup quarterback Ryan Mallett in the preseason opener. Head Coach John Harbaugh was happy that the unit played winning football, but he was clear this week that he wants to see more points. Mallett should have more weapons around him this time at wide receiver (Mike Wallace, Jeremy Maclin) and running back (Danny Woodhead), so it will be interesting to see if he has more success.\n\nOffensive Line Is Still Fluid\n\nWhile Mallett has more skill-position players around him, he still has issues in front of him. Left tackle Ronnie Stanley is nursing an injury and is unlikely to play. That means James Hurst will either step in at left tackle or at left guard after Alex Lewis' season-ending shoulder surgery. Austin Howard should make his Ravens game debut at right tackle. This is a chance to evaluate Baltimore's depth and see if players can build momentum and chemistry together.\n\nDefensive Repeat?\n\nThe Ravens' first-team defense shredded the Redskins, leaving them with minus-3 yards on the evening. Next up is the debut of newly-signed Dolphins quarterback Jay Cutler, who is stepping in for injured Ryan Tannehill (knee). Baltimore is looking for more of the same - or perhaps even some turnovers from the starting unit. They stressed this week that there is still room for improvement.\n\nPlayers to Watch\n\nQB Ryan Mallett\n\nFor the second-straight week, Mallett will be under the microscope. Joe Flacco won't play at all this preseason because of his back injury, and the Ravens want to feel like the offense is in good hands if Mallett were needed to play in the regular season. He can play at a high level, but Mallett needs to cut down on the off-target throws he had against Washington.\n\nOL James Hurst\n\nIt appears that Hurst will be thrust back into the starting lineup because of Lewis' injury, which opens a spot at left guard. Hurst may need to fill in at left tackle against the Dolphins with Stanley out, but the Ravens could also opt to have him get more comfortable inside as a trial. Either way, Hurst wants to prove that he can be trusted as one of the Ravens' top five linemen.\n\nCB Marlon Humphrey\n\nHumphrey should make his NFL debut after missing the first preseason game because of injury. The Ravens' first-round pick has been extremely impressive in practice, and now it's his chance to transfer that to the game. Harbaugh has said that Humphrey is challenging for a starting position. How will he fare against the Dolphins' talented trio of receivers in Jarvis Landry, Kenny Stills and DeVante Parker?", "id": "9806705", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Ravens vs.

This year if the fish want to continue to repeat their regular season success, they need to continue to focus on their defense. The Dolphins starting defense looks great and Thursday's game was no different. Although, Miami lost the exhibition game to the Baltimore Ravens 31-7 inside of Sun Life Stadium.\n\nThe starting defense did a phenomenal job stopping the Ravens and a large credit goes to the pressure of the defensive line. Due to the continuous pressure, Ravens starting quarterback Ryan Mallett never looked comfortable. On one of the rare plays where he did have a few seconds to throw, Mallett threw up a beautiful football in the air, only to fall into the hands of Dolphins cornerback Xavien Howard.\n\n\"I guess they were trying to see if their receiver could make a play and I ended up making a play. I just saw the ball in the air and I took it\" said Howard.\n\nMallett also missed out on a few red zone opportunities including an errant pass which almost lead to his second interception. Nevertheless, the Ravens had to settle for a field goal even with their next to perfect field position. Mallett shortly later would redeem himself accounting for a one-yard touchdown pass from a Dolphins gaffe on offense which gave Baltimore another red zone possession.\n\nStill, Mallett finished the game going a very tough 13-for-22 for 113 yards, a touchdown, and two interceptions. However, Mallett wasn't the only problem for Baltimore's offense. Miami's defense also forced two fumbles during the night which were drive killers for the Ravens.\n\n\"It was great to see the sudden change, guys stepping up and holding them to the field goal. The turnover was great and getting balls on the ground, that's what we've been talking about. Let's get it out and see if we can get it back\" said head coach Adam Gase.\n\nFor as great as the defense did play, the only thing that's still missing for the Dolphins is a quarterback. People didn't know how to respond to the signing of Jay Cutler. There was a lot of anticipation in the building for how Cutler would play after being out for so long. Regardless of your belief or disbelief, the Cutler era in Miami has officially started and it wasn't terrible.\n\nAlthough we only got to see a little glimpse, how much did we expect someone who prepared for retirement little less than two months ago?\n\nGoing into Thursday's preseason game Dolphins head coach Adam Gase seemed confident in his hand picked quarterback.\n\n\"He's pretty much got the offense down, it's just more about timing,\" said Gase. \"It's more mental, just kind of that feel of when to turn the ball loose, getting used to the receivers, the D-line rushing.\"\n\nCutler, this game was under fire from the Ravens, stood in the pocket and still made throws. It might be discouraging a bit for the offensive line to allow pressure. The good news is for Cutler who hasn't played in some time it served as a refresher. Cutler finished the contest going for 3-for-6 for 24 yards.\n\n\"He was good. We kind of got the tempo going and got comfortable. He had a couple really nice moves in the pocket, pushing up and making a couple guys miss. We had penalties on the play, so it was negated; but he felt good. He took a hit there on the screen. He's having fun\" said Gase.\n\nMiami will continue to play their hearts this preseason on the road as they play the Philadelphia Eagles on August 24, 2017, inside of the Lincoln Financial Field.

Jay Cutler's appearance was brief, but the 12-year veteran was able to show what he can do.\n\nIn two series of work during Miami's 31-7 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, Cutler had a couple of impressive throws. He connected with receiver DeVante Parker on a 16-yard timing route for a first down. They teamed up again on a 20-plus-yard gain that was called back due to a holding penalty, with Cutler showing good pocket presence to extend the play.\n\nOverall, Cutler was 3-of-6 passing for 24 yards. Both of his drives resulted in punts.\n\n\"He was good,\" Dolphins coach Adam Gase said at halftime. \"We kind of got the tempo going and got comfortable. He had a couple really nice moves in the pocket, pushing up and making a couple guys miss. We had penalties on the play, so it was negated. But he felt good. He took a hit there on the screen. He's having fun.\"\n\nQB depth chart: It was a short night for Miami's top two quarterbacks. Cutler and Matt Moore both played two series; Moore was 3-of-5 passing for 11 yards. The real competition is for Miami's No. 3 quarterback job between David Fales and Brandon Doughty. Neither quarterback did much to stand out.\n\nWhen it was starters vs. starters, the Dolphins looked ... average. Miami's first-team defense played well against the Ravens, who didn't have starting quarterback Joe Flacco due to injury. The Dolphins held Baltimore's Ryan Mallett-led offense scoreless in the first quarter, which included a fourth-down stop and interception by cornerback Xavien Howard. However, the Dolphins' first-team offense failed to capitalize and put points on the board. Cutler had a few highlight throws, but too many penalties kept Miami from moving the ball.\n\nOne reason to be concerned: The Dolphins' starting offensive line and key reserves had their worst performance of the preseason. There were three holding calls on the first two drives, and shaky pass blocking meant Cutler and Moore took one hard hit apiece in limited playing time. Miami's offensive line also struggled in training camp.\n\nThat guy could start: One week ago rookie middle linebacker Raekwon McMillan went down with a season-ending knee injury, which led to questions about who would fill in. Third-year veteran Mike Hull made a strong case with five tackles, one tackle for loss and a pass defensed. Hull stayed around the football and looked the part as a starter with the first-team defense.\n\nRookie watch: Dolphins first-round pick Charles Harris came to Miami with a reputation as a seasoned pass-rusher. But Harris still has work to do against the run, and that showed in the second preseason game. Harris failed to set the edge on at least two long runs by Baltimore in the first half. One play was called back due to a holding call. But these will be teaching moments on film that coaches can work on with Harris.\n\nAjayi gets work: Pro Bowl running back Jay Ajayi saw his first action of the preseason following his release from concussion protocol on Tuesday. Ajayi ran for minus-2 yards on two carries and caught one pass for 11 yards. But Ajayi's best play was a long draw on third down that was called back due to a holding call.\n\nMaxwell active: Dolphins No. 1 cornerback Byron Maxwell isn't known for his tackling, but he had two strong plays Thursday that nearly forced turnovers. Maxwell had two swipes that jarred the ball loose from Baltimore receiver Mike Wallace and running back Terrance West. However, the Ravens recovered both fumbles.", "id": "9816560", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Dolphins QB Jay Cutler shows flashes in brief debut", "image":

But Cutler completed a 16-yard pass to Parker over the middle.\n\nCutler, signed Aug. 7 to take over for Ryan Tannehill, who sustained a season-ending knee injury on Aug. 3, ended 3-for-6 passing for 24 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in two possessions totaling nine official snaps (not including penalties).\n\nAjayi, who got out of the NFL's concussion protocol Tuesday, flashed the same head-banging style he used to rumble for 1,272 yards and a Pro Bowl berth last season. He caught a short pass from Cutler and bulled his way to an 11-yard gain. That was after having a 19-yard gain wiped out due to offsetting penalties (Young was called for holding and Baltimore's Eric Weddle was called for unnecessary roughness).\n\nBeyond Cutler and Ajayi, results were mixed for the Dolphins.\n\nParker (one reception, 16 yards) was active, as was left guard Jesse Davis, the first-year player from Idaho. The latter might not be a big deal but it could help shore up the position that lost projected starter Ted Larsen (biceps).\n\nCornerbacks Byron Maxwell (two fumbles caused), Xavien Howard (interception) and Cordrea Tankersley, the rookie third-round pick from Clemson, were fairly disruptive.\n\nAnd middle linebacker Mike Hull had five first-half tackles, including one tackle for loss, and a pass defended as he tries to battle for the starting job vacated by rookie Raekwon McMillan, who injured his knee last week against Atlanta and is loss for the season.\n\nBut penalties (seven for 51 yards in the first half alone) and special teams miscues -- a lost fumble and blocked punt led to 10 first-half points for Baltimore and a 13-7 Ravens halftime lead -- were major problems.\n\nBaltimore, perhaps the only team that can rival the Dolphins when it comes to injuries, didn't play quarterback Joe Flacco (back), right guard Marshal Yanda, wide receiver Breshad Perriman (hamstring) or left tackle Ronnie Stanley, among others.\n\nBut the Ravens, known for their physical playing style and aggressive disposition, managed to put together enough of an effort to make life rough for the Dolphins. Heck, kicker Justin Tucker made life rough on the Dolphins. During one second-quarter stretch the All-Pro kicker booted a 52-yard field goal, recovered a fumble on a kickoff, and kicked a 27-yard field goal to cut Baltimore's deficit to 7-6.\n\nRegardless, the Dolphins had enough positive plays to offer a bit of optimism as they head into next week's crucial game at Philadelphia, the third preseason game in the four-game exhibition season.\n\nThere were apparently new significant injuries and the principle offensive weapons -- Cutler, Ajayi, Parker, fellow wide receivers Jarvis Landry and Kenny Stills, and center Mike Pouncey -- should all be on the field next week.\n\nDefensively, things could have been better. Baltimore had 113 yards rushing on 28 carries entering the fourth quarter, but not much of that was gained on the first unit, which played three series. And the Dolphins' first-team defense is relatively healthy, an encouraging sign for next week.\n\nThe Dolphins won't practice (although they might have walk-through sessions) Friday or Saturday. They'll travel to Philadelphia on Sunday, practice against the Eagles on Monday and Tuesday, and play at Philadelphia on Thursday.\n\nchperkins@sunsentinel.com; On Twitter @Chrisperk", "id":

(AP) Jay Cutler ran onto the field with the Miami Dolphins for the first time, and the fans greeted their new quarterback with a loud ovation.\n\nThey didn't have much else to cheer about over the next three hours.\n\nRyan Mallett threw for 113 yards and a touchdown, Josh Woodrum ran for two more scores and the Baltimore Ravens beat the Dolphins 31-7 on Thursday night in the second preseason game for both teams.\n\nCutler played the first two series for the Dolphins, his debut as injured starter Ryan Tannehill's replacement in Miami. He was 3 of 6 for 24 yards, some of it in a no-huddle tempo, and his highlight play was one that didn't count. Facing a third-and-16, Cutler stepped up and found DeVante Parker for what would have been a 31-yard gain - one erased by a holding flag.\n\n\"He was good. We kind of got the tempo going and got comfortable,\" Dolphins coach Adam Gase said. \"He had a couple really nice moves in the pocket, pushing up and making a couple guys miss. We had penalties on the play, so it was negated, but he felt good.\"\n\nCutler took a big hit on his last snap, courtesy of the Ravens' Za'Darius Smith. He got up without any problem, then switched his helmet for a baseball cap and headset.\n\n\"He's having fun,\" Gase said.\n\nRavens starting quarterback Joe Flacco isn't expected to play until Week 1 of the regular season because of back woes, and Mallett played the entire first half.\n\nMallett completed 13 of 22 passes, getting intercepted twice - both on passes intended for Quincy Adeboyejo. The first pick was by Xavier Howard on a ball lofted down the left sideline and overthrow, the other coming when Cordrea Tankersley ripped the ball out of Adeboyejo's hands after he had to reach back to make a catch on a quick slant.\n\nWoodrum completed eight of 10 passes for 110 yards.\n\nThe Dolphins' storyline coming into Thursday was all about Cutler, and his first game action with Miami. For as much hubbub as there was for that, there likely was as much concern about special teams when the night ended.\n\nSenorise Perry had an 11-yard touchdown run for Miami, but he also fumbled away a kickoff return - one of many Miami special-teams miscues. The Dolphins also had a punt blocked in the second quarter, setting up Mallett's 1-yard touchdown toss to Larry Donnell, and later had a hold on a kickoff return.\n\nGase said Miami had 10 men on the field for the blocked punt.\n\n\"It's one of those unforced errors we can't have happen,\" Gase said.\n\nTUCKER AUTOMATIC\n\nRavens kicker Justin Tucker is automatic from 50 yards or more.\n\nTucker connected on a 52-yarder for the Ravens' first points of the night. He also made a 59-yarder in Baltimore's preseason-opening win over Washington, and was 10 for 10 on tries from 50 yards or more last season.\n\nTucker also recovered a fumble on a misplayed kickoff return, one of Miami's many special-teams issues.\n\nQB WATCH\n\nDolphins backup Matt Moore, like Cutler, was also done for the night by the time the first quarter was over. He completed 3 of 5 passes for 11 yards, before getting relieved by David Fales. Brandon Doughty came in for Miami in the second half.\n\nCOMING HOME\n\nBaltimore's third quarterback, Thaddeus Lewis, was enjoying a homecoming. He played his high school ball at nearby Hialeah-Miami Lakes High.\n\nTOUGH START\n\nDolphins offensive lineman Sam Young was flagged for holding on consecutive plays in the first quarter, including one that wiped out the Cutler-to-Parker play for 31 yards.\n\nMORE OF THE SAME\n\nThe Ravens and Dolphins last met in December, with Baltimore winning that matchup 38-6. Baltimore is 25-9 in its last 34 preseason games.\n\n--\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP-NFL", "id": "9810192", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Cutler

They've stuck with Ryan Mallett, a move the veteran backup continues to leave open for second-guessing because of his sloppy play.\n\nMallett played the entire first half against the Dolphins and helped the Ravens to a six-point lead on their way to a 31-7 throttling of the Dolphins at Hard Rock Stadium.\n\n\"We made a couple plays, but not enough,\" Ravens wide receiver Mike Wallace said. \"We'll continue to get better.\"\n\nMallett found tight end Larry Donnell alone in the end zone for a 1-yard touchdown pass, and set up Justin Tucker for field goals of 52 and 27 yards. Otherwise, neither he nor the starting offense was able to ease any concerns about the play of the unit with Flacco sidelined in what was a hard-to-watch first half, made worse by deplorable field conditions.\n\nJosh Woodrum came in and led the Ravens to three second-half scoring drives to turn the game into a rout. He finalized two of the drives with touchdown runs, scoring from 14 yards and 1 yard out. The Ravens scored the game's final 31 points.\n\nBefore being relieved by Woodrum, Mallett completed 13 of 22 passes for 113 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions. He easily could've been picked off four times if Dolphins defenders would have held onto the ball.\n\nHis first interception was on a deep route down the far sideline. Miami cornerback Xavien Howard had inside position on undrafted rookie Quincy Adeboyejo and easily made the play. On his second pick, Mallett threw a slant behind Adeboyejo who had the ball wrestled out of his hands by Cordrea Tankersley.\n\nUnlike last week, Mallett was at least able to make a few plays down the field. He hit Wallace for completions of 19 and 14 yards. Tight end Benjamin Watson got in the act with an 11-yard completion for a first down. However, Mallett still struggled with his accuracy and didn't look overly comfortable in the pocket.\n\nIn two preseason games, Mallett has completed 22 of 40 passing attempts for 171 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions. He's expected to start again next week in the third preseason game against the Buffalo Bills.\n\n\"I'm always for pushing the ball down the field,\" Wallace said. \"I just want to make plays that are smart and move the ball. When we have an opportunity to make those chunk plays, we need to get that thing going.\"\n\nMallett was hardly alone in his struggles Thursday. Offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg was pleased that the Ravens had no pre-snap penalties in last week's preseason opener against the Washington Redskins. Ravens coach John Harbaugh was pleased that his team played winning football.\n\nBut that was not the case Thursday. Both Wallace and running back Terrance West fumbled in the first half, although the Ravens got both balls back. The Ravens couldn't convert on a fourth-and-2 at the Dolphins 41-yard line on their first drive as Mallett threw incomplete to Danny Woodhead.\n\nThe interior of the offensive line -- starting guards Jarrod Pughsley and Matt Skura, and center Ryan Jensen -- were frequently pushed back, leaving little running room for West. Starting tackles Austin Howard and James Hurst, and Skura were all called for holding penalties while Skura was also flagged for a false start.\n\nThat the Ravens scored 13 points was mostly because of shoddy special teams play by the Dolphins. That was exemplified by one stretch late in the third quarter after Tucker put the Ravens on the board with a 52-yard field goal, an impressive kick given the awful field conditions.\n\nOn the ensuing kickoff, Senorise Perry, who scored the Dolphins' first-half touchdown with a shifty 11-yard run, fumbled the ball and it was recovered by Tucker on the Miami 24-yard line. The Ravens' drive stalled and they settled for a 27-yard field goal by Tucker.\n\nThe Dolphins got the ball back and went three-and-out, but Matt Darr's punt was blocked by Chris Matthews who went unblocked because Miami didn't have enough players on the field. Matthews recovered the ball on the 9-yard line and that drive ended with Mallett hitting Donnell for the touchdown on third-and-goal from the 1-yard line.\n\njeff.zrebiec@baltsun.com\n\ntwitter.com/jeffzrebiecsun", "id": "9810078", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Mallett uneven again as Ravens' starting offense struggles in 31-7 win

You look for what's new in preseason and Xavien Howard flashed a bit of that Thursday night. He has been making plays in training camp, so it was notable he transferred those to the field with his interception of Ryan Mallett. Covering receiver Quincy Adeboyejo, Howard beat him to the ball near the end of the first quarter. Howard is expected to make a big leap this year after an injury-plagued rookie year. This kind of play says why.\n\n2. DeVante Parker showed what everyone has been talking about this offseason. He adjusted to Jay Cutler's back-shoulder pass down the right side for a 31-yard gain. It was called back by a holding penalty, but you still saw what he can do in preseason. He also took a Cutler pass over the middle for a 16-yard gain. All in all, a good night's work.\n\n3. Jay Cutler had a fine, first workout, as I wrote in my column on this game (though I don't quite understand the irrational optimism being placed on him, as I also said). He completed 3 of 6 passes for 24 yards, but had that 31-yarder called back. He ran a little no-huddle. He showed his passing strength with a flick of a sidearm pass downfield. He moved around in the pocket to miss pressure, always a good sign. And he took a hard hit on a screen pass -- the first time he's been hit hard since his season ended with shoulder injury last November. That's all you could expect to see in a preseason game. Two series and get him back to the sideline healthy.\n\n4. The Dolphins run defense became Topic A of their offseason plans. And for one preseason quarter against Baltimore's physical offense it got a passing grade. Four carries by Baltimore for 7 yards. You'd take that. At halftime, Baltimore had 15 carries for 50 yards. Again, you'd take that. Sure, it's tough to gauge exactly what it means and you need to see more. But this was a good impression of the top problem the Dolphins had last year.\n\n5. Depth? Yes, that is supposed to be improved for the Dolphins this year. So Thursday wasn't a good look when a 7-0 Dolphins lead led to 31 consecutive points pilled up on the Dolphins reserves. You can slough it off, if you want. But the bottom third of the roster was on display in some form here. And Baltimore's bottom third took it to the Dolphins bottom third.\n\n6. Sam Young had a rough night at right tackle in place of Ja'Wuan James (shoulder). Two holdings in the first six plays negated a 31-yard pass to Parker and a 19-yard pass to Jay Ajayi. This was another night the top line wasn't out there. In the first preseason game, only right guard Jermon Bushrod started. This time, Bushrod and left tackle Laremy Tunsil were the only sure starters. Jesse Davis started at left guard in a surprise. Maybe it was caused by Kraig Urbik (back) not playing. Yes, it's only preseason, but it's not a good sign when you're having to baby players through August.\n\n7. Cordrea Tankersley had an interception Byron Maxwell caused two fumbles. So both starting cornerbacks (Howard and Maxwell) and the third-round rookie Tankersley made the kind of game-tilting plays you like to see. Tankersley broke to the ball on a quick route and beat the receiver to teh ball. Two forced fumbles isn't something you expect, but Maxwell has been a regular at causing this with the Dolphins. He had five in his first five years. With the Dolphins last year, Maxwell had four forced fumbles.\n\n8. A small (25 people) protest supporting Colin Kapernick took place outside Gate 5 before Thursday's game. Let's just say this from the Dolphins standpoint: Once Jay Cutler was available to replace Ryan Tannehill, it didn't matter who else was. Gase worked with Cutler in Chicago. He likes Cutler. He thinks he can win with Cutler. Nothing and no one else really mattered once Cutler expressed an interest.\n\n9. Three quick notables: Davon Godchaux started again for Jordan Phillips, who subbed in the second series; linebacker Mike Hull had tight coverage on Danny Woodhead on a fourth-and-2 pass, resulting in a Ryan Mallett incompletion; Third-string quarterback David Fales threw a pass that made you sit up and notice on his 12-yard completion to Malcolm Lewis against the left sideline.\n\n10. Next week: Dolphins at Philadelphia. The noted third preseason game where you get the best preseason look at where teams stand. This follows a few days of practice between the teams, which is equally important in gauging players considering there's such limited contact in practice these days.\n\ndhyde@sun-sentinel.com; On Twitter @davehydesports;\n\nTo read Dave Hyde's blog click here.

Is he ready to do this? Is he ready to play and play well? (Ron Elkman/ Getty Images)\n\nThere is a lot of concern around Miami Dolphins camp these days.\n\nToo many injuries. Way too many injuries.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the various injuries affect how long Miami uses projected starters in Thursday night's preseason game against the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nHere are three position groups of great concern to the Dolphins tonight:\n\nQuarterback\n\nHow does Jay Cutler play in his first game action since he shut down his playing career and began preparing for a broadcasting career? Does Matt Moore play or does Cutler play into the second quarter or the entire first half, with youngsters Brandon Doughty and/or David Fales cleaning up? Does Cutler look like the gunslinger we've seen in the past? How expansive is Miami's playbook on Thursday night? Supposedly Cutler knows all the plays, just not all the names of the plays. Does he seem comfortable? Does he seem rattled? Does he make good decisions? Does he provide a reason for Dolphins fans and more importantly, his teammates and coaches, to believe he can be a capable replacement for Ryan Tannehill this season? Or does his performance spur widespread panic?\n\nMiddle Linebacker\n\nSorry to remind you that like Tannehill, projected starting middle linebacker Raekwon McMillan is out for the season with a knee injury. But, yeah, he's out for the season with a knee injury. Former undrafted linebacker Mike Hull, who is tough and scrappy and hard-nosed (and those are not backhanded compliments) will be given first crack at replacing McMillan on run downs. But is he the answer as Miami's third linebacker? It seems if the Dolphins add a linebacker in free agency they'd like it to be a thumper, which would allow them to keep Kiko Alonso and Lawrence Timmons on the outside. The Dolphins need to be better against the run in 2017. The McMillan plan ended before it even began. If Miami is trounced on the ground by Baltimore's running game... the pressure to add another linebacker will mount.\n\nGuard/Center\n\nThe interior of Miami's offensive line is always cause for concern. Cutler needs adequate protection. If center Mike Pouncey doesn't play and second-string center (and likely starting guard) Kraig Urbik doesn't play, center Jake Brendel must hold up. If right tackle Ja'Wuan James doesn't play, tackle Sam Young must hold up. If center/guard Anthony Steen plays left guard in place of injured Ted Larsen, he must be solid. This is not the offensive line Miami had hoped to have in 2017. It's been a bit under the radar because of so many concerns elsewhere, but Miami's plan to outscore opponents with high-powered offensive weapons like DeVante Parker, Jarvis Landry, Kenny Stills and Jay Ajayi goes completely out the window if its offensive line in any way regresses from last season, when, frankly, it was average.\n\nESPN: Only 7 teams worse than Miami Dolphins\n\nWilliam Hayes already knows he wants to finish his career a Miami Dolphin\n\nLinebacker Rey Maulauga to work out for Miami Dolphins\n\nWhy the Miami Dolphins are practicing with Philadelphia Eagles next week\n\nMiami Dolphins CB Tony Lippett (torn achilles) out for season", "id": "9806703", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "3 Concerning Miami Dolphins position groups in second preseason game | The Daily Dolphin", "image": "https://cmgpbpdailydolphin.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/cutlerdebut.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "182034", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "id": "305872", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback"}, {"label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "id": "309400", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker"}, {"label": {"eng": "Guard (American and Canadian football)"}, "id": "322621", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(American_and_Canadian_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Offensive line"}, "id": "324464", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_line"}, {"label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}, "id": "331328", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins"}, {"label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}, "id": "335402", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens"}, {"label": {"eng": "David Fales"}, "id": "346034", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fales"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jay Cutler (American football)"}, "id": "355416", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Cutler_(American_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ryan Tannehill"}, "id": "364505", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Tannehill"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kiko Alonso"}, "id": "379476", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiko_Alonso"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mike Pouncey"}, "id": "420397", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pouncey"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kraig Urbik"}, "id": "556258", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraig_Urbik"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jarvis Landry"}, "id": "1273951", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarvis_Landry"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ja'Wuan James"}, "id": "1286067", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ja'Wuan_James"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mike Hull (linebacker)"}, "id": "1308466", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Hull_(linebacker)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 93, "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora and Fauna", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora_and_Fauna"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 704, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel"}], "time": "09:32:00"}

With injuries to players who were projected to be key contributors on both sides of the ball, the Dolphins will host their second preseason game at Hard Rock Stadium against the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nThe Ravens have always been a formidable opponent and coach Adam Gase recognizes that the opportunity to go against a John Hardbaugh lead team will serve as a litmus for whether or not the 2017 Miami Dolphins are rounding into shape for opening day.\n\n\"That's why it's kind of nice that we're playing Baltimore,\" Gase said. \"It's another tough opponent with a lot of good players. They're going to be ready to go. [Baltimore Ravens Head] Coach [John] Harbaugh always has his crew ready to go very early and they're going to be looking to work on certain things, and for us to be able to play them, that's good for our guys.\n\n1. Jay Cutler will get his first live preseason action on Thursday. While Cutler clearly has mastery of the playbook, he's still developing timing with his wide receivers. Gase will likely call short rhythm passes that facilitate Cutler getting into a rhythm early in the contest. Due to the injuries along the offensive line, it would behoove Gase to help Cutler get the ball out of his hands quickly as they can ill afford to lose another quarterback.\n\n2. If the Dolphins hope to get Cutler into a rhythm they must get tight end MarQueis Gray involved early. Gray has easily been the Dolphins' most consistent tight end during camp, and his ability to get open on shallow crossing routes should help Cutler settle into the game rather quickly.\n\n3. Running back Jay Ajayi is no longer in the concussion protocol and has finally been cleared to play but he likely won't see action against the Ravens. Kenyan Drake will also be absent from Thursday's contest as he recently sustained a concussion. Expect Damien Williams and Storm Johnson to get quality carries on the night. Storm Johnson has shown during camp that he has the speed and vision to be a quality running back in the NFL.\n\n4. Mike Hull will get an extended look at the starting MIKE backer position now that Raekwon McMillan is out for the season with a torn ACL. Members of the Dolphins' starting defense have all the faith in the world in Hull. Hull stepped up big for the Dolphins in his lone start against the Arizona Cardinals in 2016, recording eight tackles and one interception.\n\n5. The Dolphins rookie defensive tackles Davon Godchaux and Vincent Taylor have had very good camps. Both players have done as instructed by their defensive line coach Terrell Williams and that's be very aggressive with offensive guards. Their physicality has earned them more playing time and it is clear that the Dolphins are expecting them to contribute sooner rather than later. If they can continue generating a surge at the point of attack on a consistent basis, they will contribute early and often in 2017.\n\nTV: CBS (Ch: 4 in Miami-Dade/Broward and 12 in Palm Beach); Radio: 560-AM, 99.9-FM, 1140-AM (Spanish); 106.3-FM (West Palm Beach) 760-AM (West Palm Beach; Spanish)", "id": "9828810", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Dolphins vs. Ravens: five things to watch - Sports Talk Florida", "image": "https://i.sportstalkflorida.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/USATSI_10205559-e1502984287965.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "189313", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Interception"}, "id": "304976", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "id": "305661", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "id": "305872", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}, "id": "310130", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tight end"}, "id": "312020", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end"}, {"label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}, "id": "313823", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals"}, {"label": {"eng": "Guard (American and Canadian football)"}, "id": "322621", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(American_and_Canadian_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "id": "324224", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back"}, {"label": {"eng": "Offensive line"}, "id": "324464", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_line"}, {"label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}, "id": "331328", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins"}, {"label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}, "id": "335402", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens"}, {"label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}, "id": "336937", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adam Gase"}, "id": "341272", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Gase"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jay Cutler (American football)"}, "id": "355416", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Cutler_(American_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Raekwon"}, "id": "360727", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raekwon"}, {"label": {"eng": "MarQueis Gray"}, "id": "720318", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MarQueis_Gray"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jay Ajayi"}, "id": "1270836", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Ajayi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mike Hull (linebacker)"}, "id": "1308466", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Hull_(linebacker)"}], "location": null, "categories": [], "time": "14:14:00"}

The Baltimore Ravens defeated the Dolphins 31-7 on Thursday night.\n\nHere were the takeaways from all three sides of the ball for the Dolphins.\n\nOffense\n\nWhen he was in there, Dolphins quarterback Jay Cutler was impressive. Sure his 3 of 6 passes for 24 yards may not indicate that, but Cutler made some nice plays down the field, especially to DeVante Parker.\n\nDolphins Running back Senorise Perry scored on an 11-yard touchdown run in the second quarter. Overall, Perry carried the ball six times for 25 yards.\n\nMiami's offensive line struggled early in the game. Tackle Sam Young was called for two holding penalties on one drive. The Dolphins not only missed Ju'Wuan James, but they also missed Mike Pouncey at center.\n\nObviously, the Dolphins will need to improve on their offensive output in the weeks leading up to the regular season.\n\nDefense\n\nThe good for the Dolphins was they were able to intercept quarterback Ryan Mallett twice on Thursday night. They were able to limit the production by Mallett and the Ravens offense in the first half.\n\nCornerback Byron Maxwell had two strips in the first half. Dolphins head coach Adam Gase said at halftime that he was impressed with the defensive performance.\n\n\"It was great to see the sudden change, guys stepping up and holding them to the field goal,\" Gase said. \"The turnover was great and getting balls on the ground, that's what we've been talking about. Let's get it out and see if we can get it back.\"\n\nThe bad was the Dolphins gave up 18 points and the backups gave up a lot of yards in the second half.\n\nSpecial Teams\n\nTo say Miami's special teams unit was bad on Thursday would be an understatement. The Dolphins committed two penalties, had a punt blocked. Also, two special teams miscues led to Ravens points.\n\nDolphins special teams coordinator Darren Rizzi isn't going to be happy with his until after tonight's horrible performance.", "id": "9828789", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Instant analysis from Dolphins preseason loss to Ravens", "image": "https://usatdolphinswire.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/usatsi_10224737.jpg?w=640", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "182034", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}, "id": "302611", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}, "id": "304975", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback"}, {"label": {"eng": "Head coach"}, "id": "305436", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach"}, {"label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "id": "305872", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback"}, {"label": {"eng": "Center (American and Canadian football)"}, "id": "311351", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(American_and_Canadian_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "id": "324224", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back"}, {"label": {"eng": "Offensive line"}, "id": "324464", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_line"}, {"label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}, "id": "331328", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins"}, {"label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}, "id": "335402", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adam Gase"}, "id": "341272", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Gase"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jay Cutler (American football)"}, "id": "355416", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Cutler_(American_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Byron Maxwell"}, "id": "397241", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Maxwell"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mike Pouncey"}, "id": "420397", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pouncey"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ryan Mallett"}, "id": "420986", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Mallett"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mallett"}, "id": "526360", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallett"}, {"label": {"eng": "Special Teams"}, "id": "556232", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Teams"}, {"label": {"eng": "Field goal"}, "id": "1268994", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal"}, {"label": {"eng": "DeVante Parker"}, "id": "1275204", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeVante_Parker"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 28, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 36, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 93, "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora and Fauna", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora_and_Fauna"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 320, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 704, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel"}], "time": "00:14:00"}

Former Arkansas Razorback Ryan Mallett threw for 113 yards and a touchdown in the first half, Josh Woodrum ran for two more scores and the Baltimore Ravens beat the Dolphins 31-7 on Thursday night in the second preseason game for both teams.\n\n\"Dr. Bowen in Chicago, nice job,\" Cutler said, with a thumbs-up for emphasis.\n\nCutler played the first two series for the Dolphins, his debut as injured starter Ryan Tannehill's replacement in Miami. He was 3 of 6 for 24 yards, some of it in a no-huddle tempo, and his highlight play was one that didn't count. Facing a third-and-16, Cutler stepped up and found DeVante Parker for what would have been a 31-yard gain -- one erased by a holding flag.\n\n\"Thought he was good,\" said Dolphins Coach Adam Gase, who also coached Cutler in Chicago. \"First time out. Looks like we really weren't apart for a year. His tempo was really good.\"\n\nCutler took a big hit on his last snap, courtesy of the Ravens' Za'Darius Smith. He got up without any problem, then switched his helmet for a baseball cap and headset.\n\n\"I was kind of glad to get that one out of the way,\" Cutler said.\n\nRavens starting quarterback Joe Flacco isn't expected to play until Week 1 of the regular season because of back woes, and Mallett played the entire first half.\n\n\"I thought he did good,\" Ravens Coach John Harbaugh said. \"He got out of trouble a few times. He made a few throws.\"\n\nMallett completed 13 of 22 passes, getting intercepted twice -- both on passes intended for Quincy Adeboyejo. The first pick was by Xavier Howard on a ball lofted down the left sideline and overthrown, the other coming when Cordrea Tankersley ripped the ball out of Adeboyejo's hands after he had to reach back to make a catch on a quick slant.\n\n\"I think I played better,\" Mallett said. \"There's still plays to be made.\"\n\nEAGLES 20, BILLS 16\n\nPHILADELPHIA -- Cornerback Ronald Darby was the most impressive of all the new players for the Eagles.\n\nDarby intercepted former teammate Tyrod Taylor's pass and returned it 48 yards and also broke up two passes in his first game since Philadelphia acquired him from Buffalo last week, and the Eagles beat the Bills.\n\nAlshon Jeffery, a former Pro Bowl wide receiver signed by the Eagles in the offseason, caught his first pass from Carson Wentz and finished with two receptions for 23 yards.\n\nBills cornerback E.J. Gaines also had an interception in his first game since coming from the Rams in a trade last week. Gaines picked third-string quarterback Matt McGloin, who has struggled in two preseason games.\n\nBUCCANEERS 12, JAGUARS 8\n\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Jameis Winston continued his solid preseason, completing 21 of 29 passes for 196 yards and helping the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat woeful Jacksonville.\n\nWinston had two passes dropped, including what would have been a 43-yard touchdown strike to Mike Evans in the first quarter.\n\nThe Buccaneers (1-1) scored on their first three possessions, getting a short touchdown run from Doug Martin and two field goals from Nick Folk. Tampa Bay dominated Jacksonville in two quarters that featured mostly starters, outgaining the Jags 240-59 and looking like the much better team.\n\nFolk, who won the kicking job last week after the Bucs waived former second-round draft pick Roberto Aguayo, had an extra point blocked by Calais Campbell.

We had penalties on the play, so it was negated, but he felt good.\"\n\nCutler took a big hit on his last snap, courtesy of the Ravens' Za'Darius Smith. He got up without any problem, then switched his helmet for a baseball cap and headset.\n\n\"He's having fun,\" Gase said.\n\nRavens starting quarterback Joe Flacco isn't expected to play until Week 1 of the regular season because of back woes, and Mallett played the entire first half.\n\nMallett completed 13 of 22 passes, getting intercepted twice - both on passes intended for Quincy Adeboyejo. The first pick was by Xavier Howard on a ball lofted down the left sideline and overthrow, the other coming when Cordrea Tankersley ripped the ball out of Adeboyejo's hands after he had to reach back to make a catch on a quick slant.\n\nWoodrum completed eight of 10 passes for 110 yards.\n\nThe Dolphins' storyline coming into Thursday was all about Cutler, and his first game action with Miami. For as much hubbub as there was for that, there likely was as much concern about special teams when the night ended.\n\nSenorise Perry had an 11-yard touchdown run for Miami, but he also fumbled away a kickoff return - one of many Miami special-teams miscues. The Dolphins also had a punt blocked in the second quarter, setting up Mallett's 1-yard touchdown toss to Larry Donnell, and later had a hold on a kickoff return.\n\nGase said Miami had 10 men on the field for the blocked punt.\n\n\"It's one of those unforced errors we can't have happen,\" Gase said.\n\nTUCKER AUTOMATIC\n\nRavens kicker Justin Tucker is automatic from 50 yards or more.\n\nTucker connected on a 52-yarder for the Ravens' first points of the night. He also made a 59-yarder in Baltimore's preseason-opening win over Washington, and was 10 for 10 on tries from 50 yards or more last season.\n\nTucker also recovered a fumble on a misplayed kickoff return, one of Miami's many special-teams issues.\n\nQB WATCH\n\nDolphins backup Matt Moore, like Cutler, was also done for the night by the time the first quarter was over. He completed 3 of 5 passes for 11 yards, before getting relieved by David Fales. Brandon Doughty came in for Miami in the second half.\n\nCOMING HOME\n\nBaltimore's third quarterback, Thaddeus Lewis, was enjoying a homecoming. He played his high school ball at nearby Hialeah-Miami Lakes High.\n\nTOUGH START\n\nDolphins offensive lineman Sam Young was flagged for holding on consecutive plays in the first quarter, including one that wiped out the Cutler-to-Parker play for 31 yards.\n\nMORE OF THE SAME\n\nThe Ravens and Dolphins last met in December, with Baltimore winning that matchup 38-6. Baltimore is 25-9 in its last 34 preseason games.", "id": "9810191", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "The Colorado Springs Gazette", "image": null, "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl":

Cutler ended 3 of 6 passing for 24 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions. He played two series, which amounted to nine snaps.\n\nBaltimore (2-0), which has been dealing with a rash of offseason injuries, including a back problem that still has No. 1 quarterback Joe Flacco sidelined, scored 31 unanswered points to overcome a 7-0 deficit early in the second quarter.\n\nThe Ravens, who rushed for 117 yards, took advantage of a pivotal second-quarter stretch to take the lead for good. Tucker kicked a 52-yard field goal, recovered a fumble by Miami kick returner Senorice Perry, and then kicked a 27-yard field goal in a span of 2:14 to cut the deficit to 7-6.\n\nBaltimore added a 1-yard touchdown pass from Mallett (13 of 22, two interceptions) to tight end Larry Donnell to take a 13-7 halftime lead.\n\nRavens quarterback Josh Woodrum finished 8 of 10 for 110 yards while running back Javorius Allen led Baltimore in rushing (10 carries, 40 yards).\n\nAjayi, a Pro Bowl selection last year after rushing for 1,272 yards, ended with two carries for minus-2 yards and one reception for 11 yards. Ajayi had a 19-yard carry wiped out by a holding penalty.\n\nIn the big picture, Miami is hoping Cutler can get up to speed quickly enough to replicate the success he had under Dolphins head coach Adam Gase in 2015 in Chicago. Gase served as the Bears' offensive coordinator that year. Cutler finished the 2015 season with 21 touchdowns, 11 interceptions, and a career-best 92.3 passer rating.\n\nThe Ravens host Buffalo on Aug. 26, while Miami visits Philadelphia on Aug. 24.", "id":

The guy everyone wanted to see. Making his first preseason start. Making his first big play. There it was Thursday night.\n\nThere he was:\n\nMike Hull.\n\nWhat, you were watching the other new starter?\n\nOK, then. Jay Cutler was cheered for just trotting on the field for the first time in a Miami Dolphins uniform. He handed off to Jay Ajayi on the first play. He completed a couple easy passes -- a dump that Ajayi took 11 yards; a receiver screen to Jarvis Landry -- in a typical script by coach Adam Gase to strike a rhythm.\n\nCutler then threw a nifty back-shoulder pass that DeVante Parker adjusted to for a 31-yard play. It was called back by a holding penalty. But who cares? It's preseason. The penalty doesn't erase the imprint of that play the two had choreographed for the same result in a practice last week.\n\nYou saw in that pass what Cutler can do. Same as with an over-the-middle strike to Parker on the second series for 16 yards. Same as with the ball he threw up for grabs between Parker and two Baltimore defenders. It fell incomplete.\n\nGood? Let's just grade it a good workout. He ran the offense a couple series with no scores. He played in a live competition for the first time since last November. And he stayed on the sideline after two series where he completed 3 of 6 passes for 24 yards.\n\nOne more notable: He didn't get hurt. Nor did Ajayi, who played one series. Nor, it appears, did any starter considering they were done by the first quarter, though a head and ligament count won't be coming until Friday. That's a win, right there.\n\nCutler was the one everyone wanted to see, though. There's this odd and optimistic feeling you sense from Dolphins fans around Cutler that can be summed up like this: He'll be as good as Ryan Tannehill -- maybe better.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nGase, the answer seems to be.\n\nYou can believe Gase gets the most out of players. You can believe Cutler never played with this coaching and player support. You can believe Gase and Cutler have a developed connection that means they'll work well together.\n\nYou can believe all that and it still doesn't add up to him being as good as Tannehill. Tannehill had a 100.9 rating his last eight games of 2016 -- the ones, you remember, when the season got going. He had 13 touchdowns and five interceptions in that span. That's 2.6 touchdowns for every interception.\n\nHe also had 28 touchdowns and 12 interceptions in 2014 when the coach (Joe Philbin) didn't like him and the offensive coordinator (Bill Lazor) didn't trust him. That's 2.3 touchdowns for every interception.\n\nCutler has never thrown two touchdowns for every interception in a season. In 11 years, he's never had a rating above the 92.3 he had when Gase was his Chicago coordinator in 2015. He's never proved he can lift a team with his play.\n\nPlease, understand: This isn't to dismiss Cutler. It's not even to criticize him. He's certainly the best available option when Tannehill got hurt. He keeps the season afloat when it could have sunk right then. He might even have a great season when reuinted with Gase. Who knows?\n\nIt's this irrational optimism over him that's a head-scratcher. The good-as-Tannehill camp leads down two paths: 1) What Tannehill did before his injury last year wasn't something to believe in -- nor was Tannehill in his second year with Gase; 2) They really, truly believe Gase has superpowers.\n\nCutler had a nice workout Thursday night. He'll give the Dolphins a professional at quarterback. But better than Tannehill? Denver and Chicago didn't see that kind of play in 11 seasons from him. Expectations shouldn't be for it now.\n\nThen again, sports is in the business of hope. Maybe it happens for Cutler this year. Maybe his 12th season is the charm. If you want to believe it will be, and that he's clearly better than Tannehill, be my guest.\n\ndhyde@sun-sentinel.com; On Twitter @davehydesports;\n\nTo read Dave Hyde's blog click here.

Former Arkansas Razorback Ryan Mallett threw for 113 yards and a touchdown in the first half, Josh Woodrum ran for two more scores and the Baltimore Ravens beat the Dolphins 31-7 on Thursday night in the second preseason game for both teams.\n\n\"Dr. Bowen in Chicago, nice job,\" Cutler said, with a thumbs-up for emphasis.\n\nCutler played the first two series for the Dolphins, his debut as injured starter Ryan Tannehill's replacement in Miami. He was 3 of 6 for 24 yards, some of it in a no-huddle tempo, and his highlight play was one that didn't count. Facing a third-and-16, Cutler stepped up and found DeVante Parker for what would have been a 31-yard gain -- one erased by a holding flag.\n\n\"Thought he was good,\" said Dolphins Coach Adam Gase, who also coached Cutler in Chicago. \"First time out. Looks like we really weren't apart for a year. His tempo was really good.\"\n\nCutler took a big hit on his last snap, courtesy of the Ravens' Za'Darius Smith. He got up without any problem, then switched his helmet for a baseball cap and headset.\n\n\"I was kind of glad to get that one out of the way,\" Cutler said.\n\nRavens starting quarterback Joe Flacco isn't expected to play until Week 1 of the regular season because of back woes, and Mallett played the entire first half.\n\n\"I thought he did good,\" Ravens Coach John Harbaugh said. \"He got out of trouble a few times. He made a few throws.\"\n\nMallett completed 13 of 22 passes, getting intercepted twice -- both on passes intended for Quincy Adeboyejo. The first pick was by Xavier Howard on a ball lofted down the left sideline and overthrown, the other coming when Cordrea Tankersley ripped the ball out of Adeboyejo's hands after he had to reach back to make a catch on a quick slant.\n\n\"I think I played better,\" Mallett said. \"There's still plays to be made.\"\n\nEAGLES 20, BILLS 16\n\nPHILADELPHIA -- Cornerback Ronald Darby was the most impressive of all the new players for the Eagles.\n\nDarby intercepted former teammate Tyrod Taylor's pass and returned it 48 yards and also broke up two passes in his first game since Philadelphia acquired him from Buffalo last week, and the Eagles beat the Bills.\n\nAlshon Jeffery, a former Pro Bowl wide receiver signed by the Eagles in the offseason, caught his first pass from Carson Wentz and finished with two receptions for 23 yards.\n\nBills cornerback E.J. Gaines also had an interception in his first game since coming from the Rams in a trade last week. Gaines picked third-string quarterback Matt McGloin, who has struggled in two preseason games.\n\nBUCCANEERS 12, JAGUARS 8\n\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Jameis Winston continued his solid preseason, completing 21 of 29 passes for 196 yards and helping the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat woeful Jacksonville.\n\nWinston had two passes dropped, including what would have been a 43-yard touchdown strike to Mike Evans in the first quarter.\n\nThe Buccaneers (1-1) scored on their first three possessions, getting a short touchdown run from Doug Martin and two field goals from Nick Folk. Tampa Bay dominated Jacksonville in two quarters that featured mostly starters, outgaining the Jags 240-59 and looking like the much better team.\n\nFolk, who won the kicking job last week after the Bucs waived former second-round draft pick Roberto Aguayo, had an extra point blocked by Calais Campbell.

This will be a battle of the two most injury plagued teams this preseason.\n\nCutler's Debut\n\nSmokin' Jay Cutler will start at quarterback for the first time. While he will only play a series or two, this is an important step for Cutler and the Dolphins offense.\n\nDespite only being a part of the roster for two weeks, Cutler is familiar with head coach Adam Gase's system. This will help the offense move on from the loss of quarterback Ryan Tannehill. Tannehill had reconstructive ACL surgery today and will be sidelined for the season.\n\nCutler had his best season in 2015 when he played for the Chicago Bears and Gase was the offensive coordinator. During that season the Bear's were fifth in the league in rushing attempts. This should carry over to this season; Gase has stated he hopes to get running back Jay Ajayi 350 carries. Unfortunately, while Ajayi has cleared concussion protocol it is unlikely he will play today.\n\nInjuries Pile On\n\nThe offense will also be without starting guard Ted Larsen (biceps), starting center Mike Pouncey (hip) and backup running back Kenyan Drake (concussion). Wide receivers Kenny Stills (hamstring) and Leonte Carroo (hamstring), tight end Julius Thomas(back), right tackle Ja'Wuan James (shoulder) and guard-center Kraig Urbik (back) are all questionable.\n\nDespite these injuries, expect the offense to use running back Damien Williams to establish the run early against a stiff Ravens defense. Then they will work in some play-action to get Cutler comfortable. Once Cutler gets his feet wet, expect to see the same gunslinger mentality that has made him one of the most enigmatic quarterbacks of the past decade. Wide receiver Devantae Parker should have a career year with Cutler, whose more adept at taking shots down the field.\n\nYoung Studs\n\nThe 'Fins coaching staff will be keeping their eyes on rookie fifth round pick Isaac Asiata and Anthony Steen as they battle for the starting left guard position, left vacant due to Ted Larsen's torn biceps muscle. Undrafted rookie tackle Eric Smith, who received praise from Gase and the coaching staff, will look to build off a strong outing last week. He played more snaps than any other Dolphin and give up only one quarterback pressure.\n\nOn the outside, rookie receiver Damore'ea Stringfellow looks to make another good impression this week after he had two catches for 116 yards, including a game winning 99 yard touchdown, in week one.\n\nAROUND COVER32\n\nFree Agency: Seahawks sign former 49ers' CB, Tramaine Brock, to a one-year deal\n\nAround the NFL: Eli Manning thinks he can keep playing until the age of 40\n\nWhat's Trending: Brandon Marshall says war of words with Sheldon Richardson is dead\n\nNFL Reaction: Braden Holeck gives his reaction after attending Chiefs' training camp\n\n2018 NFL Draft: Will North Carolina State DE, Bradley Chubb, standout in 2018's deep edge rushing class\n\ncover32 Podcasts: Check out our latest podcasts and view our entire library available on Apple iTunes\n\nDefense\n\nOn the defensive side of the ball the Dolphins should look to take advantage of an injury-riddled Ravens offense that will be without franchise quarterback Joe Flacco. Ryan Mallett will take over the reins of the first team offense in his absence.\n\nThe Dolphins defense will be without starting linebacker Raekwon McMillan and cornerback Tony Lippett, who are both out for the season. Nate Allen(groin), the projected starter at safety while T.J. McDonald serves an eight game suspension for violating the league's substance abuse policy, and linebacker Neville Hewitt(shoulder) are questionable.\n\nLinebacker Mike Hull will get a shot at winning the starting middle linebacker position following Raekwon McMillan's injury. He will need to impress coaches in order to do so. If Hull struggles, Hewitt could press him for the position. The coaching staff have also considered moving outside linebackers Kiko Alonso or Lawrence Timmons inside. They also brought in former Bengal Rey Maualuga for a workout this past week.\n\nFirst round pick Charles Harris will continue to push veteran Andre Branch for the starting defensive end position opposite Cameron Wake. Fellow rookie defensive tackle Davon Godchaux will be Mic'd up and look to continue his strong preseason thus far.\n\nWhile the Dolphins should win this game, the final score is not truly important. If both teams get through this game without any more significant injuries, both teams will take that as a victory.\n\nThe post Game Preview: Dolphins vs Ravens appeared first on Cover32.", "id": "9806694", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Game Preview: Dolphins vs Ravens", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5tLSqtNM7BxK3te5Zi1SkA--/aD00NTA7dz03MTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/cover32_362/43c28f11685b5bb8e4944ba2170fdc1a", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}, "id": "302611", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown"}, {"label": {"eng": "Muscle"}, "id": "302851", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle"}, {"label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}, "id": "303413", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}, "id": "304975", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback"}, {"label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}, "id": "305439", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "id": "305661", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "id": "305872", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback"}, {"label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "id": "309400", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker"}, {"label": {"eng": "Safety (American and Canadian football position)"}, "id": "309405", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}, "id": "310130", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver"}, {"label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}, "id": "310749", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end"}, {"label": {"eng": "Podcast"}, "id": "311311", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tight end"}, "id": "312020", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end"}, {"label": {"eng": "Guard (American and Canadian football)"}, "id": "322621", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(American_and_Canadian_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}, "id": "323465", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring"}, {"label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "id": "324224", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back"}, {"label": {"eng": "Eli Manning"}, "id": "331326", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Manning"}, {"label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}, "id": "331327", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers"}, {"label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}, "id": "331328", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins"}, {"label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}, "id": "335402", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adam Gase"}, "id": "341272", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Gase"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}, "id": "342459", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears"}, {"label": {"eng": "Joe Flacco"}, "id": "342533", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Flacco"}, {"label": {"eng": "Brandon Marshall"}, "id": "355415", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Marshall"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jay Cutler (American football)"}, "id": "355416", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Cutler_(American_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Raekwon"}, "id": "360727", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raekwon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ryan Tannehill"}, "id": "364505", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Tannehill"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sheldon Richardson"}, "id": "379059", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Richardson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lawrence Timmons"}, "id": "379072", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Timmons"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kiko Alonso"}, "id": "379476", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiko_Alonso"}, {"label": {"eng": "T.

(AP) -- Ryan Mallett threw for 113 yards and a touchdown, Josh Woodrum ran for two more scores and the Baltimore Ravens beat the Dolphins 31-7 on Thursday night in the second preseason game for both teams.\n\nRavens starting quarterback Joe Flacco isn't expected to play until Week 1 of the regular season because of back woes, and Mallett played the entire first half.\n\nMallett completed 13 of 22 passes, getting intercepted twice - both on passes intended for Quincy Adeboyejo. The first pick was by Xavier Howard on a ball lofted down the left sideline and overthrow, the other coming when Cordrea Tankersley ripped the ball out of Adeboyejo's hands after he had to reach back to make a catch on a quick slant.\n\nWoodrum completed eight of 10 passes for 110 yards.\n\nThe Dolphins' storyline coming into Thursday was all about Jay Cutler, and his first game action with Miami. For as much hubbub as there was for that, there likely was as much concern about special teams when the night ended.\n\nSenorise Perry had an 11-yard touchdown run for Miami, but he also fumbled away a kickoff return - one of many Miami special-teams miscues. The Dolphins also had a punt blocked in the second quarter, setting up Mallett's 1-yard touchdown toss to Larry Donnell, and later had a hold on a kickoff return.\n\nGase said Miami had 10 men on the field for the blocked punt.\n\n\"It's one of those unforced errors we can't have happen,\" Gase said.\n\nTUCKER AUTOMATIC\n\nRavens kicker Justin Tucker is automatic from 50 yards or more.\n\nTucker connected on a 52-yarder for the Ravens' first points of the night. He also made a 59-yarder in Baltimore's preseason-opening win over Washington, and was 10 for 10 on tries from 50 yards or more last season.\n\nTucker also recovered a fumble on a misplayed kickoff return, one of Miami's many special-teams issues.\n\nQB WATCH\n\nDolphins backup Matt Moore, like Cutler, was also done for the night by the time the first quarter was over. He completed 3 of 5 passes for 11 yards, before getting relieved by David Fales. Brandon Doughty came in for Miami in the second half.\n\nCOMING HOME\n\nBaltimore's third quarterback, Thaddeus Lewis, was enjoying a homecoming. He played his high school ball at nearby Hialeah-Miami Lakes High.\n\nMORE OF THE SAME\n\nThe Ravens and Dolphins last met in December, with Baltimore winning that matchup 38-6. Baltimore is 25-9 in its last 34 preseason games.\n\n\u00a9 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

Keep an open mind, Adam Gase. Not so fast to etch that quarterback depth chart in stone, OK?\n\nWe are expected to see a larger, longer dose of starting QB-designate Jay Cutler in Fake Game 3 next week at Philadelphia. Meanwhile, what we saw from Cutler in his preseason debut Thursday night at The Rock should neither have cemented his claim to the job left open by Ryan Tannehill's injury nor cast it into immediate doubt. What it did was make you think, \"Hmm, why isn't this an open competition between the recently signed Cutler and the veteran-backup Moore?\"\n\nCutler completed 3-of-6 passes for 24 yards, a 60.4 passer rating, in two scoreless series vs. the Ravens. In fairness, a 31-yard strike to DeVante Parker was erased by a penalty. Moore came in and was 3-for-5 for 11 yards, also hardly lighting it up. The point is, with two exhibitions left, one of these two men should have to earn the job, not be handed it as seems to be the case with Cutler, as when Gase saof f Cjutler. .\n\nYes, the Dolphins got clobbered 31-7, which would be embarrassing if you believed it mattered for anything. But keep telling yourself, \"Preseason results don't matter!\" (And then adding, as an aside, \"Right...?\")\n\nLost in the Cutler debut was the first preseason appearance for rising-star running back Jay Ajayi, newly out of concussion protocol and cleared to play. Nuthin' special in the expected minimal action. Two carries for one yard and minus-three yards, one catch, zero concussions. Don't worry about Jay. Assuming the bell stays un-rung, he'll be just fine.\n\nMaybe the best news for Miami? No significant player was seriously hurt. Count that as a victory unto itself. After a training camp that saw Tannehill, starting middle linebacker Raekwon McMillan and counted-on cornerback Tony Lippett all lost to season-ending injuries, the absence of TV face time Thursday night for Dolphins doctors and trainers was something to cheer.\n\nAspiring third-string QB David Fales got a long look with modest results but did lead the Fins scoring drive that made it 7-0, finished by Senorise Perry's touchdown. Trying to make the final roster by getting coaches' attention in August? Score on an 11-yard run after earliest breaking a 33-yard kickoff return. (Oops, but that lost fumble may be what's remembered more...).\n\nCornerback Xavien Howard, limited to seven games with zero interceptions by injury his rookie season, introduced himself better late than never with a pick Thursday night. The corner play of Byron Maxwell (who jarred two balls loose Thursday) and Howard, especially in light of Lippett's injury, will be so crucial this season. Rookie CB Cordrea Tankersley also had a pick, reminding Ravens fans everywhere that Ryan Mallett is not Joe Flacco.\n\nFins trailed for first time, 13-7, after a play that should give excellent special-teams coach Darren Rizzi indigestion. Miami had a punt blocked and recovered by Ravens at MIA 9 after Dolphins scrambled to get an 11th man on the field and had another penalty on the play.\n\nLinebacker Mike Hull had a really active night and sort of raised his hand and said \"Me!\" in the jockeying to replace the injured McMillan at MLB.\n\nNice moment: Rookie defensive tackle Davon Godchaux wore a live microphone for TV, and we saw and heard Ndamukong Suh favoring the rook with tips and advice on the sideline. Suh fears no man. Not the one trying to block him. And not the one trying to take his job.\n\nDid the game overall verify to doubters why preseason NFL football is hardly worth watching except to roster-evaluating coaches? And why so few fans actually do watch? Rhetorical questions.

Other than that, it was a dull evening for the Dolphins' starters.\n\n1. The most important part of Cutler's night: showing awareness.\n\nCutler wasn't particularly good or bad in his two series, and it didn't help that the makeshift offensive line struggled to protect him. However, he did well under the circumstances. His most impressive play of the night came when the pocket was collapsing and he stepped up and fired a 31-yarder to DeVante Parker down the right sideline (it was called back because of a holding penalty). Cutler finished 3 of 6 for 24 yards.\n\n\"He had a couple really nice moves in the pocket, pushing up and making a couple guys miss,\" coach Adam Gase said. \"We had penalties on the (Parker) play, so it was negated; but he felt good.\"\n\n2. Evidence continues to mount in favor of Parker having a breakout year.\n\nMiami's still waiting for Parker to live up to being the No. 14 overall pick in 2015, and in Year 3 it looks like that time has arrived. Not only has he been very good throughout training camp and the preseason, including the nullified 31-yarder and a 16-yard catch against the Ravens, but he's stayed healthy. Parker has been on the field every day thus far and there's never even been a whisper of an injury with him. People have often said that's the only thing holding him back, and it's not anymore.\n\n3. The Dolphins' offensive line is terrifying\n\nMiami's adjusted starting five on the o-line -- factoring in Ted Larsen's extended absence -- might not take the field together prior to opening day. Jake Brendel, who probably will end up as the third-string center, started against Baltimore in place of Mike Pouncey, Sam Young filled in for injured right tackle Ja'Wuan James and Jesse Davis worked at left guard. Young committed two holds, Jay Ajayi had one carry for minus-two yards and the offense managed 61 yards on 20 plays in the first quarter.\n\n4. Defensive tackle Jordan Phillips remains on the wrong track.\n\nThe Dolphins' handling of Phillips this preseason has gone past the point of merely trying to motivate him. After two underwhelming seasons, Phillips called himself out as inconsistent this offseason and vowed to change, but it's the same story. The Dolphins feel that way, too, evidenced by leaving him in with camp invitees into the fourth quarter. Fifth-round pick Davon Godchaux started ahead of him for the second straight game and is playing well enough to keep the job. He had two tackles and got good push on the line in the first half.\n\n5. The main goal at this point is to escape healthy.\n\nEvery practice or game that doesn't result in a major Dolphins injury is a victory at this point. Consider tonight a win in that regard. Ajayi took a big hit, Cutler got one as well, new starting middle linebacker Mike Hull played into the second quarter, and all of them survived intact. Miami was wise to get its starters out before the field deteriorated, too.\n\n[Jay Ajayi shakes off \"fog\" of concussion, ready to play]", "id": "9828793", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18",

His play is even more glaring when Josh Woodrum continues to come in and lead the offense on scoring drives. But let's remember Woodrum is doing that against backups. Remember when Josh Johnson was heralded last summer and Bryn Renner the year before that? Beyond the quarterback situation, the Ravens have a lot of good young talent on this roster. Their backups have completely overwhelmed the opposition these past two weeks, a good indication of the depth they have. They'll have some tough decisions to make in the coming weeks. Justin Tucker, Maxx Williams, Buck Allen, Jaylen Hill, Woodrum and Za'Darius Smith were among the standouts Thursday night.\n\nMike Preston, columnist: The Ravens don't have anything going offensively because they haven't built any continuity. If Joe Flacco goes down with another injury, this team is really in trouble because they can't win consistently with backup Ryan Mallett. In fact, No. 3 quarterback Josh Woodrum threw better than Mallett Thursday night. Defensively, the Ravens can bring the heat on opposing quarterbacks. They can win one-on-one battles or generate pressure with blitzes.\n\nPeter Schmuck, columnist: The defense was stifling again, but the key question of the preseason remains unanswered. Fill-in quarterback Ryan Mallett showed some improvement over last week's performance, but he still did not seem to be in sync with a better group of receivers. He threw a short touchdown pass after the Ravens recovered a blocked punt deep in Miami territory and threw two interceptions, though one was not entirely his fault. On the brighter side of the offensive performance, running back Buck Allen pounded out 40 tough yards on 10 carries and Maxx Williams made a couple of big catches. Second-half quarterback Josh Woodrum, who had a perfect QB rating in last week's game, ran for two touchdowns in another impressive performance, but don't hold your breath waiting for a quarterback controversy to develop.\n\nChilds Walker, sports reporter: The story didn't change much this week as the starting defense dominated and the starting offense played erratically. With so much beef in the middle and so many good players on the back end, the Ravens will be a bear to score on. But it's almost impossible to gauge their offensive progress as long as Ryan Mallett is starting, even though he did make a few more standout plays this time around. That makes these games frustrating to watch, no matter the results.\n\nEdward Lee, sports reporter: As convincing as the final score was, there should still be some concerns about the starting offense. That unit was stuck in neutral throughout the first quarter, and the Ravens needed huge plays on special teams to get Justin Tucker's second field goal and Larry Donnell's touchdown catch to take a 13-7 lead in the second quarter. The offensive line was a patchwork group, but Ryan Mallett still underthrew or threw behind his receivers.\n\nRon Fritz, sports editor: It's hard to get too excited because the Dolphins are terrible, but the Ravens just dominated on defense and on special teams. What was Jay Cutler thinking? Go back to the comfort of the broadcast booth. On offense, the Ravens made too many mistakes, especially quarterback Ryan Mallett. But there are better college offensive lines than the one the Ravens fielded. I'm not sure you're going to see anything resembling an offense until about Week 4 of the regular season.", "id": "9810720", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Instant analysis of the Ravens' 31-7 preseason victory over the Dolphins", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-59965142/turbine/bs-sp-ravens-instant-analysis-0817", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Sport"}, "id": "302606", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}, "id": "302611", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown"}, {"label": {"eng": "Journalist"}, "id": "304358", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist"}, {"label": {"eng": "Interception"}, "id": "304976", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception"}, {"label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "id": "305872", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback"}, {"label": {"eng": "Columnist"}, "id": "314203", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columnist"}, {"label": {"eng": "Special teams"}, "id": "322846", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions#Special_teams"}, {"label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "id": "324224", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back"}, {"label": {"eng": "Passer rating"}, "id": "325480", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating"}, {"label": {"eng": "Punt (gridiron football)"}, "id": "325513", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(gridiron_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Thursday Night Football"}, "id": "330672", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday_Night_Football"}, {"label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}, "id": "335402", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens"}, {"label": {"eng": "Blitz (gridiron football)"}, "id": "340145", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitz_(gridiron_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Justin Tucker"}, "id": "341502", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Tucker"}, {"label": {"eng": "Joe Flacco"}, "id": "342533", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Flacco"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ryan Mallett"}, "id": "420986", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Mallett"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mallett"}, "id": "526360", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallett"}, {"label": {"eng": "Peter Schmuck"}, "id": "611814", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Schmuck"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bryn Renner"}, "id": "884195", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryn_Renner"}, {"label": {"eng": "Field goal"}, "id": "1268994", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal"}, {"label": {"eng": "Larry Donnell"}, "id": "1274899", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Donnell"}, {"label": {"eng": "Maxx Williams"}, "id": "1290335", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxx_Williams"}, {"label": {"eng": "Javorius Allen"}, "id": "1304200", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javorius_Allen"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 319, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1106, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup"}], "time": "02:30:00"}

Eleven days earlier, in the wake of a season-ending knee injury to starter Ryan Tannehill, Gase had persuaded Cutler to abandon his plans to begin a second career as a FOX Sports analyst. Now, in Miami's second preseason game, it was time to expose the team's new starting quarterback to live action.\n\n\"It's a fresh start for Jay, and that's exciting,\" Gase said. \"It's the start of our process with him, and he basically just got here. It's not necessarily how much of the offense he knows -- he knows it -- but he hasn't played in awhile. You get bodies around you and jump back into it, and it's a little bit of an adjustment. I'm anxious to see how it plays out.\"\n\nBy the time Cutler's short stint was done, Gase, along with 64,464 fans at Hard Rock Stadium, had seen enough to conclude that the Dolphins' passing attack is in capable hands. Though his stats were ho-hum -- Cutler completed three of six passes for 24 yards while generating no points in two series of action, en route to a 31-7 defeat to the Ravens -- the strong-armed quarterback looked firmly in command of the situation.\n\nHe also flashed his impressive skill set on one early play, racing to his right to avoid pressure and zipping a 31-yard, back-shoulder completion to receiver DeVante Parker. The play was called back due to a holding penalty on tackle Sam Young, but the message had been sent.\n\nIt was a heartening moment for Gase, who had success while working with Cutler as the Chicago Bears' offensive coordinator in 2015. That helped Gase land the Dolphins' job at season's end, and he guided the team to a surprising playoff berth in 2016.\n\nHowever, a late-season knee injury kept Tannehill from participating in the postseason, and when he further damaged his ACL during a training-camp practice earlier this month, Cutler emerged as the obvious fallback plan.\n\nOn Thursday, Gase became emotional while discussing the aftermath of Tannehill's injury, recalling a doctors' office scene the following day.\n\n\"I walked in and he was just crushed,\" Gase said, \"and the first thing Ryan said to me was, 'I let the team down. We're gonna be so good this year, and now I can't be out there.' I was like, 'Bro -- this is not on you.' But that's the kind of guy Ryan is.\"\n\nPredictably, Gase was not enthusiastic about the prospect of Cutler absorbing any undue punishment in his preseason debut. As he said before the game: \"I'll tell you this: If anyone hits him hard, I'm getting him out of there.\"\n\nSure enough, after Cutler took a shot from Ravens linebacker Za'Darius Smith on a third-and-11 incompletion with 7:55 remaining, landing on his throwing shoulder, his night was done. When the Dolphins got the ball back with 5:40 remaining in the first quarter, backup Matt Moore was the new quarterback.\n\nThough the Dolphins remain high on Moore, there's no doubt that their offensive fortunes will depend on Cutler's successful return. Gase, for one, is confident that the arrangement will be a fruitful one.\n\n\"I think Jay's comfortable here,\" Gase said, \"and he and I are comfortable together.

Parker has the size, quickness, hands and body control to be a true WR1.\n\n2016 stats: 56 rec., 90 targets, 744 yards, 4 TDs\n\nStats and trends: Cutler's big arm and aggressive approach stands to benefit Parker more so than teammate Jarvis Landry, a dynamic slot receiver used more in the short and intermediate game. ... Parker had foot surgery his final season at Louisville, which impacted the early outlook of some NFL teams. ... showed flashes of brilliance last season with big mid-season efforts at Los Angeles (8-79-1) and San Diego (5-103), but his target count was erratic from week to week. ... got four or fewer targets in seven of 16 games. ... he earned praise from Dolphins wide receivers coach Shawn Jefferson this month, according to the Miami Herald. ... \"Well I just think because when you see a guy like him with his talent, his movements, his lateral movement in his hips, and all (of those skills) like that, for a tall guy like that, DeVante has really loose hips,\" Jefferson told the Herald. \"He runs well without the ball. So he has all of those things that you look for in a top-flight receiver. He has that ability to affect the game, i.e. L.A. Rams last year.\"\n\nStrengths: Parker checks nearly every box of a No. 1 wide receiver in the NFL, and the offseason buzz is intensifying that he's a candidate to make the Year 3 leap in fantasy. ... he has experience under his belt and appears to be taking the game more seriously, which could be the final piece of the puzzle for unlocking his full potential. ... the move from Ryan Tannehill, who injured his knee in training camp, to Cutler might be a lateral move for Parker in a worst-case scenario and an upgrade in a best-case scenario.\n\nRisk factors: The case for his rise in fantasy is based on potential alone after he fizzled as a breakout pick once already. ... the injury to Tannehill might have yielded an opportunity for a quarterback in Cutler with a better style, but an overall downgrade in play. ... Tannehill isn't out for the season, either, and Cutler is in the early stages of preparing for his NFL return after a plan to jump in the broadcast booth in 2017. ... the Dolphins' run-first identity is still very much on the table and might be exaggerated with Cutler under center.\n\nVerdict: Parker might get more attention as August rolls on, but he warrants it. He has a real chance to improve his consistency going into his third season, which means far more than who his quarterback is.

But many, many more people are NOT fans of the Baltimore Ravens. This 2017 Deadspin NFL team preview is for those in the latter group. Read all the previews so far here.\n\nYour 2016 record: 8-8. The Steelers scored three touchdowns in the fourth quarter to eliminate you. Suck on that a little longer.\n\nYour coach: John Harbaugh, who used Tray Walker's funeral as an opportunity to bitch out De Smith for limited offseason player contact. You know what, you red ass? How about you find a decent training staff so that you're not in the top 3 of Injured Reserve every year instead?\n\nBy the way, I will always be entertained by Harbs's newfound obsession to exploit rules loopholes because of that one time the Pats fucked him in a playoff game with legally dubious formations. They broke his brain. You know damn well he spends all night guzzling coffee and poring over tape in a room covered with Beautiful Mind scribbles, eyebanging league bylaws to find something Belichick hasn't thought of yet. \"Intentional holding penalties! THAT'LL GET THEM! MWAHAHAHAHAHAH [lightning strikes in the background].\"\n\nYour quarterback: Joe Flacco, aka the world's finest Adam Levine Replacement Android. Flacco once bought 5 massage chairs and then got rid of them when he realized that he didn't like massage chairs, and that he is only one person. He's an idiot. Every year we get away from that Super Bowl victory, the more inexplicable his playoff success becomes. He must have taken the Limitless drug that winter or something.\n\nFlacco, as of this writing, is still out with a disc injury in his back. The Ravens don't think the injury is serious and expect him back for the opener but, as any 40-year-old man can tell you, EVERY disc injury is serious. That shit doesn't just go away, my friends. The uncertainty around Flacco means that he still could miss real playing time at some point, which means the team could probably use some reinforcements at the position, right? Hmmm, I wonder what free agent QB out there might help provide backup and fit in well with the rest of the team? I wonder who that could POSSIBLY be...\n\nI know this is beating an already-flayed horse, but the current backup is Ryan Mallett. Ryan Mallett is a beanstalk truant with atrocious career numbers. They just acquired Thad Lewis, who hasn't thrown an NFL pass in FOUR years. This team gets decimated by injuries year after year after fucking year. But your lounge singer of an owner won't sign Colin Kaepernick because he's afraid of losing beer money and insists on pandering to imaginary racist fans. What a complete pussy.\n\nI went to Annapolis once. In the Annapolis Harbor, you may catch a glimpse of Winning Drive, which is Steve Bisciotti's luxury yacht. Rumor has that it's the second largest yacht in that harbor, just after some bigtime doctor's launch, and that Bisciotti isn't exactly pleased with being No. 2. He's a butthole. PAY YOUR WATER BILL, COOKIE MAN.\n\nI care about the fan base but I have to absorb the opinions of the layers that have been there.\n\nSure buddy. LAYERS. There's a statue of a dude who obstructed justice in two murders right in front of your stadium. Glad the guy who gave up on finding the Ray Rice tape is suddenly so interested in conducting a comprehensive sociological study of his own fanbase. Accused domestic abuser and Uruk-hai chieftain Terrell Suggs is still on the roster, for God's sake.\n\nWhat's new that sucks: In their neverending quest to import every old wideout ever to play in the league, say hello to Jeremy Maclin, who's already destined to miss at least a quarter of the season. They also brought in anti-Kaepernick Danny Woodhead to appease all the layered opinion-havers among the Dundalk citizenry.\n\nWoodhead has played 21 games in the past three years. He has no chance with this Civil War infirmary of a team. They also grabbed Brandon Carr from the Cowboys, which will not stop them from allowing Antonio Brown to go for 150 yards against them twice a year.\n\nThe math guy quit. Dennis Pitta broke down. They signed Austin Howard to a $15 million deal and he reported to camp hurt. Zach Orr retired with half a neck and then unretired. No one who cares about him would ever let him return to this franchise.\n\n\"Your name is in my Bible.\" Even Jimmy Swaggart wasn't this big of a religious phony. This jackass retired ages ago and yet still manages to embarrass himself and his team on a yearly basis. I say we throw acid at that dumb statue.\n\nAs for Baltimore, it remains the most hilariously defensive city on the Eastern Seaboard. Your average Baltimore resident spends 10 hours a day scouring for ways to take umbrage at things. Here now is a typical conversation with any Baltimore resident:\n\nYOU: Hi, there.\n\nTHEM: WE'RE NOT JUST THE WIRE, YOU KNOW. ROGER GOODELL RIGS EVERY GAME FOR THE STEELERS. OH, YOU THINK YOU'RE BETTER THAN US JUST BECAUSE YOU LIVE IN A MORE INTERESTING CITY DO YOU? I'LL CUT YOU GOOD.\n\nThey're the original snowflakes, by God. One of the Deadspin staff's favorite hobbies is checking the Twitter feed of NFL access merchant Jason La Canfora, who tweets angry shit about the Orioles three times more often than he tweets out actual football information. It's the most Baltimore Twitter feed in history: just a string of anger spasms intended for no one in particular. Like Boston fans, Baltimore fans always assume you give a shit about their problems, and that you're always on their side. Neither of those things are true.\n\nWhat might not suck: For real, that yacht looks pretty sweet. I wouldn't kick it out of the docking slip.\n\nA couple of years ago I wrote you that the Ravens sucked because their kicker was named the team MVP. Guess what? The kicker was named the team MVP again last year.\n\nTom:\n\nBecause we're going to be 8-6, with 2 games to play, \"controlling our own destiny,\" and somehow find a way to blow it.\n\nGary:\n\nBecause we can play an entire season of games decided by three points or less and not a single one of those games will be even remotely exciting.\n\nLuis:\n\nJoe Flacco makes me sincerely regret the fact the Ravens won the 2012 Super Bowl. He's a case study on the hypothetical question of what if winning one championship meant you'd be rubbish for the rest of eternity.\n\nJason:\n\nWe are only slightly more effective at scouting/developing receivers than the Orioles are at scouting/developing starting pitching.\n\nJarren:\n\nThe last Ravens game I attended, I got aisle seats (this is relevant). About 5 minutes BEFORE the game, a stumbling drunk woman barfs a Sandlot-tobacco-carnival ride-level amount of spew all over about three steps, two rows behind me.\n\nAs the only decent human in the section, I warn ascending fans of the partially chewed hot dogs and now only slightly more acidic Bud Light Lime ahead of them. People behind the mess, however, intentionally distract those going down the stairs so that they will step in the puke, after which everyone in the section cheers. After struggling to find guest services' number, I text them to get the cleanup crew. When the cleanup man arrives, miserable, I ask how many texts they got. The answer was one. I wouldn't be surprised if there were people booing when the sawdust went down.\n\nDave:\n\nJoe Flacco will either throw the ball 80 yards down field or dump it off three feet in front of him immediately. There is no middle ground.\n\nDanny Woodhead will most likely finish the year with 185 catches for 325 yards.\n\nA friend of mine used to work for some entrepreneur clothier who provides high-end suits to Ravens players. Apparently Flacco said to him something along the lines of, \"That's great that you love what you do, hopefully one day I'll find something I'm passionate about.\"\n\nRyan:\n\nThis has to be the most boring team to watch on offense. I highly doubt any team has more three and outs over the last 7 years. Watching this team play on the road gives me a brain aneurysm every time. Harbs is one of the better coaches Monday - Saturday but if the opposing teams give him a wrinkle they didn't account for on Sunday, there is zero hope for any adjustments during the game to contest it. Our fans will pick a fight and then try to pull the victim card when they get their faces stomped in front of their family.\n\nI wish they would cut Michael Campanaro so he can go on to catch 15 TDs a year with the Pats. They have a $18 burger they sell at the stadium called the tailgater and it sums up this team perfectly, bad ideas and even worse execution. Fuck Anthony Wright for starting a playoff game in Ray & Ed's Prime.\n\nKeith:\n\nThis was something an acquaintance posted about 6 months after the actual incident, and right after the commissioner announced Rice had been suspended indefinitely. And at least 8 people liked it!\n\nAnd now today, multiple people I know from high school have been posting that they'll become Cowboys fans if the Ravens sign Kaepernick. We're the worst.\n\nWill:\n\nI have been to nearly every Ravens home game with my dad since they came to town. Last season I was going through the breakup of a 15-year relationship. The Ravens became my weekly escape - but only in the sense that I had an excuse to get blackout drunk by noon at age 35. I looked back through the schedule this morning, and literally cannot recall one memorable or significant moment from any game. My dad sold his tickets after last season - likely out of concern for my liver. We will be spending our Sundays doing something less mediocre this year.\n\nChris:\n\nLast year, the morning of the Ravens first preseason game, I had to endure a \"Ray Rice is not getting another shot because of double standards\" discussion first thing in the morning at work. Years ago, fellow colleagues almost laughed me out of the office for just suggesting that I'd rather have Matt Ryan than Joe Flacco. Cian Fahey pretty much summed up the Joe Flacco experience when he said \"It's not that he fails to read coverages, it's that he fails to realize the defense can call plays too. He throws the ball like he's surprised whenever there is a defender trying to cover one of his receivers.\"\n\nNews broke that Flacco could likely miss the first couple weeks of the regular season. I did a quick search to see who our backup QB was because I couldn't remember. I saw that it is Ryan Mallet, who is essentially a non-punctual and somehow crappier version of Joe Flacco. Good Times!\n\nJoe:\n\nSo you're interested joining the purple inbred brotherhood of Glen Burnie's finest? Well then friend, see if you qualify by taking the Ravens fan entrance exam!!\n\n1) Ray Lewis....\n\nA) Had a hand in killings those two guys\n\nB) Has a totally bitchin statue next to Johnny U out front of the stadium man! Well earned!!!\n\nC) Innocent from the start! The court system prevailed!!\n\nD) Are you guys really still talking about that? Move on already.\n\nE) BIG BEN IS A RAPIST!\n\n2) A Suggs jersey, fake purple hair wig, and purple camo pants (to tie the outfit together of course) is appropriate for:\n\nA) A Ravens game\n\nB) Any night out to a dinner and/or bar setting\n\nC) A wedding\n\nD) A technical exchange meeting with company shareholders to discuss 3rd quarter projections\n\nE) All of the above\n\n3) Is Joe Flacco elite?\n\nA) Yes\n\nB) Definitely, yes\n\nC) Absolutely! Now enough silly questions. Here, hit this pipe and let's get back to cornhole\n\nD) Hell yeah! And don't forget Trent Dilfer won a ring here too! That's two historically elite QBs! How many franchises can claim that?! You can honestly make a case that our two are better than Bradshaw and Ben.\n\n4) Discuss Ray Rice.\n\nA) He served his suspension and learned his lesson...seriously we should consider signing him to a league minimum deal. I mean it's been a couple years, but I'm sure he's well rested.\n\nB) There are guys in the league that have done MUCH worse! He's not Aaron Hernandez, let's give the guy a second chance!\n\nC) Look, it's never right to hit a woman...but man if a bitch come at you swinging like that, whatcha supposed to do? Just let her hit you??\n\nD) BIG BEN IS A RAPIST!\n\nANSWER KEY:\n\nPick one, any of them. Your answer doesn't matter. You're a Ravens fan and nothing you do matters. Now go get your fuckin' shinebox and fuck off back to Pasadena or Dundalk.\n\nJames:\n\nI still own my authentic Ray Rice jersey because I am convinced it will be worth money someday. I am an asshole.\n\nGary:\n\nAre we still relevant? Steve Smith is gone. Flacco is only going to get worse, our secondary is forever cursed, and I just read our resident genius John Urschel decided to retire. We're so fucked.\n\nJoseph:\n\nSo the fans must be on board with the idea bringing in Kap, right? Nope. You cruise the Facebook page of any (white) Ravens fan and you'll find plenty of comments like, \"DISGUSTING! I don't want to see him in OUR colors!\" or \"If he kneels during one of our games he better have extra security because our fans will BEAT HIS ASS!!!\" It's worth noting that Baltimore City served as the backdrop for civil unrest due to police brutality only a few years ago, but don't remind the county folk of that. Only Ravens fans could have their judgment so clouded by their racist underpinnings that they'd scoff at the idea of a halfway decent quarterback taking over for a few games.\n\nMike:\n\nEvery year my brother and I engage in the \"Is Flacco an elite quarterback?\" debate, and every year as we sit together and watch the games, I honestly can't believe he chose (and still passionately defends) the \"elite QB\" side of that argument.\n\nI can't believe that as a 32-y.o., 11-year veteran QB, Flacco still makes the same stupid mistakes he always has for the past 10 years in a row. He cannot throw deep with any accuracy at all so his \"big arm\" that the commentators talk about endlessly is useless. Whenever he throws long (usually on 3rd and short because that really catches the defense off guard, and for good reason), I usually just close my eyes because I know the only thing he's guaranteed to hit with that long pass is the grass.\n\nHe is unable to consistently hit the 5-7 yard passes over the middle that an offense needs to establish a rhythm, esp. one with as few offensive options as the Ravens. (There's a reason the Ravens routinely are in the top 5 in most 3-and-outs in the league every year.)\n\nAnd this has nothing to do with his \"lack of options\" or \"stability on the O line\" as my brother likes to use as an excuse, because Flacco was doing this shit when he had Ray Rice and multiple tight ends and wideouts at his disposal. The Ravens have changed their offensive coordinators a bunch but an elite QB should be able to work around that. For some reason Shit For Brains comes to life in the playoffs which I equate to a savant who can play the piano flawlessly but the rest of the time doesn't even know how to use an eyebrow trimmer. Perhaps we're seeing a new type of CTE manifest itself?\n\nTom:\n\nBeing a Baltimore Ravens fan means you have to defend the position that Joe Flacco is elite; a position not supported by any objective facts or statistics. You end up saying words like \"clutch\" or referring to obscure statistics that only Ravens fans know (i.e., most road playoff wins). Donald Fucking Trump said Joe Flacco is elite and, God forgive me, I liked the man for half a day.\n\nHaving to argue that Joe Flacco is elite is similar to having to argue that Qdoba is better than Chipotle just because Qdoba is closer to your house and doesn't have as long of a line. Qdoba is not better than Chipotle. The Ravens have spent the latter part of the off-season deciding whether our fan base can handle Colin Kapernick as QB. This is a fan base that gave Ray Rice a standing ovation after he punched out his girlfriend in a Vegas elevator.\n\nJesse:\n\nYou just get the feeling that since the Super Bowl, Flacco has just been killing time until he can dupe this god awful fan base into electing him to the Senate. Every spiritual felon in Dundalk who spent his entire life avoiding voting like the plague will cream his jeans the second he can vote for a real no nonsense, lunch pail kinda guy.\n\nAlso, Steve Bisciotti is Opus Dei weirdo who cheated employees out of billions. Nationalize his organs.\n\nMatt:\n\nFuck Lee Evans, Fuck Cundiff, and Fuck Steve Saunders with his new hard mode training camp, leaving a promising team looking like the first twenty minutes of Saving Private Ryan.\n\nDan:\n\nOver the past few seasons the Ravens have done the one thing in sports that's worse than sucking, they've become boring. You know how there are dog owners that sort of look like their dog, that's what happened with the Ravens. It's like we got the most boring milquetoast QB and the entire organization just decided to fall in line. From Ozzie looking dopier and dopier every year, to the boring Harbaugh brother, right on down the roster. We don't have anyone you'd want to sit down and have a conversation with, let alone that you'd want on your fantasy team. Flacco can throw it 60 yards on a frozen rope, and I'd bet my first born son Danny Woodhead leads the team in receiving this year. This organization is clown shoes, and if I hear \"In Ozzie we trust\" one more time I'd going to have an aneurysm.\n\nChristian:\n\nThe Ravens brought this Kapernick shit storm on themselves. Harbaugh brought his name up in a presser unprompted because it probably makes good football sense to have a backup that has started a damn Super Bowl. Then for the next two weeks when the press asks him about it, he coach speaks around everyone.\n\nFuck Billy Cundiff.\n\nTyler:\n\nI am a Ravens fan, and damn do I hate other Ravens fans. Did you know that, not only is Joe Flacco elite, he's better than Aaron Rodgers? In Baltimore, it's true. And Ray Lewis didn't kill anyone.\n\nDid you know that the Ravens should be Super Bowl favorites? Did you know it's because we're going to have the NFL's best three-man running back tandem (bet you can't name all three of them without looking) and the NFL's best defense? In Baltimore it's true, and the NFL is just biased against us.\n\nIn fact, did you know that the NFL has always been against us? That's why they let the Colts leave. That's why they made it so hard for us to get a team again. That's why they turned off the lights in the Super Bowl.\n\nRavens fans believe this shit. We gaslight ourselves. I hate the Ravens, I hate myself, and we belong together.\n\nHunter:\n\nThat there was even a discussion about whether these assholes would sign Kaepernick is a fucking hoot. Did anybody really think they would? After a few days of deliberation and consulting the team's icon and totally-sane-man-who-yells-in-empty-garages, the Ravens determined Kaepernick wouldn't be a good fit with the backwards fan base. Then pastor Ray-Ray took to Twitter to deliver an empty-as-ever sermon for Kap, his rendition of \"stick to sports.\" Fuck us. Kaepernick deserves much better. To the Ravens, it's a bigger problem to kneel during the national anthem than to be a domestic abuser. Fuck this organization, fuck it hard.\n\nCzech:\n\nThe Ravens are still operating under the mystique of the 2000 defense. Every year, they either draft a player or sign a random FA on the defensive side of the ball, and suddenly it's the greatest defense in the history of the league. They haven't been able to cover a top WR for the last 5 years, and that might be generous. So, this season, they brought in the top safety available (after bringing in Weddle last year), and spent a first rounder on a cornerback as well. Of course, this has already led to purple camo wearing mouth-breathers to declare this defense unstoppable, and the Ravens are going to be back in the playoffs, etc, etc.\n\nOf course, in doing all of the above to help out the secondary, we completely ignored the gaping hole at WR, and on the right side of the OL. In the first week of OTAs, we lost the starting nickel CB for the year, and then 70% of the offense disappeared when Pitta dislocated his hip for the third (and final) time. 86 receptions, Flacco's safety valve, and the pace of the offense just evaporated. But don't worry, we have Danny Woodhead now, and 87-year-old Ben Watson coming off of a major injury (he's now timed with a sundial). We have two receivers who only see success running as fast as they can down the field (Perriman and Wallace), so of course all the fans were shitting their dicks at the chance to sign Jeremy Maclin, who is exactly the same as those two and would no sooner go toward the middle than Trump would.\n\nHopefully, the front office realizes they need someone capable (and willing) to run intermediate patterns, and defined routes other than \"sprint as fast as you can and hope you get interfered with\" (which was Torrey Smith's entire career, have fun Eagles fans). Flacco will do the same disinterested trot on and off the field, whether it's his eighth 3-and-out of the day, or a 13 play, 87 yard scoring drive.\n\nThe defense will start strong and fade, as it does every year, as being on the field all the time and getting beat up wears out anyone. Maybe with all the money in the secondary they won't give up touchdown leads in the three games they manage to score more than four field goals this season. Crabcakes and Football, that's what Maryland does! Only, 90% of the time, both of them are nothing but filler and the rest of the country can't figure out why those around the Chesapeake think it's so great (but nothing does beat a good crabcake!).\n\nJeremy:\n\nFuck Lee Evans with Ray Lewis' I-didn't-do-it knife and a pair of those awful gold pants", "id": "9751158", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Why Your Team Sucks

Ajayi, a Pro Bowl selection last season after rushing for 1,272 yards, got out of the NFL's concussion protocol Tuesday after participating in non-contact practice drills the previous few days.

Starting right tackle Ja'Wuan James has been nursing a shoulder injury and did not play, and guard-center Kraig Urbik, who is nursing a back ailment, also sat out.\n\nDefensively, Mike Hull started at middle linebacker. The Dolphins, who lost rookie second-round pick Raekwon McMillan to a knee injury a week ago against Atlanta, are thought to be in the market for another linebacker.

But the fault lay more with rookie receiver Quincy Adeboyejo, who allowed Dolphins cornerback Xavien Howard to seize inside position on a deep route and later let cornerback Cordrea Tankersley rip the ball out of his hands.\n\nSo all in all, Mallett wasn't as bad as his 50 passer rating might indicate.\n\nThat said, the offense still did not find anything resembling a consistent flow, and we still didn't see much from the team's front-line receivers. Jeremy Maclin, for example, was targeted just once for a five-yard gain.\n\nMallett isn't accurate enough possession to possession for the team's skill players to flourish.\n\nSignificant evolution is unlikely as long as he's starting, which makes these games frustrating to watch. But with Joe Flacco out until the season opener, we're on hold trying to judge this offense.\n\n2) The middle of the Ravens defense continues to look awesome.\n\nThe best Ravens defenses have featured a wall of beef up front. Just ask Ray Lewis how much Sam Adams and Tony Siragusa meant to him during the team's first Super Bowl season.\n\nWell, with 340-pound Brandon Williams now regularly lining up beside 340-pound Michael Pierce, the 2017 defense has that vintage look.\n\nThe Dolphins managed just 13 rushing yards on seven attempts before most of the Ravens' starting defenders exited the game. And they looked particularly helpless whenever they tried to go up the gut.\n\nWilliams and Pierce made a pair of tackles each, and they facilitated others with the space they cleared.\n\nWe still don't know if the Ravens will consistently menace opposing quarterbacks. They'll need to do that to become a memorable defensive team. But they have the bedrock.\n\n3) For Ryan Jensen, not standing out has been good news.\n\nThe Ravens played without their two best offensive linemen, Marshal Yanda and Ronnie Stanley, so it wasn't surprising to watch them struggle up front at times.\n\nOn a positive note, Jensen appears to be a viable starter at center. It's always hard to grade blockers without studying the game film, but whenever I zeroed in on Jensen, he came off the snap with a decisive burst. And he hasn't struggled getting the ball cleanly into Mallett's hands.\n\nSuch competence is reassuring from a player who's started just nine career games, none of them at center.\n\nAfter last season, coach John Harbaugh and general manager Ozzie Newsome said they wanted the line to get bigger and stronger. So Jensen got off on the right foot by reporting to summer practices heavier and fitter than he'd been in 2016. Even before John Urschel retired, he seemed the favorite to win the center job.\n\nGiven the season-ending injury to left guard Alex Lewis and the team's reported interest in bringing back veteran center Jeremy Zuttah, it's conceivable Jensen could end up at guard rather than center. Regardless, he's risen significantly in the team's pecking order.\n\n4) The jury is still out on the Ravens' young pass rushers.\n\nWith Terrell Suggs entering his 15th season and Elvis Dumervil gone, the Ravens invested heavily in their future pass rush in the 2017 draft.\n\nBetween rookie linebackers Tyus Bowser and Tim Williams and second-year projected started Matthew Judon, they believe they finally have the right young players to complement Suggs.\n\nBut we didn't see much production from the trio in Miami, at least not until Williams came off the end for a sack in the waning moments of the game.\n\nWilliams, perhaps the purest pass rusher of the group, was disappointed in his performance the previous week. Perhaps the sack will get him back on track after a few weeks of inconsistent play in practice.\n\nHe'll need to do more to earn playing time during the regular season.\n\nThat's not the case for Judon. And Bowser also seems in line to play regularly because of his versatility. But the youth brigade at outside linebacker will bear watching all season, because they could be the difference between a very good defense and a great one.\n\nThe Ravens have gone a whole generation without drafting and developing a star pass rusher. They need one of these guys to flip that narrative.\n\n5) Josh Woodrum is preseason football.\n\nGet ready for a week of fans calling for Woodrum to shove aside Mallett as the team's primary backup quarterback.\n\nThat's not happening for the former Liberty star, despite two near-flawless performances against third- and fourth-stringers\n\nBut if there's anything I like about watching exhibition football (and there isn't much), it's the mini-sensations who emerge in junk time.\n\nWoodrum was cut before he ever got to play in the preseason last summer. But he's giving it another go, and there he was Thursday night, running for touchdowns and connecting with tight end Maxx Williams on a 40-yard pass.\n\nMaybe a few quarters worth of well-timed scampers and accurate passes will earn Woodrum a spot on the Baltimore practice squad or with a different organization. We see it happen for a few guys every year, and that justifies the existence of these games.\n\nchilds.walker@baltsun.com\n\ntwitter.com/childswalker", "id": "9867699", "details": {}, "date":

Baltimore opened as a 2.5-point underdog, and go figure, our consensus reports show roughly 60 percent of bettors putting the Ravens in their preseason NFL picks. That's against the spread; the moneyline has almost everyone taking Baltimore at +135. Shall we join them?\n\nBetting against Harbaugh doesn't seem like a good idea. He was born into a football family, and he takes the sport very seriously - maybe even to the detriment of his own team, given how many man-games the Ravens have lost to injury over the years. They started the 2017 preseason by dismantling Washington 23-3, cashing in as 2-point home dogs. And they lost another player: starting LG Alex Lewis is gone for the year with a torn labrum.\n\nThis is going to bite the Ravens come the regular season; they've already seen rookie OG Nico Siragusa tear multiple knee ligaments in training camp, while John Urschel, who was competing for the starting center role, decided math was more important than football and retired just before camp opened. Score one for spectral graph theory. There are plenty more injuries on top of that - including QB Joe Flacco, who's sitting out the preseason with a sore back. But they shouldn't affect the Ravens too much on Thursday with their bloated exhibition roster.\n\nSo how does Adam Gase approach the preseason? We've got a short sample size to work with, but Gase told reporters on Tuesday that training camp is \"meant to be hard,\" and his Dolphins have had more than their share of injuries getting ready for 2017. QB Ryan Tannehill is out with a torn knee; Jay Cutler will reportedly make his Miami debut against Baltimore after being lured out of retirement to replace Tannehill. RBs Jay Ajayi and Kenyan Drake both suffered concussions. OG Ted Larsen is on injured reserve with a torn biceps.\n\nAt least Cutler and Gase will be familiar with each other from their time with the Chicago Bears. Cutler had a fine 2015 season with Gase as his offensive coordinator, then imploded after Gase left for Miami. It remains to be seen how much playing time Cutler will get Thursday - maybe he'll get an extended look after missing the preseason opener. It's something to think about before auto-betting the Ravens.\n\nAs for the moneyline, that's definitely an option with the Ravens at +2.5, but as we go to press, many of the sportsbooks on our NFL odds board have Baltimore at +3 (-115). That's a valuable half-point, even if five cents worth of vigorish has been shaved off. Moving from +2.5 to +3 is worth about 21 cents according to the \"fair price\" list at Wizard of Odds. Given these odds and the injuries on both sides, we're even more encouraged to recommend the Ravens for Thursday's preseason NFL picks - for a small wager, in case the Adam Gase-Jay Cutler Era turns out to be a thing.", "id": "9806712", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Preseason NFL picks: Cash in on the Ravens in Miami", "image": "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?&url=https://fansided.com/wp-content/uploads/getty-images/2017/08/627709270-miami-dolphins-v-baltimore-ravens.jpg.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "189313", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "242096", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "id": "302552", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sport"}, "id": "302606", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Head coach"}, "id": "305436", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach"}, {"label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}, "id": "305439", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "id": "305661", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "id": "305872", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mathematics"}, "id": "309862", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Football League preseason"}, "id": "314202", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_preseason"}, {"label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "id": "324224", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back"}, {"label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}, "id": "331328", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins"}, {"label": {"eng": "John Harbaugh"}, "id": "335401", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harbaugh"}, {"label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}, "id": "335402", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adam Gase"}, "id": "341272", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Gase"}, {"label": {"eng": "Injured reserve list"}, "id": "342457", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_reserve_list"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}, "id": "342459", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears"}, {"label": {"eng": "Joe Flacco"}, "id": "342533", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Flacco"}, {"label": {"eng": "Odds"}, "id": "354512", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jay Cutler (American football)"}, "id": "355416", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Cutler_(American_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ryan Tannehill"}, "id": "364505", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Tannehill"}, {"label": {"eng": "John Urschel"}, "id": "398285", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Urschel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spectral graph theory"}, "id": "463798", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_graph_theory"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vigorish"}, "id": "849993", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigorish"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jay Ajayi"}, "id": "1270836", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Ajayi"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 31, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 447, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 710, "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 811, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 829, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football"}], "time": "13:32:00"}

Below are four Ravens to watch for during the game:\n\n1. Brent Urban\n\nHe completely took Ravens Nation by storm after his extremely impressive preseason debut against Washington. Two questions on everybody's mind is; can he build upon his impressive performance and can he continue this level of play during the regular season?\n\nThe Ravens front seven was a powerful force in the 23-3 win over Washington. How will this unit rebound after such a dominating performance? Urban is battling to be the starting defensive end and he is certainly winning this competition, thus far. Will he be able to stay at the top? This Baltimore Beatdown writer thinks so.\n\n2. Jaylen Hill\n\nHe is trying to continue the Ravens long tradition of having at least one UDFA make the final 53-man roster. His performance against Washington exhibited his ability to earn a roster spot. Hill was all over the field, making several impressive open-field tackles and he had one interception late in the first-half that led to a Justin Tucker field goal.\n\n3. Marlon Humphrey\n\nThe Ravens 2017 first-round pick will make his preseason debut on Thursday night and he will certainly have everyone's attention. Humphrey has turned heads with strong performances during OTA's and training camp but when the lights are the brightest, will he perform?\n\n4. Kamalei Correa\n\nHe is battling with Patrick Onwuasor for the starting inside linebacker job alongside C.J. Mosley. The battle is fairly close and Onwuasor did have a strong preseason game against Washington. Correa will need to continue to prove he is capable of replacing Zachary Orr. His performance against Washington was not the flashiest nor did he light up the stat sheet, but he was efficient.

I don't know if [Pughsley] is going to be the right guard as the starter. To see those guys get in there and do OK was good to see.\"\n\nIt was Howard's first game as a Raven, and he held up well. Howard is still getting adjusted to the Ravens' terminology and getting back into game shape following offseason shoulder surgery, but performed well in his debut.\n\n\"Austin, he's got to work his way back.

He was forced to left tackle with Ronnie Stanley (unspecified) out with a non-serious injury, and also played well.\n\nHurst and undrafted rookie defensive lineman Patrick Ricard (yes, a defensive tackle playing fullback) had a nice seal block that helped Javorius Allen break a 14-yard gallop.\n\nThe bulk of the Ravens' issues came up the middle, however.\n\nPughsley, who the Ravens added to their practice squad midway through last year, has limited experience despite this being his fourth season in the league. He's played in two career games. He struggled with giving up interior push twice on early drives.\n\nSkura and Jensen got pushed backward on back-to-back losses on running plays by Terrance West, which went for losses of 2 and 4 yards, respectively.\n\nThe Ravens rushed for just 50 yards in the first half overall. West, who ran five times for 23 yards and a touchdown in the preseason opener, had six runs for minus-2 yards in Miami. Allen had the most success in the first half, running six times for 23 yards.\n\nThe Ravens are thin along the interior after they lost starting left guard Alex Lewis (shoulder) and reserve lineman Nico Siragusa (knee) to season-ending injuries. John Urschel, who was competing for the starting center job, retired a few hours before the start of training camp.\n\n\"It's not ideal, obviously. You've got to play the hand you're dealt,\" Harbaugh said. \"You look around the NFL, everybody has something [wrong]. It seems every team gets hit in one spot; we've been hit on the offensive line. It wasn't a real deep position for us anyway, then John retired; that was a real surprise.\n\n\"I think the guys are managing it right. You use what you have and make the best of it and see where you get; it can make you tougher and stronger and all those kind of things. I'm really proud of the way they're working at it and making it what we can. I think we're going to be a good offensive line before it's all said and done.\"\n\nBaltimore is reportedly \"close\" to re-signing Jeremy Zuttah, who they traded to the San Francisco 49ers earlier this offseason and was subsequently released last week. Zuttah would help give the offensive line more depth and an experienced starter who knows the Ravens offense.", "id": "9828773", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "John Harbaugh: Offensive Line 'OK' Given Circumstances ", "image": "http://prod.static.ravens.clubs.nfl.com//assets/images/imported/BAL/news-articles/2017/08-August/03/17_Oline_news.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "182034", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}, "id": "302611", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown"}, {"label": {"eng": "Defensive lineman"}, "id": "305435", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(American_football)#Defensive_line"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "id": "305661", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Center (American and Canadian football)"}, "id": "311351", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(American_and_Canadian_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}, "id": "312085", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(American_and_Canadian_football)#Defensive_tackle"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rookie"}, "id": "313674", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}, "id": "316239", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup"}, {"label": {"eng": "Guard (American and Canadian football)"}, "id": "322621", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(American_and_Canadian_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Offensive line"}, "id": "324464", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_line"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fullback (American football)"}, "id": "325507", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullback_(American_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}, "id": "329201", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_team"}, {"label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}, "id": "331328", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins"}, {"label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}, "id": "335402", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrance West"}, "id": "389292", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrance_West"}, {"label": {"eng": "John Urschel"}, "id": "398285", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Urschel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Marshal Yanda"}, "id": "401155", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshal_Yanda"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ryan Jensen (fighter)"}, "id": "463797", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Jensen_(fighter)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Patrick Ricard"}, "id": "1147513", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Ricard"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}, "id": "1269622", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ronnie Stanley"}, "id": "1281007", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Stanley"}, {"label": {"eng": "Javorius Allen"}, "id": "1304200", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javorius_Allen"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 49, "label": "dmoz/Games", "uri": "dmoz/Games"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 52, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1009, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Multiplayer", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Multiplayer"}], "time": "01:14:00"}

Cutler's first throw was to Jay Ajayi which resulted in a first down. Ajayi actually started the game after coming back from a concussion.\n\nCutler only played two drives and wen 3 of 6 for 24. He honestly wasn't that bad. He and DeVante Parker had a big play called back due to a holding penalty. Ajayi also only played for two drives. The running back also had a big play called back to another holding penalty.\n\nNeither Cutler or Matt Moore had much of a chance behind that offensive line. There seemed to be constant pressure and it forced the quarterbacks to either throw early or get out of the pocket. This line needs Mike Pouncey to succeed. Moore only played one series.\n\nByron Maxwell and the first team defense had a pretty good showing. Maxwell forced two fumbles and the defense was able to stop the Ravens. Mike Hull made a stop on forth down near midfield which turned the ball over to the Dolphins. Hull saw some extended time as the linebacker is expected to start now. Xavien Howard also recorded an interception as the second year player is expected to contribute a lot this season. Devon Godchaux got the start over Jordan Phillips.\n\nWith the second/third team offense in, led by David Fales, the Dolphins were able to score first thanks to a Senorise Perry 11-yard touchdown run. Isaac Asiata had a nice block and Perry broke a few tackles. However, Perry handled a kickoff return and gave the ball away as he fumbled the ball in the second quarter.\n\nDolphins special teams in the first half was...bad. Perry had the fumble,Matt Darr had a punt blocked, and the return unit had a holding penalty. Darren Rizzi will not be pleased.\n\nCordrea Tankersley recorded an interception as he took the ball out of the receivers hands. Rookie draft picks such as Tankersley, Godchaux, and Vincent Taylor made some plays on defense, which had to make Chris Grier and Mike Tannenbaum feel good.\n\nThe Dolphins played some sloppy football. There were penalties and poor play but thankfully none of the starters got injured.

And then center John Urschel retired the morning he was supposed to report to the training facility, rookie guard Nico Siragusa suffered a gruesome knee injury in practice that will sideline him all season, and promising second-year guard Alex Lewis was ruled out for the year due to shoulder surgery. Making matters worse, crucial left tackle Ronnie Stanley has been held out of practice all week with a mystery ailment.\n\nThe Ravens offense is a mess right now. Quarterback Joe Flacco has yet to see the practice field while he recovers from a back injury. Key receiver Breshad Perriman is dealing with another lingering lower body injury and elusive back Kenneth Dixon is done for the year because of a knee surgery. The offensive line is in a daily state of flux, with blockers forced to play out of position and basically zero quality depth. Developmental lineman Jermaine Eluemunor, De'Ondre Wesley and Stephane Nembot all showed a concerning lack of quickness in the preseason opener. Thankfully, recent veteran signee Austin Howard has been cleared to practice and should bring stability to the right tackle position alongside All-Pro Marshal Yanda.\n\nFortunately for Baltimore, they share concerns about their offensive line with the vast majority of the league. There was a dearth of quality line play throughout the NFL last season, and the situation was not improved by one of the weakest rookie classes in memory. This scarcity of capable lineman is the reason slightly better than average blockers such as former Raven Ricky Wagner was offered a $47.5 million contract in free agency.\n\nLooking at the Ravens regular season slate, the arch rival Steelers are the only scheduled opponent with proven commodities at every position on their line from left to right. The Titans and Packers each boast Pro Bowl caliber bookend tackles, but also questions on the interior. The Browns and Raiders are vulnerable at right tackle, and also dealing with injuries and holdouts, respectively. Chicago has a trio of elite interior blockers, but below average tackles.\n\nIf Laremy Tunsil can live up to his potential at left tackle, Miami will be strong on the outside and at center, yet still below average at both guard spots. The loss of Taylor Decker in Detroit, who is on the PUP list following shoulder surgery, is a huge blow to an already questionable unit. If Stanley's injury is indeed a short term issue, the Ravens line is honestly better than the other five opponents remaining on their schedule - Cincinnati, Jacksonville, Minnesota, Houston and Indianapolis.\n\nAll in all, the Ravens should trot out an average at worst offensive line in comparison to their peers if Ryan Jensen continues to perform well at center and the Ravens are past their injuries. This bodes well for a team that possesses the defensive talent to win regular season wars of attrition. The lack of competent lineman has forced offensive coordinators to alter their schemes through a variety of measures designed to work around poor blocking. However, after the Ravens front office finally focused on upgrading the secondary, the defense is well equipped to shut down any offensive gameplan.\n\nJudging by their unusual aggressiveness in the first preseason contest, head coach John Harbaugh and defensive coordinator Dean Pees are fully aware that they will need a dominant defense to compensate for their offense this season. No matter how the Ravens offensive line performs, the team's impressive defensive front can ensure the team wins the overall battle for control of the line of scrimmage by consistently whipping the blockers they face, week in and week out. The quest to build a truly imposing defense continues tonight in Miami.", "id": "9715818", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Baltimore is not the only team with serious questions about

Stats don't show how much offense struggled. Get ready for tight, low-scoring games this season. Undrafted CB Jaylen Hill looks like one to keep.\n\nFive thoughts on the Ravens' 31-7 win over the Miami Dolphins Thursday night at Hard Rock Stadium:\n\nDefense Continues to Live Up to Hype\n\nBetween Jay Cutler's Miami debut and an up-tempo, no-huddle approach, the Dolphins threw a lot more at the Ravens' starting defense than it saw in the preseason opener. The defense was more than up to the test, allowing no points on three possessions before backups began filtering onto the field. Cutler did complete one long pass that was nullified by a penalty, and no doubt, four Miami penalties in the early going made things easier for the defense. But let's not quibble. For the second straight week, Baltimore's starting unit was dominant, shutting down the opponents' running game and using a blend of schemes to apply consistent pressure and disrupt the quarterback's rhythm. If a few series in two August games are any measure, the Ravens' 2017 defense is going to be, as advertised, a handful.\n\nStats Don't Show How Much Offense Struggled\n\nWith Mike Wallace, Jeremy Maclin and Danny Woodhead playing for the first time, the Ravens hoped to see more from Ryan Mallett and the starting offense. By the end of the first half, the offense had put up 13 points and 163 yards -- decent numbers. But those numbers disguised the fact that the offense struggled for most of the half. The running game produced little and never found a rhythm. Mallett tossed two interceptions, although, in his defense, the inexperience of a rookie receiver contributed to both. The offensive line, a patchwork group featuring four players who began their careers as undrafted rookies, protected Mallett nicely but struggled to open holes for runners and was flagged for three holding penalties. The offense did move the ball better as the first half unfolded, and it did manage to push the ball into the end zone after a blocked punt gave it the ball at the Miami 4-yard line.\n\nGet Ready for Tight, Low-Scoring Games This Season\n\nWith the defense looking good and starting quarterback Joe Flacco out until the regular season opener because of a back injury, it's fair to suggest the Ravens' early games might be tight, low-scoring affairs. If so, they'll need quality play from their special teams, one of their strengths in recent years. On this hot summer night in Florida, those special teams gave a vintage performance that suggested they are ready for the challenge. Justin Tucker nailed three field goals, including a 52-yarder, and also recovered a fumbled kickoff. Wide receiver Chris Matthews, battling for a roster spot, had the biggest play, blocking a punt to set up a touchdown in the second quarter. More quietly, but just as importantly, while Baltimore's kick and punt returners had little chance to show their stuff, they did handle all chances flawlessly, unlike Miami's returners, who seemingly bobbled balls all night. What's that old saying? If you don't lose the game, you're halfway to winning it.\n\nUndrafted CB Jaylen Hill Looks Like One to Keep\n\nOne of the big stories heading into the game was the expected pro debut of Marlon Humphrey, the Ravens' 2017 first-round pick, who sat out the preseason opener. That debut came quickly when starting cornerback Jimmy Smith had a helmet issue on the game's second play, forcing Humphrey to hustle onto the field and play a snap. He didn't end up playing a whole lot, though, then took off his pads at halftime, signaling the end of his night. As the game unfolded, another rookie cornerback, far less heralded, wound up becoming the story. Jaylen Hill, an undrafted free agent from Jacksonville State, had a second straight strong game. According to Pro Football Focus, the Dolphins threw at him five times, but completed just one pass for 2 yards. It's still early, but Hill is looking more and more like a player the Ravens will want to keep.\n\nQuick Hits\n\nLardarius Webb seemingly has the inside track on the slot cornerback job. He lined up with the starters in the first quarter and contributed a sack that was nullified by a penalty ... Rookie defensive lineman Patrick Ricard, trying to make the team as an undrafted free agent, ran several plays from the fullback position. He's facing a numbers battle in his bid for a roster spot, but the coaches love his motor and athleticism ... Avoiding injuries is always a priority in preseason games, and it became more of a priority Thursday night once the game began and the playing field began coming up in chunks, giving it the appearance of a lawn that had just been aerated ... The coaches gave rookie Ricky Ortiz more looks at fullback than Lorenzo Taliaferro ... Maxx Williams, coming off knee surgery and quiet so far at training camp, had a breakout performance with a pair of run-and-catch plays totaling 48 yards. It's time to re-insert him in the tight end conversation.", "id": "9828776", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "The Breakdown: Eisenberg's Five Thoughts vs. Miami Dolphins ", "image":

After the first preseason game against the Washington Redskins and injuries occurred, I deliver my second projection.\n\nNothing changes here. Josh Woodrum has not beat out Mallett, though he did pass Dustin Vaughan, who was cut from the Ravens earlier this week.\n\nTerrance West\n\nDanny Woodhead\n\nJavorius Allen\n\nI still like Javorius Allen as the third tailback on the roster. His special teams value keeps him aboard. He and Taquan Mizzell are in a battle right now; watch for them to duke it out across these next few preseason games.\n\nLorenzo Taliaferro\n\nI'm unsure if the Ravens even keep Lorenzo, but I still have him here due to the Ravens love of fullback utilization.\n\nJeremy Maclin\n\nMike Wallace\n\nBreshad Perriman\n\nMichael Campanaro\n\nQuincy Adeboyejo\n\nChris Moore\n\nChris Moore takes the spot I previously gave to Tim White. I haven't been impressed with Moore's play thus far, but he is a draft pick and if Tim White is no longer on the team, Moore clearly makes the roster.\n\nChanges here, as I disclude Stephane Nembot. I don't believe he is the spare tackle for the Ravens. They'll go towards a free-agent, if they need yet another tackle.\n\nMarshal Yanda\n\nDe'Ondre Wesley\n\nMultiple players listed as tackle or center, also play guard. Hence why this list is low.\n\n'Z' is the new addition on my roster. Though Judon surpassed him in the depth chart, his pass rush looks better than Williams', currently.\n\nPrice is the new addition, and Brandon Boykin is no longer on this list. Boykin's missed several practices; meanwhile, Sheldon has returned and is working hard.\n\nEric Weddle\n\nTony Jefferson\n\nLardarius Webb\n\nAnthony Levine Sr.\n\nChuck Clark\n\nAdded Clark to the safety list. He was my final addition, after sorting pieces around. The Ravens don't have a young group here, outside of Jefferson.

Ryan Mallett gets a stronger supporting cast. Mallett, who continues to fill in for Joe Flacco (back), is looking to bounce back after a rough preseason opener. He completed half of his passes (9 of 18) and averaged a dreadful 3.2 yards per attempt. Mallett continues to lack touch, missing wildly on his throws downfield. Thursday night should be a better evaluation because his top two receivers (Jeremy Maclin and Mike Wallace) are expected to play, along with running back Danny Woodhead.\n\n2. Defense looks to build on dominating cameo. The Ravens will face Jay Cutler in his first game with the Dolphins, and they'll look to dominate just like they did last week against Kirk Cousins. Baltimore stifled Washington's first-team offense to the tune of minus-1 yard on six plays. \"We have not proved anything yet,\" defensive coordinator Dean Pees said. \"We played good for three series. That is what we have proven. We are so far away from being where we need to be to play a season and really be the kind of defense that we want to be.\"\n\n3. Marlon Humphrey makes his debut. The rookie first-round pick has been impressive with his composure and aggressive play. Humphrey, drafted No. 16 overall, will try to carry over that strong camp into his first game. (He didn't play in the preseason opener because of an undisclosed injury.) \"It will be fun to see,\" coach John Harbaugh said. \"He has had another good week of practice. Seeing the game reps will be a big step for him.\"\n\n4. Who will take the lead at returner? Tim White was Baltimore's primary returner until the undrafted rookie suffered a season-ending thumb injury in the preseason opener. It looks like the competition will be between Michael Campanaro and Keenan Reynolds. Campanaro averaged 12.6 yards per punt last season, and Reynolds broke a 46-yard punt return. \"I think coach Jerry [Rosburg, the special-teams coordinator/associate head coach] knows he can trust me back there -- just fielding the ball and making plays,\" Campanaro said.\n\n5. Offensive line continues to shuffle. The Ravens' blockers up front remain in flux. There will be different players at four of the five positions along the line. Left tackle Ronnie Stanley is out with an undisclosed injury, and right tackle Austin Howard gets in his first game with Baltimore. Pro Bowl right guard Marshal Yanda (offseason shoulder surgery) is expected to play after sitting out the preseason opener, and Matt Skura shifts from right to left guard. Only center Ryan Jensen will be at the same spot for the first two preseason games. \"Sure, we would rather have them all set and working on their spots,\" Harbaugh said. \"But that has not been the case. That is just the way it has worked out at that position.\"", "id": "9676206", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Ryan Mallett should get good shot to rebound in second preseason game", "image": "http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0815%2Fr244870_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "189313", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}, "id": "311051", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator"}, {"label": {"eng": "Offensive tackle"}, "id": "321593", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(American_and_Canadian_football)#Offensive_tackle"}, {"label": {"eng": "Guard (American and Canadian football)"}, "id": "322621", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(American_and_Canadian_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "id": "324224", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}, "id": "324397", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl"}, {"label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}, "id": "331328", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins"}, {"label": {"eng": "John Harbaugh"}, "id": "335401", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harbaugh"}, {"label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}, "id": "335402", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens"}, {"label": {"eng": "Joe Flacco"}, "id": "342533", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Flacco"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kirk Cousins"}, "id": "351349", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Cousins"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jay Cutler (American football)"}, "id": "355416", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Cutler_(American_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Return specialist"}, "id": "369721", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_specialist"}, {"label": {"eng": "Marshal Yanda"}, "id": "401155", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshal_Yanda"}, {"label": {"eng": "Danny Woodhead"}, "id": "409986", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Woodhead"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ryan Mallett"}, "id": "420986", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Mallett"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jeremy Maclin"}, "id": "443422", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Maclin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dean Pees"}, "id": "491894", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Pees"}, {"label": {"eng": "Austin Howard"}, "id": "520939", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Howard"}, {"label": {"eng": "Keenan Reynolds (American football)"}, "id": "1276294", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keenan_Reynolds_(American_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ronnie Stanley"}, "id": "1281007", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Stanley"}, {"label": {"eng": "Michael Campanaro"}, "id": "1317880", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Campanaro"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 52, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 134, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 137, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}], "time": "11:36:00"}

Indeed, Adam Gase's team didn't lose anyone, period, which one hopes turns into something of a trend the remainder of this preseason.\n\nBut this game, unproductive on offense and a disaster for the special teams, did serve the wonderful purpose of perhaps giving you a glimpse of how the Dolphins might have to play if they're going to win games early in the regular season.\n\nThat is to say, Miami is going to have to win on defense.\n\nWe'll get to the defense in a minute. Let's take care of the business you care about. Let's talk offense.\n\nThe unit is not ready for the regular season. And that's fine, it can be argued, because the regular season isn't dawning tomorrow. But with the regular season only three weeks away, this offense seems light-years from being, you know, any good.\n\nJay Cutler, the team's new starting quarterback, isn't ready. He may have all this experience in Gase's offense and a gifted arm, and the drop from Ryan Tannehill to him might be negligible. But he's rusty. And he's not very mobile. And it's painfully obvious he's playing with guys he doesn't know and who don't know him too well.\n\nCutler completed 3 of 6 passes for 24 yards in two series of work Thursday night. He was rushed. He was hit. He did what new quarterbacks do a lot which is he looked to the check-down throw for help.\n\nWhen Cutler did unleash his powerful throwing arm, he completed a beautiful throw to DeVante Parker for 31 yards. He showed his pocket sense by stepping up confidently to find a lane and make his throw. It was very good.\n\nBut the truth about that play is Cutler threw into double coverage. And his offensive line, which is not anywhere close to being ready for the season, drew a penalty to erase the play anyway.\n\nThe Dolphins' starting offensive line, by the way, has not been seen together this preseason or in training camp yet.\n\nMike Pouncey rightly didn't play Thursday, and he's the starting center. Ja'Wuan James, nursing a sore shoulder, rightly didn't play, and he's the starting right tackle. Kraig Urbik, nursing a sore back, rightly didn't play, and he's the most likely candidate to start at left guard.\n\nSo it was no surprise that starting running back Jay Ajayi rushed once for minus-2 and had a 19-yard gain erased by an offensive lineman's holding penalty.\n\nThe offensive line accounted for three penalties -- two holding calls against Sam Young and a false start by Laremy Tunsil.\n\nLook, it's the preseason, so any hot take I could share here should be understood in the context of a small sample size and concerning players that might not be starting when the real games begin. But the Ravens are going to have a nice defense early in 2017. And that showed when they played the Dolphins' starting offense Thursday.\n\nYeah, I'm kidding. The Miami special teams were a disaster. They had a fumble on a kickoff return, and then the Ravens blocked a Matt Darr punt. So the special teams looked worse than Miami's uninspired offense in the first half.\n\nThe Dolphins defense was good. It held Baltimore starting quarterback Ryan Mallett to a 25.7 passer rating on 3 of 6 passing.\n\nXavien Howard, who is showing signs he's going to be a force in the AFC East when he gains experience, collected an interception.\n\nRookie defensive tackle Davon Godchaux was once again easy to spot because even though he plays in the interior of the line, he's the guy standing up guards and penetrating the backfield.\n\nByron Maxwell, meanwhile, caused two fumbles.\n\nThe most significant question that remains on the Miami defense is middle linebacker Mike Hull. He took some bad angles trying to rally to the football. He once filled a hole and the running back simply went elsewhere. So this is a bit of an issue.\n\nBut overall, the defense looked ... pretty good.\n\nYes, it was against Ryan Mallett. And yes, it is only the second preseason game.\n\nBut it says here that while the offense breaks in the new quarterback and finally puts a cohesive offensive line on the field, it's going to be up to the defense to hold the proverbial fort.", "id": "9862615", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Dolphins defense has to hold the fort while Jay Cutler, offense gel", "image":

Tackle Eric Smith performed very well against the Falcons last week, With the unknown status of Ju'Wuan James going forward, the team could use a backup tackle like Smith to fill in\n\nSixth-round pick Vincent Taylor is another player I will be keeping a close eye on against the Ravens. Davon Godchaux received all the praise during training camp and deservingly so.

Three offensive linemen expected to start or be key backups - John Urschel (retired), Alex Lewis (shoulder) and Nico Siragusa (knee) - aren't options anymore. Starting left tackle Ronnie Stanley and reserve right tackle Stephane Nembot are also currently sidelined. The good news is that right guard Marshal Yanda and right tackle Austin Howard could make their preseason debuts Thursday. The hope is that will stabilize what's quickly become the team's biggest concern.\n\nVETERAN: Rush linebacker Za'Darius Smith has had a solid camp as he attempts to solidify his role with the team. The Ravens are deep at outside linebacker after adding rookies Tyus Bowser and Tim Williams to a mix that already includes Smith, Terrell Suggs, Matthew Judon and Albert McClellan. The better Smith plays, the more interest he figures to garner from linebacker-needy teams. The Ravens, though, believe you can never have too many pass rushers.\n\nROOKIE: After sitting out the Ravens' preseason opener against the Washington Redskins because of a leg injury, first-round cornerback Marlon Humphrey will make his NFL debut against the Dolphins. Humphrey has been practicing extremely well and carries himself like a veteran. He likely won't start, but Ravens coach John Harbaugh will surely want to get an extended look at the former Alabama standout.\n\nON THE BUBBLE: Wide receiver/kick returner Keenan Reynolds' path to a 53-man roster spot is a little less treacherous than it was when training camp began. Injuries to Breshad Perriman, Kenny Bell and Tim White, coupled by uneven practice performances by Chris Matthews and Chris Moore, have opened the door for the former Navy quarterback.\n\nReynolds made his biggest play as a Raven with a 46-yard punt return last week. However, he was held without a catch and now has only one reception in five career preseason games. He's going to have to start making some plays on offense to garner a spot.\n\nINJURY REPORT: The Ravens are expected to be without quarterback Joe Flacco, wide receivers Perriman and Bell, offensive linemen Stanley and Nembot, linebacker Lamar Louis and cornerback Brandon Boykin. A number of veterans, who were held out from last week's game, are expected to make their preseason debuts.\n\njeff.zrebiec@baltsun.com\n\ntwitter.com/jeffzrebiecsun", "id": "9652936", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Five storylines for Ravens second preseason game against the Miami Dolphins", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-599440e9/turbine/bs-sp-ravens-preseason-20170815", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Hit record"}, "id": "302645", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_record"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}, "id": "304975", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "id": "305661", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "id": "305872", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback"}, {"label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "id": "309400", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker"}, {"label": {"eng": "Washington Redskins"}, "id": "310124", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Redskins"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}, "id": "310130", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lineman (American football)"}, "id": "319761", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(American_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Guard (American and Canadian football)"}, "id": "322621", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(American_and_Canadian_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Offensive line"}, "id": "324464", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_line"}, {"label": {"eng": "John Harbaugh"}, "id": "335401", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harbaugh"}, {"label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}, "id": "335402", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens"}, {"label": {"eng": "Outside linebacker"}, "id": "336932", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker#Types_of_linebackers"}, {"label": {"eng": "Joe Flacco"}, "id": "342533", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Flacco"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chris Matthews"}, "id": "352272", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Matthews"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Ravens"}, "id": "358852", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ravens"}, {"label": {"eng": "Return specialist"}, "id": "369721", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_specialist"}, {"label": {"eng": "John Urschel"}, "id": "398285", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Urschel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Marshal Yanda"}, "id": "401155", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshal_Yanda"}, {"label": {"eng": "Terrell Suggs"}, "id": "401156", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrell_Suggs"}, {"label": {"eng": "Austin Howard"}, "id": "520939", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Howard"}, {"label": {"eng": "Albert McClellan"}, "id": "543276", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_McClellan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}, "id": "1269622", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Breshad Perriman"}, "id": "1275288", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breshad_Perriman"}, {"label": {"eng": "Keenan Reynolds (American football)"}, "id": "1276294", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keenan_Reynolds_(American_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ronnie Stanley"}, "id": "1281007", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Stanley"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 30, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 374, "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans"}], "time": "09:31:00"}

So in that regard this is a routine thing.\n\nBut these decisions, for this game, are hardly routine for Gase because he's dealing with a unique set of circumstances that make these calls difficult.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins, you see, are reeling from injuries. They've already lost their starting quarterback for the season. They've already lost their starting middle linebacker for the season. Their starting left guard is headed to the injured reserve list because he tore the bicep in his right arm and won't be available until sometime in November. The starting and backup running backs are either in the NFL concussion protocol or have just emerged from it. A backup cornerback is out for the season with a torn Achilles' tendon. The starting center is being managed carefully because he's had multiple hip injuries the past couple of years and hasn't played a full season since 2011.\n\nAll the injuries make for one long, long paragraph.\n\nOh, and did I mention the turf at Hard Rock Stadium is awful?\n\nThat's right, players complained to their coaches during and after the preseason opener last week that the footing was treacherous and more likely to cause an injury than if it was in good condition.\n\nQuarterback Jay Cutler ... He is the new starter and will start tonight against Baltimore. That is decided. The question is how long does he go? And the answer to that question may depend on the relative health of the offensive line. The line is banged up. So a little care is required but ultimately, Cutler has to protect himself, too.\n\nMatt Moore? I would only play him a couple of series if at all. He doesn't need it. I'd play David Fales and Brandon Doughty a majority of the game.\n\nThe offensive line ... Starting left guard Ted Larsen is out with that biceps tear. So do the Dolphins play Anthony Steen there? Or Kraig Urbik? The only way Urbik plays there is if center Mike Pouncey starts at center. He wants to play. Gase is less inclined to play him. If Pouncey does not play, Urbik starts at center. By the way, Urbik has been nursing tightness in his back so his status might depend on how well he warms up.\n\nJa'Wuan James has been nursing a shoulder injury and hasn't practiced all week. Don't count on him playing tonight. Obviously, the team has to find a :LG so Anthony Steen might work in there if Urbik starts at center. If Pouncey starts at center tonight, Urbik can move to LG.\n\nBy the way, if Pouncey plays tonight one has to wonder why? Why? Why, why, why?\n\nWhat do the Dolphins want to prove? What happened to bubble wrap?\n\nMy guess, my hope is Pouncey does not play until maybe next week.\n\nLaremy Tunsil and Jermon Bushrod are expected to play. Tunsil missed last week's game so he needs the snaps.\n\nRunning back ... The question is do the Dolphins put Jay Ajayi out there? He emerged from the concussion protocol on Monday. The day before, he had to leave practice because he was dehydrated. So it makes sense to keep him sidelined and get him fully immersed next week in dual practices with the Philadelphia Eagles before playing him some against the Eagles.\n\nThe Dolphins, however, might see value in playing Ajayi so he can get some preseason-speed repetitions with new quarterback Jay Cutler.\n\nThe Two-Jays are going to be a thing this season if the Dolphins are going to succeed, so coaches may decide it's necessary to get them on the same page with handoffs and pass protection and Ajayi running pass routes.\n\nThis is solid football thinking. Except, again, Ajayi is coming off a concussion. His backup Kenyan Drake is in the concussion protocol. You're going to hand him the ball 1,537,038 times this season. This game is meaningless. There are good dual practices next week to help the Two-Jays get chemistry -- and then a game, and then two more weeks of practice after that before the regular-season opener.\n\nThe risk versus reward of playing Ajayi tonight doesn't seem to weigh evenly.\n\nSo which way does Gase lean? Decisions like this is why he gets the big bucks.\n\nMe? I get the tiny bucks. I don't have a say. But I would hold Ajayi out.\n\nReceivers .. Everyone's healthy. Everyone should play as long as Cutler plays. This group, including the starting tight ends and wide outs, need to catch up to Cutler and vice versa. They need work together. They need to play.\n\nDefensive line ... No major injuries here. Everyone should play. I wouldn't exactly burden Ndamukong Suh, Cameron Wake, Andre Branch and William Hayes with many snaps. They really do not need it. But I'd play Davon Godchaux and Jordan Phillips a long time, if not the entire game -- one, because he needs the experience to be better as the starter in the regular season; the other, because he needs to mount a rally to get his starting job back or prove he can't do it.\n\nI'd play first-round pick Charles Harris a lot. He needs the experience. He needs to get rid of the butterflies he suffered in the preseason opener. He needs to get used to this stage because the stage gets much bigger Sept. 10.\n\nLinebackers ... Everybody plays. I'd be careful with Kiko Alonso and Lawrence Timmons. They don't need a half of football. I'd let starting middle linebacker Mike Hull play plenty. He needs to show if he's capable of being the guy in the middle or not. Obviously, all the backups have to play a lot, including on special teams.\n\nDefensive backs ... Everybody plays. We don't need to see a ton from Reshad Jones and Byron Maxwell. But Xavien Howard needs work. Bobby McCain needs work. T.J. McDonald needs work.\n\nNate Allen has been nursing a groin injury, hasn't practiced in over a week and isn't going to play unless somebody loses their mind.\n\nIf you're arguing that Jones needs to play more to get chemistry on the back end with McDonald, I remind you McDonald is suspended the first eight games of the season. So chemistry between him and Jones isn't a thing. McDonald does, however, need to play a lot because he's going to get two months off pretty soon.\n\nAll the backups in the defensive backfield should play.\n\nThe goal tonight is not to win this game. The Dolphins will play the Ravens in the regular-season on Oct. 26. The goal is to win that game. One way to help do that is by staying healthy tonight.", "id": "9806706", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Miami Dolphins face intriguing play-or-sit decisions versus Baltimore Ravens", "image": "http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/armando-salguero/xa2259/picture167775697/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Mike%20Pouncey", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 5460, "date": "2017-09-10", "amb": false, "textEnd": 5468}, {"textStart": 6592, "date": "-10-26", "amb": false, "textEnd": 6599}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}, "id": "304975", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "id": "305661", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "id": "305872", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback"}, {"label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "id": "309400", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tight end"}, "id": "312020", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end"}, {"label": {"eng": "Concussion"}, "id": "312167", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Football League preseason"}, "id": "314202", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_preseason"}, {"label": {"eng": "Guard (American and Canadian football)"}, "id": "322621", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(American_and_Canadian_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "id": "324224", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back"}, {"label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}, "id": "327126", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles"}, {"label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}, "id": "331328", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins"}, {"label": {"eng": "Laremy Tunsil"}, "id": "333882", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laremy_Tunsil"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adam Gase"}, "id": "341272", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Gase"}, {"label": {"eng": "David Fales"}, "id": "346034", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fales"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jay Cutler (American football)"}, "id": "355416", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Cutler_(American_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ndamukong Suh"}, "id": "369603", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ndamukong_Suh"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lawrence Timmons"}, "id": "379072", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Timmons"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kiko Alonso"}, "id": "379476", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiko_Alonso"}, {"label": {"eng": "Byron Maxwell"}, "id": "397241", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Maxwell"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cameron Wake"}, "id": "420396", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Wake"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mike Pouncey"}, "id": "420397", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pouncey"}, {"label": {"eng": "Anthony Steen"}, "id": "891473", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Steen"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 566, "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Online"}], "time": "17:32:00"}

Coach Adam Gase has the respect of many around the league. The work he was able to do with a previous regime's team was highly impressive. The injuries to quarterback Ryan Tannehill, linebacker Raekwon McMillan, and now cornerback Tony Lippett are already threatening the expectations of a playoff season in South Beach.\n\nFormer Chicago Bear QB Jay Cutler can potentially bridge the gap as the team's signal-caller, but much of his performance is totally unknown, which makes the Dolphins a fascinating wild card in the AFC. If the team is to meet its initial expectations, Cutler will have a large part to play, but the 10 most talented players on this team can go a long way toward mitigating the loss of a high draft pick on defense and a QB the team deems worthy of the \"franchise\" title.\n\nDT Ndamukong Suh\n\nSuh is widely regarded as one of the most physically dominant interior defensive linemen in football. He's violent, powerful, explosive and versatile, able to single-handedly wreck a team's offensive game plan on any given Sunday. Suh has played better than his numbers might suggest. He has been worth the dollars the Dolphins are paying him for his services. However, a season with more finished plays could stiffen up a defense that was desperately hoping McMillan would improve against the inside run.\n\nS Reshad Jones\n\nJones was sorely missed by this defense last year and is largely forgotten in the discussion of the best safeties in football. His play is 2015, when he played all 16 games, was an impressive campaign: He logged over 100 tackles with five interceptions and 10 passes defensed.\n\nFor perspective, those three thresholds (100+ tackles, 5+ interceptions and 10+ passes defensed) have been reached in the same season only five times in NFL history by four players: Baltimore Ravens LB Ray Lewis (2003), San Diego Chargers LB Donnie Edwards (2002, 2004), Jones, and New York Giants safety Landon Collins (2016).\n\nDE Cameron Wake\n\nWake is facing the daunting task of continuing to succeed as an aging speed rusher in the NFL, but his triumphant return from an Achilles tear in 2015 should suggest it would be wise to never bet against the former CFL star. Wake's prowess as a speed rusher off the edge gives Miami opponents a difficult problem to solve, especially with Suh lining up on the interior.\n\nWR Jarvis Landry\n\nLandry is the heart and soul of Miami's offensive unit. While he isn't the most physically gifted athlete, he wins with high football intelligence, technical prowess, and a toughness that's difficult to match. Landry enters this season with his long-term future up in the air, but he has said he understands it is part of the business. When he is signed (by Miami or another team) to a deal that averages over $10 million APY, the value will be worth it. Landry epitomizes what it means to be a football player.\n\nOT Laremy Tunsil\n\nExpect Tunsil to shine this year at his natural position, left tackle. After playing inside at guard as a rookie, it will be a welcome sight to see him pushing pass rushers past the quarterback on the back side. Tunsil was well worth the hype as a potential top-10 selection in the 2016 NFL Draft before a questionable video several years prior caused him to slide on draft night. The Dolphins will be glad they took the chance on him; his technique and functional athleticism are top-notch.\n\n(Photo by Matthew Visinsky/Icon Sportswire)\n\nRB Jay Ajayi\n\nAjayi exploded onto the scene after a quiet rookie season by hanging 200-plus rushing yards on the Buffalo Bills and Pittsburgh Steelers. Ajayi finished in the top three in rushing leaders on the year, but his potential is still largely untapped. The Dolphins' running game was hampered by bad interior blocking, something that forced Ajayi to work hard just to get back to the line of scrimmage.\n\nAdditionally, Ajayi was a quality pass catcher in college. The team hopes to get more out of him as a receiver this year. Provided the offensive line has greater stability, 2017 should be a year for Ajayi to showcase his full arsenal of abilities.\n\nLB Kiko Alonso\n\nThe Dolphins have to be thrilled with their return for trading the eighth pick in the 2016 draft to the Philadelphia Eagles. Miami moved down a handful of slots, landed the previously mentioned Tunsil, and also hauled in its best LB in the same deal. Alonso was rewarded for a strong effort last year with a contract extension. He's the one true second-level weapon for the Dolphins. Few linebackers have the range and movement skills of a healthy Alonso. He's entering this season projecting to play in a more favorable role for his skill set.\n\nWR Kenny Stills\n\nBased off athletic ability alone, WR Devante Parker could have an edge on Stills, but Stills was this team's big-play target in the passing game. The team was a dropped Stills catch against Seattle from having a road win to open the season last year, although Stills more than made up for the mistake with nine touchdowns in total.\n\nThe addition of Jay Cutler has the potential to improve Stills' productivity; Cutler tries to work the ball to the sidelines with much greater frequency than Tannehill, whose chemistry with Jarvis Landry shone brightest over the middle.\n\nC Mike Pouncey\n\nWill Pouncey's troublesome hip cooperate? The team certainly hopes so. Instability at center and guard has plagued this franchise for the better part of the past two years. The guard position has been an issue for Miami since Richie Incognito was booted off the team for bullying Jonathan Martin. Stability is essential.\n\nPouncey, when healthy, is a top-tier center in the league. His presence would shore up pass protection and run blocking, which gives Miami every chance to succeed in 2017. He's the second X-factor on this team behind Jay Cutler.\n\nCB Byron Maxwell\n\nMaxwell was the second starter the Dolphins landed in their trade with the Philadelphia Eagles prior to last season. Maxwell played very well down the stretch for Miami, stabilizing one of two cornerback positions. Maxwell won't endear fans of physical defense; he's not a hitter and his tackling skills leave something to be desired. As a pass defender, though, his play in the second half of last year was some of the best Miami has seen at cornerback since Vontae Davis.\n\nMaxwell's long-term concern: His contract is a high hit and the team has recent investments -- Xavien Howard, Cordrea Tankersley, and the injured Tony Lippett -- who could make him expendable.\n\nHonorable mention: QB Ryan Tannehill\n\nYou have to feel for Tannehill, who experienced sustained success in 2016 before partially tearing his left ACL against the Arizona Cardinals. After passing on surgery to stay available for a playoff run, Tannehill rehabbed the knee all spring, only to re-injure the joint in practice and end up on Injured Reserve. No, Tannehill isn't a top-tier passer, but he's a quality starter.\n\nRelated Items:AFC East, Miami Dolphins, NFL Today FanRag Sports Daily NFL Newsletter", "id": "9806724", "details": {}, "date":

He has yet to practice in training camp because of a back injury.\n\n\"We have a time frame with that,\" Harbaugh said Thursday night. \"I don't think that time frame is this week yet. So we will stick with the plan on that. I think it's a straightforward date that the doctors and the back specialists have given us. So we're going to stick with that.\"\n\nUnder that timetable, the earliest Flacco would practice is Aug. 27, which would give him two weeks to get ready for the regular-season opener in Cincinnati, set for Sept. 10. The Ravens, though, haven't announced definitively when Flacco will come back.\n\nAt the start of training camp, doctors told Flacco and the Ravens that he would need about a week of rest for his back issue to subside. The 32-year-old now will miss at least four weeks of practice.\n\nAccording to the team last week, Flacco was re-examined and his progress from a back issue \"is good.\" The Ravens ruled out Flacco from the rest of the preseason at that point.\n\nFlacco has been one of the most durable quarterbacks in the NFL.

But here are five others to key on in the Miami Dolphins' second preseason game tonight against Baltimore at Hard Rock Stadium:\n\n1. Mike Hull. Look, Hull is a valuable part of the team. Hull and Michael Thomas had 18 special-teams tackles for the Dolphins last year, tied for second in the league behind New England's Nate Ebner (19), according to Football Outsiders. No one else had more than 15. The question is whether Hull is a valuable Larry Izzo-type, a special-teamer par excellence, or a starting middle linebacker. There are doubts about this inside the organization. Tonight will provide another look toward a conclusion. The working idea is they're going to find a veteran run-stopping middle linebacker to replace the injured Raekwon McMillan. They brought in a couple for a workout this week (Rey Maualuga, Kelvin Sheppard). If neither is signed, the cut-down date on Sept. 2 will bring another look. The other option is to move Lawrence Timmons or Kiko Alonso inside and play Neville Hewitt in the base. Tonight is Hull's chance to answer some questions about him as a middle linebacker in the base defense.\n\n2. The offensive line. Yes, the whole bunch. First of all, who protects Jay Cutler? Center Mike Pouncey almost certainly won't. Right tackle Ja'Wuan has been nursing a shoulder issue. Center/guard Kraig Urbik has a back problem. How to balance getting in work and helping Cutler with this being a preseason game? Beyond that, the fill-ins look like they'll be counted on this year. Anthony Steen. Jake Brendel. Issac Asiata. Sam Young. Eric Smith. You can go down the list. They'll all be watched tonight.\n\n3. Davon Godchaux. He's been the top surprise in training camp. He had a solid preseason game. Now comes the biggest test any defensive tackle can have: Marshal Yanda. The Ravens right guard is the best in the business and is expected to play tonight. Can the fifth-round rookie defensive tackle hold his own against Yanda? Can Jordan Phillips start to change the underachiever label around him?\n\n4. Alterraun Verner. The cornerback position's depth took a significant hit this week with the loss of Tony Lippett (Achilles). Lippett was a reserve, but played 75 percent of the time last year and started due to Xavien Howard's injuries a lot of that time. Who fills in? You can't have enough cornerbacks. Verner looks like he'll get the first shot at replacing McCain and has impressed so far in what he can do. With Joe Flacco not playing for Baltimore, the Dolphins cornerbacks won't be going against top-flight talent. Ryan Mallett is expected to start.\n\n5. Damore'ea Stringfellow. Throw in Storm Johnson and any other fringe newcomer who's turned your head this summer. They've got to keep it going so that a few weeks down the line it becomes a tougher decision for the Dolphins decision-makers. Can Stringfellow make another big play with the lights on? Can Johnson take advantage of some injuries at running back?\n\ndhyde@sun-sentinel.com; On Twitter @davehydesports;\n\nTo read Dave Hyde's blog click here.

Along the way, Cutler was kept upright save for a wallop that saw him land on his throwing shoulder.\n\nEarly concerns on the Cutler front were two-fold: (1) Would he hit the field in football shape after a trifling foray into broadcasting and (2) show any semblance of chemistry with his newfound gaggle of pass-catchers? No major concerns emerged on either front, with Cutler fitting in as well as anything we've seen from the sidelined Ryan Tannehill. Evidence of this came on Cutler's second drive, which failed to deliver points but showcased the quarterback running a no-huddle version of the offense on his first night on the job.\n\nTeams typically reveal sub-zero data during these on-field August rituals, but this appears to be the same Cutler from autumns past. With that comes a rash of positives -- command of the playbook and unusual arm strength -- and a Cutler-esque ceiling bound to haunt the Dolphins in critical moments.\n\nLove him or hate him, this is the Cutler we've known all along -- and, for now, Miami's most important puzzle piece in 2017.\n\nHere's what else we learned during Thursday's preseason action:\n\n1. Starting opposite Cutler, Ryan Mallett (13 of 22 for 113 yards) continued to operate as a mixed bag for the Ravens. Filling in for the back-addled Joe Flacco, Baltimore's backup passer generated 35 yards over his first three drives, with the final of those marches ending with a hazardous deep ball to Quincy Adeboyejo that wound up in the hands of Dolphins cornerback Xavien Howard. Mallett bounced back against Miami's backups, putting the team in position for a pair of Justin Tucker field goals before tossing a 1-yard scoring strike to Larry Donnell following a Dolphins blocked punt. It wasn't a complete car crash, with Mallett hitting targets for gains of 8, 9, 11, 11 and 19 yards. Still, he was guilty of missing receivers, throwing short of the sticks, unfurling tipped balls and failing to squelch an aura of discomfort over one of the NFL's most concerning backup quarterback scenarios.\n\n2. The Ravens clearly view Terrance West as their lead back. The fourth-year runner handled six of Baltimore's first eight carries, generating a troubling minus-2 yards off the workload. Buck Allen hit the scene in the second quarter and ran hard for 40 yards off 10 totes, while adding another 16 yards through the air. The loss of Kenneth Dixon will sting this team all season.\n\n3. Tyrod Taylor's evening ended under a cloud. Buffalo's starting quarterback led six drives, generating three punts, a field goal and a pair of ugly picks. The first came off a deflection at his own 10-yard line, but the second was enough to cause Bills fans to toss furniture through living-room windows (if the preseason can elicit such a reaction), with Taylor lobbing an underthrown pass downfield for Anquan Boldin, only to have the ball snatched away by Ronald Darby, the ex-Buffalo cover man traded to the Eagles a week ago. Amid whispers of a down camp for Taylor, Buffalo's starter put up a grisly line that saw him peg 8 of 18 throws at just 2.9 yards per attempt -- good enough for a ghastly passer rating of 12.0.\n\n4. After decisively (and mercifully) parting ways with naif-booter Roberto Aguayo, the Bucs have found rock-solid stability in the kicking game -- right? Wrong. After Tampa drew first blood against Jacksonville with Doug Martin's 2-yard scoring burst, veteran Nick Folk pranced onto the field to cap off the march, only to have the extra point swatted down by tall-as-an-oak Jaguars lineman Calais Campbell. The kicker went on to hit a pair of field goals before botching a 47-yarder, forcing coach Dirk Koetter to shake his head over the dark-arts chaos attached to Tampa's special teams. Folk is a proven leg, but this still feels like one of the most hexed positional groups league-wide.\n\n5. Speaking of Martin, the Bucs back looked sensational for the second straight game, pounding his way for 30 yards off six carries over Tampa's first two drives. The 28-year-old runner galloped with saucy explosion and speed, leading the way for a Bucs attack that outgained the Jaguars 240 yards to 59 over the first two quarters.\n\n6. It was encouraging to see Jameis Winston (21 of 29 for 196 yards) calmly guide Tampa downfield on back-to-back scoring drives to start the night. Still, the promising field-general made an awful decision on his third series, launching the ball into space while being tugged to the turf at the Jacksonville 11. Winston's duck of a pass looped into the end zone, where it was picked off by Barry Church. Officials nullified the turnover, ruling that Winston's progress was stopped, but it's just the type of decision Koetter will fry his quarterback for on next week's Hard Knocks. Winston nearly threw another pick on the following drive and fumbled a pass attempt before the half that was picked up by teammate Adam Humphries. The box score looks hot, but Thursday was a reminder that one of the league's most promising young quarterbacks still has work to do after generating 41 turnovers over his first two NFL seasons.\n\n7. Is Blake Bortles running out of rope in Jacksonville? Another frustrating outing saw the devolving fourth-year quarterback utterly misfire on a deep ball to wideout Allen Robinson, who got open between a pair of cover men 30 yards downfield. It's worth noting that a steamed Doug Marrone forced his Jaguars starters to play into the second half with Chad Henne -- not Bortles -- at the helm. Henne doesn't exactly get the blood humming, but how long until management decides it's time for Bortles to be hidden away like the Ark of the Covenant?\n\n9. In Philadelphia, Carson Wentz was sluggish out of the gate, sailing a pair of passes over the head of Alshon Jeffery, with the second of those coming in the end zone on third-and-goal. Wentz looked his best guiding the Eagles on a 65-yard, first-quarter march that went swimmingly until LeGarrette Blount fumbled the ball away at Buffalo's 27. For the second straight week, Philly's overmatched line struggled to open holes on the ground.\n\n10. On the opposite side of the ball, Eagles lineman Brandon Graham flashed moments of dominance, surging into Buffalo's backfield to bury LeSean McCoy for a 3-yard loss. Piling up six sacks, 13 hits on the quarterback and eight tackles for negative yardage, Jim Schwartz's front seven caused issues all night for the work-in-progress Bills.", "id": "9823270", "details":

People can't help but see the size, athleticism and speed that made him so appealing to the Dolphins as the No. 14 overall pick two years ago, but the conversation tends to stall on words like \"potential\" and \"if.\"\n\nHis new quarterback, Jay Cutler, is ready to buy.\n\n\"Really good player,\" Cutler said. \"The sky's the limit for him. He can do a lot of different things.\"\n\nWhen pressed about whether Parker reminds him of any receiver he's had before, Cutler chose former Pro Bowl pick Alshon Jeffery.\n\n\"I think he's kind of a faster Alshon,\" he said. \"He's got a lot of range -- back shoulder, over the top. He's got great hands. And he can burn you up if you get a little flat-footed.\"\n\nSouth Florida's heard this before.\n\nRemember how last year was supposed to be Parker's breakthrough? The Dolphins were still trying to establish good lifestyle habits with him well into last season, he was inconsistent and ended up with a solid but unspectacular season.\n\nAt the risk of falling for this again, the evidence is stacking up in Parker's favor right now. It seems like it's time to believe.\n\nThere's no more talk around the team about changes he needs to make; rather, people are pointing out changes he has made. He's been an exasperating coverage assignment for cornerbacks. And most importantly, there's been no mention of any injury, even a minor tweak.\n\nParker worked a short shift in tonight's preseason game, a 31-7 loss to Baltimore, but continued exactly what he's shown all summer. His best play was nixed by a holding call in the backfield, but the skill he displayed on a 31-yard pass from Cutler on Miami's opening series is an indication of how good he is.\n\n\"That's just him,\" said Cutler, who hit Parker on a 16-yarder over the middle to start the next possession. \"He naturally knows where the ball's going to go. He can feel the defender, whether he's on his top shoulder or he's got him beat. I just kinda throw it. Some of these guys have a better feel than others, and he's one of those guys that knows where the ball is going to go.\"\n\nThat \"I just kinda throw it\" line must sound awfully enticing to Parker. He's going to enjoy playing with Cutler, who's never shown an aversion to launching it deep. That might not always be the most profitable play, such as the ball he chucked into double coverage for Parker on a near-interception, but the opportunities are sure to be there.\n\n\"The chemistry's been going pretty good and it'll probably get even better as we get running along and catching passes,\" Parker said.\n\nParker missed much of last year's preseason with a hamstring injury that ultimately kept him out of the opener at Seattle. He made it through all 15 games after that and finished second on the team in catches (56), yards (744) and touchdown receptions (four), but it was a choppy ride to get there and those aren't convincing statistics for someone who's supposed to be a No. 1 receiver.\n\nLast season, he had two 100-yard games and eight games under 50 yards. That inconsistency generally intertwined with the ups and downs of his health. The hamstring issue never seemed to fully go away, and he had back problems late in the year.\n\nThe absence of those concerns is what makes this preseason so promising for Parker. He's back to having fun at work every day, which is much easier now that his body feels right.\n\n\"It's been real good,\" he said. \"I'm healthy and I just like coming out and competing every day and getting better.\"\n\n[Jay Ajayi shakes off \"fog\" of concussion, ready to play]", "id": "9862626", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Time to believe in Dolphins WR DeVante Parker?

Baltimore is always one of the best teams in the NFL on special teams and they have football's best kicker in Justin Tucker. They also should have one of the league's best defenses.\n\nIt is very clear what the Ravens formula will be this year if they are to have a successful season. They are going to have to grind out low-scoring games. Nothing will come easy for this team and it is hard to imagine it blowing out any opponent this year. Nearly every game could be a nail biter, but the reality that has been Baltimore's formula for some time now.\n\nInstead of addressing the ailing offense in the draft, Ozzie Newsome used his first four draft picks on Marlon Humphrey, Tyus Bowser, Chris Wormley and Tim Williams, all defensive players. In free agency, Baltimore re-signed Brandon Williams and acquired Tony Jefferson, both inking big-money deals as they watched their starting right tackle, Ricky Wagner, depart for Detroit.\n\nThe addition of Jefferson is an interesting one. Let's focus on what he brings to Baltimore as well as where this secondary as a whole stands right now. It is quite possibly a much better unit than you realize.\n\nAdding Jefferson does a lot for this defense overall. First of all, it puts Eric Weddle at free safety, which is the best role for him at this point of his career. Of course Weddle will continue to line up all over the defense and should remain an excellent player at 32 years old. He is coming off a simply outstanding season in his first year with the Ravens. But keeping him as the last layer of defense is how Weddle can help the Ravens most. This allows him to align and communicate with the rest of Baltimore's young secondary and see the entire field. Quarterbacks should be wary of challenging Weddle in the deep portions of the field.\n\nJefferson is very versatile, and he brings a lot of value close to the line of scrimmage. He is a very good blitzer and superb run defender. Making his addition even more prudent is that Baltimore is looking for a second level linebacker to play next to CJ Mosley. In some packages, Jefferson should fulfill this very well in today's NFL, where every defense wants as much speed on the field as possible. Jefferson has really improved as a coverage player from early in his career as well.\n\nS Tony Jefferson (22) reacts after he makes a big tackle. (Icon Sportswire)\n\nWeddle and Jefferson are now one of the NFL's premier safety tandems, but Baltimore also has Lardarius Webb. Webb played just shy of 1,000 snaps for the Ravens last year and had a very good season. A converted cornerback, you would think that Webb is a finesse cover safety. While he does show very good coverage skills, he is also effective against the run as well. He gives the Ravens a lot of possibilities with their coverages and should see plenty of time alongside Weddle and Jefferson in the lineup.\n\nAt cornerback, Tavon Young's season-ending injury is a bad break for this defense. Last year's fourth round pick was a very pleasant surprise for Baltimore in his rookie season. Young played more snaps than any other Ravens cornerback in 2016 and very well could have had the best season of that crew. Brandon Boykin was added and could possibly help fill Young's void.\n\nWhile it would be great to have Young, Baltimore did sign Brandon Carr away from Dallas and drafted Humphrey in the first round. Carr had a decent season last year, as the Cowboys went back to playing more man coverage. He isn't a real interested run defender, but Carr logged a lot of snaps for the Cowboys and is still a quality second cornerback at 31 years old.\n\nIt remains to be seen as to how much Humphrey will be used in his rookie season. His talent is undeniable. He is big with rare strength and physicality for the position. This guy was born to be a Raven and will bring attitude to the position against the run and pass. While there is obvious talent with Baltimore's first round pick, he also could be primed to taking a lot of penalties at this level and also struggles to play the ball deep downfield. Humphrey has also been out for some time with an undisclosed injury, which obviously doesn't help his development.\n\nThe last prominent member of this secondary to discuss is possibly the most talented one, Jimmy Smith. Smith's career has been too up and down thus far and injuries have been at play too often. Smith has played in all 16 games just twice in his six NFL seasons. But this is a guy with lockdown ability. He has size and strength and moves like the big first round cornerback that he was in 2011.\n\nIf Smith and Humphrey can put it all together for a full season, Baltimore's secondary could be right up there with Denver's as the best in football. Even if these two remains uneven, this is still an excellent unit.\n\nRelated Items:AFC North, Baltimore Ravens, NFL Today FanRag Sports Daily NFL Newsletter", "id": "9828799", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Ravens secondary can be even better than expected", "image": "https://d3d2maoophos6y.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/24161613/DHX161225186_Ravens_at_Steelers.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "189313", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "198006", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "210760", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "id": "302552", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}, "id": "304975", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "id": "305661", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "id": "305872", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback"}, {"label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "id": "309400", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker"}, {"label": {"eng": "Safety (American and Canadian football position)"}, "id": "309405", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Free agent"}, "id": "310476", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent"}, {"label": {"eng": "Placekicker"}, "id": "311350", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placekicker"}, {"label": {"eng": "Line of scrimmage"}, "id": "312091", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_scrimmage"}, {"label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}, "id": "335402", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens"}, {"label": {"eng": "Blitz (gridiron football)"}, "id": "340145", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitz_(gridiron_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Justin Tucker"}, "id": "341502", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Tucker"}, {"label": {"eng": "Brandon Boykin"}, "id": "342458", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Boykin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Eric Weddle"}, "id": "374405", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Weddle"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lardarius Webb"}, "id": "374406", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lardarius_Webb"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ozzie Newsome"}, "id": "406289", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozzie_Newsome"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tony Jefferson"}, "id": "474697", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Jefferson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Brandon Carr"}, "id": "514481", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Carr"}, {"label": {"eng": "C.

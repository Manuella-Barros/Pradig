The duo went after each other hard, and some heavy punches were laid by each player.\n\nTkachuk ended up winning the fight. He threw Pastrnak to the ice and got a couple of massive shots on Boston's top scorer.\n\nNonetheless, Pastrnak won the respect of coach Jim Montgomery, who appreciated his star's efforts to spark the otherwise listless Bruins.\n\n\"I'm really proud of Pasta,\" Montgomery told reporters after the game. \"There's so many guys out there pushing after the whistle and the linesmen are there. Pasta and Tkachuk just went out there and fought. That's what you like. You like your hockey players to be competitors.\"\n\nHere's what to know about the Pastrnak vs. Tkachuk fight and the unique way it unfolded.\n\nMORE: Tracking the NHL's latest coaching moves as Leafs fire Sheldon Keefe\n\nPastrnak and Tkachuk's fight didn't appear to be about any one issue. They simply squared off because the Bruins needed a spark after growing frustrated with their efforts in a 6-1 defeat.\n\nTkachuk was a thorn in Boston's side all evening, logging four hits and playing his usual brand of physical hockey. He jawed with Pastrnak, and others, at times throughout the contest, so that made him a logical target of the Bruins star when he decided to drop the gloves.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Tkachuk was ready and willing to brawl with Pastrnak after the two got into a shouting match near the center dot. Boston's top scorer was as well, but he waited until he got Montgomery's permission to engage in a scrap.\n\nMontgomery evidently gave him the go-ahead -- the 54-year-old denied that he did after the game, but that may have been just a procedural declaration -- and the fisticuffs occurred shortly thereafter.\n\nMontgomery expressed pride in Pastrnak's decision to fight while also calling Tkachuk out for getting in what he thought were some extra shots on his top winger after he fell to the ice.\n\nPastrnak didn't seem to mind too much. He lost the fight and received a game misconduct for his actions, but he showed no fear in taking on the bigger, stronger Tkachuck, who is 6-2, 210 pounds compared to Pastrnak's 6-0, 196-pound frame.\n\n\"I'm not afraid of him, to be honest,\" Pastrnak said of Tkachuk. \"I can take a punch and I'd do anything for these guys here.\"\n\nPastrnak's teammates will be happy with his efforts as a fighter, but all parties involved with the Bruins will hope he can have more of an impact on scoring as the series returns to Boston. He has scored three times during the 2024 NHL playoffs but has just one goal -- the Game 7, game-winner vs. Toronto -- over his last five games.\n\nNo, neither will be suspended because of their fight. Each was sent off for the end of Game 2, but they won't face any extra discipline from the NHL.\n\nPastrnak and Tkachuk were just two of 12 players sent off in the third period because of misconduct calls. It was a chippy playoff game and the officials were simply trying to keep players in check late in the Panthers' blowout win.\n\nBoth star players served their sentences to end Game 2. Now, each will focus on powering his team to a series win in Game 3 as the series heads to Boston.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriy_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andriy Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Official (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Keefe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheldon Keefe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ejection (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-05/David%20Pastrnak%2C%20Matt%20Tkachuk%20050924.png?itok=LRCh_X7E", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543724", "eventUri": "eng-9543724", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

Pastrnak had only one prior fight on his resume while Tkachuk boasts an extended list of bouts, according to Hockey Fights.\n\n\"You're in the games, it's a lot of emotions,\" Pastrnak told reporters after the Game 2 loss, via NHL's Amalie Benjamin. \"I'm not afraid of [Tkachuk], to be honest.\n\n\"I can take a punch and I'd do anything for these guys here.\"\n\nThe fight between Pastrnak and Tkachuk didn't come out of the blue; far from it.\n\nAs shown and discussed during the broadcast of the game, via Sportsnet, both players discussed their plans beforehand, let the officials know what was about to happen, and in the case of Pastrnak, he even got approval from his head coach, Jim Montgomery, on the bench.\n\n\"I thought our team was emotionally engaged,\" Montgomery told reporters in his postgame press conference on May 8. \"A little undisciplined, but that's part of playoff hockey.\n\n\"I'm really proud of [Pastrnak]. He just went out there and fought. You like your hockey players to be competitors.\"\n\nOne thing Montgomery didn't like, however, was Tkachuk's blows on Pastrnak once the fight was (seemingly) over. \"That's not part of the game to me,\" Montgomery said.\n\n\"It gets a little spicy out there and they wanted to go,\" Panthers head coach Paul Maurice told reporters after the game. \"I thought it was awesome.\n\n\"When it was over, they both looked like they were fine. Sorry if anyone's offended by that concept. I don't care. I thought it was awesome.\"\n\nIf only had that Pastrnak vs. Tkachuk fight happened on Wednesday...\n\nIn the third period of Game 2 alone, the officials handed out 146 penalty minutes. Throughout the game, both teams combined for a staggering 158 penalty minutes.\n\nThe Bruins finished Game 2 with 87 penalty minutes, the most for the franchise in a single postseason game since 1988. The Panthers racked up 71 themselves, the second-most in franchise history.\n\nThe Bruins' tally includes a 10-minute misconduct earned by Boston's Pat Maroon. It removed him from the game entirely as there was no material time left on the clock for him to complete the penalty and return.\n\nA brawl erupted with a little under nine minutes left in the game before Florida scored its sixth and final goal of the eventual 6-1 victory on Wednesday.\n\nA final scrum involving many players from both sides and leading to the fight between Pastrnak and Tkachuk took place after Florida's final goal, with around eight minutes left to play.\n\nAlthough the Bruins took an early lead just 12 minutes into Game 2 when Charlie Coyle put the puck inside of the Panthers' net to give Boston a 1-0 advantage, things only went south for the Bruins from that point on.\n\nAfter the first period, Florida dominated Boston from top to bottom. The Panthers scored six unanswered goals and peppered two Bruins' goaltenders with shots.\n\nAleksander Barkov scored a brace and got 2 assists, Sam Reinhart bagged 4 assists, Brandon Montour went for a goal and 2 dimes, and the trio of Steven Lorentz, Gustav Forsling and Eetu Luostarinen also added 1 goal each to Florida's tally on Wednesday.\n\nAfter allowing four goals, Bruins' Montgomery pulled starting goalie Jeremy Swayman and introduced backup Linus Ullmark, who allowed two more goals to the Panthers.

The series is tied 1-1.\n\n\"Man, you are going to see that on the highlights, over and over and over again,\" Panthers coach Paul Maurice told reporters. \"I think it's a good thing. You've got two elite offensive players. Tkachuk is a 100-point guy all day long. Pastrnak is this brilliant player.\n\n\"But it's playoffs. They each have their team and brothers in the room. It gets a little spicy out there. They wanted to go. I think it was awesome.\"\n\nPanthers defenseman Brandon Montour scored the final goal of the night with 8:02 remaining, triggering an initial scuffle. Panthers and Bruins players hit the boards and the ice as they exchanged blows, leading to four 10-minute misconduct penalties, essentially ejections at that point of the game.\n\nPlay resumed shortly after the brief stoppage, but was again halted when Tkachuk and Pastrnak dropped their gloves. Tkachuk and Pastrnak exchanged punches in front of their benches before Tkachuk forced his foe to the ground.\n\nThe Panthers forward then landed a punch, knocking off Pastrnak's helmet. He then hit the Bruins forward several more times in the back of the head before referees intervened.\n\nPastrnak, 27, attempted to get back to Tkachuk, 26, before the players were separated. They each were penalized and not allowed to return to the game.\n\nTkachuk received 80% of the vote for winning the fight, according to HockeyFights.com. According to that website, he also went 2-0 in fights during the regular season. He was 0-3 last season.\n\nPastrnak, who doesn't often fight during games, has only one other recorded fight on the website. Voters ruled that the 2018 scuffle with former Tampa Bay Lighting defenseman Daniel Girardi was a tie.\n\n\"I don't really want to get into it,\" Pastrnak, who had a scrape on his nose, said when asked about Tkachuk's late punches. \"I don't know. I'm not a very experienced fighter. I fell down. It's on me.\n\n\"I should have approached it a little bit better. I haven't been in many of those.\"\n\nIn total, 148 penalty minutes were dispersed in Game 2. The game featured 146 hits. Panthers forward Aleksander Barkov totaled two goals and two assists. Forward Sam Reinhart chipped in four assists. Montour logged a goal and two assists.\n\nDefenseman Gustav Forsling and forwards Steven Lorentz and Eetu Luostarinen also scored for the Panthers.\n\nForward Charlie Coyle scored the Bruins' lone goal.\n\nGame 3 of the best-of-seven game series will be at 7 p.m. EDT Friday in Boston. Game 4 will be Sunday in Boston. Game 5 is set for Tuesday in Sunrise.\n\n\"I don't think there will be any spillover to next game,\" Bruins coach Jim Montgomery said when asked about the Game 2 fights. \"These are two teams that are rivals. We played each other last year and playing each this year. It's going to be a series.\n\n\"I'm proud of Pastrnak. There are so many guys out there pushing after the whistle while the linesmen are there. Pastrnak and Tkachuk, they just went out there and fought. That's what you like. You like your hockey players to be competitors.\"", "source": {"uri": "bradenton.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bradenton Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_butler@bradenton.com", "name": "Alex Butler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Maurice", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Maurice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Press_International", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Press International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Montour", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Montour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Lorentz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steven Lorentz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksander_Barkov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aleksander Barkov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eetu_Luostarinen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eetu Luostarinen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Reinhart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Reinhart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Coyle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Coyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Girardi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Girardi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoff_format", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoff format"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Forsling", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gustav Forsling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/uovgv8/picture288431171/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/98e3887a-73ce-4db7-8f0a-16ee2c44ff38", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543724", "eventUri": "eng-9543724", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 5}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

The game was over; it was 6-1, so I gave it a go. He got what he wanted.\"\n\nPastrnak landed a couple of swings before he lost his footing and Tkachuk took him down.

But Jim Montgomery then watched Game 2 slip out of his club's hands with a stretch that featured three goals in the opening 11:58 of the third, including the final two coming in a 1:06 span.\n\nAnd then off came the gloves, and while just about every player got in on the shenanigans, it was a nasty third headlined by a scrap between the Bruins' David Pastrnak and Florida's Matthew Tkachuk.\n\nIt was not a fight that's going to make a Halftime Pizza highlight reel some 20 years from now, but Pastrnak's willingness to go, especially as a non-fighter, was not lost on his team.\n\n\"It's gonna be a series, and what I'm really proud of? I'm proud of Pasta,\" Montgomery said following the series-tying loss at Sunrise's Amerant Bank Arena. \"Because there's so many guys out there pushing after whistle and the linesman are there [but] Pasta and Tkachuk, they just went out there and fought. That's what you like. You like your hockey players to be competitors.\"\n\n\"I mean, you don't see that often,\" B's captain Brad Marchand offered. \"It's great for him to step up. I mean, you know, he doesn't fight often. He's actually pretty tough.\"\n\nIt was also a fight that Pastrnak, who came into tonight's game with just one career fight (a Mar. 2018 scrap against Dan Girardi), didn't seem to run from, with Pastrnak appearing to agree to a scrap with Tkachuk before the two hit the ice after a run-in on their previous shift.\n\n\"He was asking me,\" Pastrnak confirmed. \"So I felt like, I'd step up.\"\n\nPastrnak also expressed that he was willing to 'step up' for his team because at that point the game was over, and it was about message-sending more than anything else at that point in the night. Pastrnak also made it clear that he didn't have any sort of reservations about taking on a customer like Tkachuk.\n\n\"Well, I mean, you are in the game [and] it's a lot of emotions,\" Pastrnak said of taking on Tkachuk (24 fights in his NHL career). \"I'm not afraid of him. I can take a punch.\"\n\nIf there was one thing the Bruins had a problem with, however, it was Tkachuk throwing extra punches at Pastrnak after Pastrnak had fallen down, which is typically frowned upon when it comes to \"The Code.\"\n\nPastrnak opted not to comment on that part of it, and Montgomery made his feelings on the matter known without saying enough to get himself in any potential trouble with the league.\n\n\"It's not part of the game, for me,\" Montgomery said of Tkachuk's extra shots. \"But I'm not going to comment on players on other teams. I just worry about my own players.\"\n\nPanthers head coach Paul Maurice, meanwhile, called the Pastrnak-Tkachuk \"awesome,\" and added that he believes that the brewing Bruins-Panthers rivalry is great for the NHL.\n\nAnd with the intensity of this series ratcheted up, it's perhaps only fitting that it'll make its way to a surely-rowdy TD Garden for what will be a Friday night Game 3 showdown.", "source": {"uri": "985thesportshub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "98.5 The Sports Hub - Boston's Home For Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ty_anderson@985thesportshub.com", "name": "Ty Anderson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriy_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andriy Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Forsling", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gustav Forsling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Girardi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Girardi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Maurice", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Maurice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://985thesportshub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/88/2024/05/USATSI_23224283_168399896_lowres.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543724", "eventUri": "eng-9543724", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-03-", "textStart": 1499, "textEnd": 1508}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

He is usually happy to oblige.\n\n\"You're going to see that on the highlights over and over and over again,\" Florida Panthers coach Paul Maurice said. \"I think it's a good thing. You have two elite offensive players. Chucky's a 100-point guy all day long. Pastrnak's just this brilliant player. It's the playoffs. They each have their team. They got their brothers in their room. It's a little spicy out there. I think it's awesome. When it was over, they both looked like they were fine. Sorry for whoever's offended by that concept. I don't care. I thought it was awesome. Like, good on both of them.\"\n\nTheir fight cards are not even. On March 29, 2018, Pastrnak recorded his lone career fight against Dan Girardi, partly out of retribution for an illegal hit the right wing delivered previously to the New York Rangers defenseman.\n\nTkachuk, meanwhile, has his gloves off nearly as often as his mouthguard tangles from his lips. According to HockeyFights, the Florida Panthers rabble-rouser has 20 regular-season scraps to his name.\n\nBut at 12:42 of the third period, after Pastrnak gave Tkachuk the green light, the two superstars tangled at center ice. Tkachuk landed the best thump -- a right hand that jolted Pastrnak's helmet off his head.\n\nPastrnak didn't mind.\n\n\"You are in the game. There's a lot of emotions,\" Pastrnak said when asked why he agreed to go with Tkachuk. \"I'm not afraid of him, to be honest. I can take a punch. I'd do anything for these guys here.\"\n\nPlayers like Pastrnak are considered free of bare-knuckled obligations. Pastrnak is paid $11.25 million annually to score overtime goals like he did in Game 7 against the Toronto Maple Leafs. He does his best work with his gloves protecting his golden-goal hands.\n\nBut there come times when pride sets in. The Panthers were kicking in the Bruins' teeth at the time of Tkachuk's ask. They were laying a 6-1 beating on the Bruins.\n\n\"He was asking me, so I felt like I had to step up also,\" Pastrnak said. \"Game was over, 6-1. So we'll give it a go.\"\n\nPastrnak is left-handed. So he tried to start the fight by setting up his left to throw. But once he missed with his first left-handed punch, Tkachuk grabbed Pastrnak and went to work. Pastrnak went down to his knees. Tkachuk belted him in the face. Tkachuk followed up with several more cuffs after linesmen Scott Cherrey and Ryan Gibbons jumped in. Pastrnak squirmed out of the pile, got to his skates and tried to get in his own shots.\n\nTkachuk knows how to handle himself in a fight. Conversely, Pastrnak's inexperience could have gotten him hurt. He didn't care.\n\n\"I'm proud of Pasta,\" coach Jim Montgomery said. \"There's so many guys out there, pushing after the whistle when the linesmen are there. Pasta and Tkachuk, they just went out there and fought. That's what you like. You like your hockey players to be competitors.\"\n\nMarchand did not see the fight. He was in the dressing room with Maroon, Brazeau, Frederic and McAvoy. But the captain appreciated how Pastrnak felt the need to answer Tkachuk's challenge.\n\n\"It's great for him to step up,\" Marchand said. \"He doesn't fight often. He's actually pretty tough. But you don't want to see a guy like that get hurt. Hopefully he didn't. When guys go down, they can blow out shoulders and hurt hands. Great job by him stepping up. That's what he does.\"\n\nThat the temperature had spiked so hot was no surprise. The Bruins and Panthers do not like each other. The Panthers rallied from a 3-1 first-round deficit to end the Bruins' historic run last year. The Bruins won all four regular-season meetings this year, plus Game 1 on Monday.\n\nAdd on a head-bashing like the Panthers applied to the Bruins, and it's no wonder mayhem ignited. When it was 4-1, Maroon struck the first match by getting into it with Nick Cousins.\n\nThirty-eight seconds later, the entire third line of van Riemsdyk, Frederic and Brazeau was next to go after Sergei Bobrovsky covered the puck.\n\nAfter Brandon Montour scored the Panthers' sixth goal, Marchand had seen enough. As Cherrey and Gibbons busted up their tilt, Montour wagged his tongue at Marchand, taunting him for his lick of Ryan Callahan.\n\n\"He was just yelling,\" Marchand said when asked why he went after Montour. \"It's not a big deal.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fluto_shinzawa@theathletic.com", "name": "Fluto Shinzawa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriy_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andriy Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Girardi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Girardi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Maurice", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Maurice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouthguard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mouthguard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Rangers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Rangers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Montour", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Montour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Bobrovsky", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Bobrovsky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_van_Riemsdyk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James van Riemsdyk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Callahan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Callahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_skate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ice skate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_puck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hockey puck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/05/09000041/USATSI_23224375-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543724", "eventUri": "eng-9543724", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-03-29", "textStart": 748, "textEnd": 762}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

After watching several Bruins teammates receive 10-minute misconducts earlier in the third period, Pastrnak accepted a challenge from Tkachuk and dropped the gloves.\n\nThe four-time All-Star was spotted chatting with Jim Montgomery on the Boston bench before signaling to Tkachuk that he was ready to go. But as he revealed to the media after the Bruins' 6-1 loss, Pastrnak wasn't asking his head coach for the green light to fight.\n\n\"I just told him that I was going on the ice,\" Pastrnak told reporters, as seen on NESN's postgame coverage. \"I didn't ask him.\"\n\nMontgomery confirmed Pastrnak didn't ask him for permission to fight Tkachuck.

Cameras showed Montgomery seemingly giving Pastrnak the nod to mix it up with Tkachuk shortly before the two went after one another.\n\nMontgomery denied he offered explicit permission, but he wasn't upset over Pastrnak getting physical in the Bruins' eventual 6-1 loss that tied the series as it moves to Boston for Game 3 on Friday.\n\n\"I'm really proud of Pasta,\" Montgomery said. \"He just went out there and fought. You like your hockey players to be competitors.\"\n\nWhat Montgomery didn't appreciate was the added hits he thought Tkachuk got in as Pastrnak went to the ice.\n\n\"That's not part of the game to me,\" Montgomery said.\n\nFor his part, Florida coach Paul Maurice felt the scrap was a positive.\n\n\"I thought it was awesome,\" Maurice said.\n\nBoth Tkachuk and Pastrnak received penalties for fighting and a game misconduct. But as Pastrnak blatantly admitted after the final whistle, \"The game was over.\"\n\nIt was a difficult night all around for Boston, which sustained its most lopsided loss of the postseason. The Bruins started well, with Charlie Coyle offering them a 1-0 lead through 20 minutes. But it was all Florida from there, as the Panthers scored six unanswered goals to secure their first victory of the series.\n\nBoston had been enjoying sensational goaltending by Jeremy Swayman throughout the playoffs -- he entered Game 2 with a 5-2 record, .955 save percentage and 1.42 goals against average -- but Montgomery pulled Swayman early in the third after he allowed the fourth Panthers goal. Swayman, who hadn't given up more than two goals in a playoff contest to that point, was replaced by Linus Ullmark in his first action since Game 2 of Boston's first-round series against the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nMontgomery didn't think the downturn had to do with Swayman, though, as much as the Bruins having played their starter in six of seven games through a first-round series that ended Saturday and again in Monday's Game 1 -- during which Swayman was exceptional in making 38 stops in the win.\n\n\"The workload played into our effort tonight,\" Montgomery said. \"We didn't have juice tonight. Swayman was terrific.

Cameras showed Montgomery seemingly giving Pastrnak the nod to mix it up with Tkachuk shortly before the two went after one another.\n\nMontgomery denied he offered explicit permission but he wasn't upset over Pastrnak getting physical in the Bruins' eventual 6-1 loss that tied the series as it moves back to Boston for Game 3 on Friday.\n\n\"I'm really proud of Pasta,\" said Montgomery. \"He just went out there and fought.

But, as Pastrnak blatantly admitted after the final whistle, \"the game was over.\"\n\nIt was a difficult night all around for Boston, which sustained its most lopsided loss of the postseason. The Bruins started well, with Charlie Coyle offering them a 1-0 lead through 20 minutes. But it was all Florida from there, as the Panthers scored six unanswered goals to secure their first victory of the series.\n\nBoston had been enjoying sensational goaltending by Jeremy Swayman throughout the postseason -- he entered Game 2 with a 5-2 record, .955 save percentage and 1.42 goals against average -- but Montgomery pulled Swayman early in the third after he allowed the fourth Panthers' goal. Swayman -- who hadn't given up more than two goals in a playoff contest to that point -- was replaced by Linus Ullmark in his first action since Game 2 of Boston's first-round series against Toronto.\n\nMontgomery didn't think the downturn had to do with Swayman, though, as much as the Bruins having played their starter in six of seven games through a first-round series that just ended on Saturday and again during Game 1 on Monday, where Swayman was exceptional in making 38 stops in the win.\n\n\"The workload played into our effort tonight,\" Montgomery said. \"We didn't have juice tonight.

Quite literally.\n\nIt's no surprise that tempers were high late in Game 2 on Wednesday, with the Panthers taking a 6-1 lead with about eight minutes left in the game. There had already been a handful of scrums and skirmishes in the period, and it felt like more were brewing.\n\nWhat was surprising was Boston's half of the fisticuffs that broke out with just over seven minutes to play. For just the second time in his career, David Pastrnak threw down his gloves and had himself a dance. His dance partner -- Florida star/instigator extraordinaire Matthew Tkachuk -- is no stranger to fighting, and it showed in the brief tussle between the two star players.\n\nPastrnak clearly didn't appreciate the extra punches that Tkachuk threw while he was on the ice, and threw of few of his own after the refs had Tkachuk pinned down. Both players were given fighting penalties and game misconducts, and joined the slew of players on both sides that were already given an early exit from the game.\n\nThis was a premeditated fight, as Pastrnak was spotted on the Boston bench letting head coach Jim Montgomery know he was going to throw down with Tkachuk. While most head coaches probably don't want their best scorer to start throwing around fists -- or more importantly, have fists thrown at them -- Montgomery applauded Pastrnak after the loss.\n\n\"I'm really proud of Pasta,\" said Montgomery. \"There's so many guys out there pushing after the whistle when the linesmen are there. Pasta and Tkachuk, they just went out there and fought. That's what you like. You like your hockey players to be competitors.\"\n\nFlorida head coach Paul Maurice agreed with Montgomery.\n\n\"I thought it was awesome,\" said Maurice.\n\nPastrnak admitted after that he isn't a fighter, but also said he isn't afraid of Tkachuk, who has over two dozen fights under his belt over his NHL career.\n\n\"I can take a punch,\" Pasta said.\n\nPunches were flying everywhere in the third period, as the two teams racked up 136 penalty minutes over the final 10 minutes of the contest. It seemed like something was breaking out with every stoppage in play, and six players from each side were ultimately given early trips to the dressing room: Pastrnak, Brad Marchand, Charlie McAvoy, Justin Brazeau, Trent Frederic, and Pat Maroon of Boston, and Tkachuk, Nick Cousins, Eetu Loustarinen, Dmitry Kulikov, Niko Mikkola, and Sam Reinhart on the Florida side.\n\nA giant fracas preceded the Pastrnak-Tkachuk bout, after Brandon Montour scored Florida's six goal of the night and decided to really celebrate it in front of Brad Marchand. The B's captain didn't like it, and all sorts of tomfoolery followed on the ice. It resulted in four of the 12 misconducts handed out on the evening.\n\nUnfortunately for the Bruins, that was the only real juice they had in Game 2, and now they'll head back to Boston with the series tied 1-1. But they should have plenty of juice when things shift to the TD Garden on Friday night, thanks to Pastrnak's uncharacteristic tussle with Tkachuk.\n\nTaking on Tkachuk wasn't about winning a fight for Pastrnak. It was about stepping up and standing up for his teammates, who were being taunted and swung at by Panthers all night. It was about sending a message that the Bruins weren't going to let the Panthers push them around anymore.\n\nThese two teams clearly do not like each other, going back to last postseason, when Florida ended Boston's historic season in the first round. Add in Wednesday night's extracurricular activities on both sides, and it should set up an entertaining Game 3 in Boston on Friday night.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Maurice", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Maurice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Kulikov_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dmitry Kulikov (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niko_Mikkola", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Niko Mikkola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Reinhart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Reinhart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Frederic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Frederic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Montour", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Montour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Maroon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Maroon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_McAvoy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie McAvoy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/09/47fe1b8b-0717-44fb-8af2-78200ee24dcb/thumbnail/1200x630g2/f98136169746b11aaf2894fa106160d9/david-pastrnak.jpg?v=3a71db5e6dd1c027f95668a1c7b6fcaf", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543724", "eventUri": "eng-9543724", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

The Panthers alternate captain managed to bring the Bruins star down to the ice, which typically signals the end of a bout.

But Pastrnak cooled off by the time the dust settled on the Bruins' 6-1 loss, simply explaining he fought Tkachuk as a means of stepping up for his team.\n\nThe best-of-seven series, tied at one game apiece, now shifts to Boston, where Bruins fans will be eager to give Tkachuk an earful Friday evening.

Yes", "body": "Late in the third period of a game that his team was losing badly, David Pastrnak figured he'd had enough.\n\nThe Florida Panthers were pouring it on, having just scored their sixth goal of the night. They were going to win Game 2 and even the series. They were letting the Boston Bruins know about it too, with Matthew Tkachuk choosing the moment to show off his formidable trash-talking skills.\n\nAt some point, Pastrnak decided he'd handle it according to whatever version of hockey's fabled Code was in effect in the moment. And that meant hand-to-hand combat.\n\nIt was only the second time Pastrnak has ever had a fight in the NHL, according to HockeyFights. Tkachuk has far more experience in that area, with multiple fights in each of the past seven seasons. His brother Brady fights even more. His dad Keith did, too. It's what the Tkachuk boys do: They score, they tell you about it, and occasionally they drop the gloves and trade punches with anyone who has a problem with it.\n\nPastrnak was well out of his element. But he apparently decided that somebody needed to shut Tkachuk up, or at least try. And as the Bruins' star and highest-paid player, just days removed from scoring the Game 7 overtime winner that put Boston in this series in the first place, Pastrnak chose not to let anyone else handle business. He and Tkachuk discussed it during a break in play, a challenge was issued and accepted, and an agreement was reached. The next time the two stars stepped on the ice, they ignored the puck and headed directly for each other.\n\nAll things considered, Pastrnak did OK. He didn't win the fight -- even the most diehard Bruins fan couldn't claim that -- but The Code says he didn't have to. He showed up. And he seemed to escape unscathed, skating away from that scrap looking no worse for wear. He almost didn't, with Tkachuk throwing some haymakers that just missed. If one of those lands, there's no way of knowing what kind of damage it does. It's not inconceivable that Pastrnak could be out for a game, or the series, or the playoffs, or more.\n\nSo what was it? An example of a superstar showing the kind of leadership that unites a team behind him? Or a stupid, reckless risk that could have ended in disaster?\n\nBoth. It was very obviously both.\n\nLook, if Pastrnak gets hurt, the stories write themselves. A team's best player getting hurt in a fight that absolutely didn't have to happen? Why, because he was mad that the other team wouldn't stop scoring? With a game already determined, and absolutely nothing left to gain on that night? Against a guy he knew would probably pummel him? It would be a ridiculous exercise in frustration, a selfish act, and almost certainly the end of the Bruins' quest for the Cup.\n\nHe didn't get hurt, at least as far as we know. He seemed fine in the room after the game, according to The Athletic's Bruins reporter Fluto Shinzawa. But he easily could have. Do you ever want to see your superstar take that kind of risk?\n\nWell ... yeah, you kind of do. You kind of love it.\n\nLook, I get that it might not make much sense to fans of other sports. It doesn't make sense to plenty of hockey fans either. And it sure won't make sense to plenty of media and commentators and talking heads, many of whom will shake their heads and tut-tut about how silly the whole Code thing can be. And they won't be wrong.\n\nBut also ... hell yeah, David Pastrnak, and I right?\n\nI'm sorry if that's the caveman side of me coming out. I grew up with a different era of hockey, and to this day I wrestle with how I cheered it on. I know that the right answer here is the same one I'd tell me kids: There's a better way to settle this stuff, so grow some thicker skin and don't be a dummy. That's how I'd want them to handle it on the playground.\n\nBut this wasn't the playground. It was an NHL playoff game, and the rules are different, including the unspoken ones. There isn't anywhere near as much fighting in the NHL as there once was, and it's way less than the fans of other sports seem to think. But there's still some. On Wednesday night, we saw one.\n\nAnd I'll be honest. When it was over and Pastrnak was skating off the ice, my first thought wasn't about how irresponsible he'd been, or what he'd risked, or how silly the whole spectacle was.\n\nIt was more along the lines of: Damn, I wish that guy was on my team.\n\nI'm pretty sure I wasn't alone. I'm absolutely sure that Bruins fans loved every second of it. I'd be willing to bet that even as the punches were still flying, there were group chats across the league lighting up. And I doubt too many of them were tut-tutting anyone.\n\nThat's the paradox in all this, at least for some of us. This stuff is the best, right up until we see the worst, which can happen any time. You never know. David Pastrnak is an adult, and he can decide if he wants to take that risk, because the NHL is the only major sports league that gives players that choice. Lots of people think it shouldn't be that way. But it is, at least for now, so we get Pastrnak and Tkachuk.\n\nMaybe when it happened, you quickly shut off your TV. Maybe it doesn't matter if you did or not. Or maybe we just saw a legend made, a Lecavalier versus Iginla for a new generation. Maybe if the Bruins win the series or even the Stanley Cup, this will be the moment everyone points to.\n\nEh. Strike that last \"maybe.\" We know that one's true.\n\nAnd maybe tomorrow we find out Pastrnak isn't at practice, that despite seeming fine, he's day-to-day. That's it's an upper body injury from one of those haymakers, or a blown-out knee from the fall, or something else. Do we all change our opinions then? Most of us probably do. That's hockey too.\n\nBut until then, Pastrnak made his choice, and he did what he felt like he had to do. You don't have to like it, and you don't have to ignore what could happen the next time somebody else makes that choice. But that may not matter in a Bruins dressing room where I'm guessing every one of his teammates would run through a wall for their guy right now.\n\nIt's playoff hockey. Not everyone gets it. Not everyone should.

In Game 2, it was the opposite story told. Florida stormed back to win Game 2 6-1 on Wednesday night. But what has fans talking is not the final score. Rather, fans are buzzing about the fight between Matthew Tkachuk and David Pastrnak.\n\nThe third period of Game 2 was an intense affair. Florida and Boston combined for 17 penalties in the final frame. Furthermore, the Panthers and Bruins each lost six players before time expired. Among the players ejected were Pastrnak and Tkachuk, who dropped the gloves mid-play to the delight of the live audience.\n\nMatthew Tkachuk is certainly no stranger to mixing it up. However, David Pastrnak is a bit of a different story. The Bruins star is one of his team's primary offensive producers. But he rarely sees time in the box. In fact, he had less than 50 penalty minutes during the 2023-24 regular season, and those 47 penalty minutes represent his career high for a single season.\n\nFans react to intense Panthers-Bruins game\n\nMatthew Tkachuk and David Pastrnak certainly weren't the only ones to mix it up in Game 2. Both Florida and Boston took it to the other during the final frame. And fans could not contain themselves on social media as the action on the ice unfolded in real-time. Some had fun with the festivities taking place.\n\nOther fans took the opportunity to talk a bit of smack. For instance, one fan focused in on the doubts around the Panthers after their loss in the first game. \"You hear that? That's the sound of everybody who talked smack about these Florida Panthers after game one shutting the f**k up,\" they wrote on social media.\n\nOne reporter posted a complete breakdown of the penalties taken in the third period. The Bruins took 10 total penalties against the Panthers. Meanwhile, Florida took seven penalties in the final frame of Game 2. The reporter stated the obvious in their post.\n\nFinally, one Bruins fan took aim at Matthew Tkachuk for choosing David Pastrnak as his opponent in the third period. \"BTW thats when Tkachuk will mix it up.

Wednesday night certainly did not go the same way as Game 1 on Monday. Boston fell by a score of 6-1 and now head home with the series tied at a game apiece. But everyone, including head coach Jim Montgomery, cannot stop talking about the brawl between David Pastrnak and Matthew Tkachuk.\n\nThe fight happened during the third period. Florida had already run away with the game in terms of the score. And the final period had been incredibly intense. The two superstar forwards came off the bench and immediately dropped the gloves. After the game, Montgomery told the media he was rather impressed with his star forward.\n\n\"What I'm really proud of is Pasta. There are so many guys out there pushing after the whistles when the linesmen is going to be there. They just went out there & fought. That's what you like,\" the Bruins head coach said, via Joe Haggerty of the Boston Sports Journal.\n\nBruins, Panthers rack up penalty minutes\n\nBoston and Florida certainly weren't exchanging friendly banter during the third period. Believe it or not, the first penalty of the third period didn't occur until the midway point. Bruins forward Pat Maroon was called for roughing and he received a game misconduct. Panthers forward Nick Cousins also received a misconduct at this time.\n\nAt 11:03 of the third period, things broke down. Florida rearguard Oliver Ekman-Larsson earned a cross-checking penalty. Another altercation broke out between the two teams. In the end, five players -- two from Florida and three from Boston -- were given game misconducts. At 11:58, another brawl broke out after the Panthers made it 6-1. This brawl led to another four misconducts.\n\nAt 12:42, Matthew Tkachuk and David Pastrnak dropped the gloves. Jim Montgomery and his team looked on as the two superstar forwards took their shots. They both eventually fell to the ice, but Pastrnak got back up. He proceeded to throw a few more punches at the Panthers forward while referees held him to the ice. Both players received a misconduct after the fight.\n\nDavid Pastrnak, others react\n\nDavid Pastrnak spoke with the media after his fight in Game 2 with Matthew Tkachuk. Inevitably, he was questioned on the fight in the third period. The Bruins superstar provided a rather straightforward answer in regards to his decision to drop the gloves on Wednesday night.\n\n\"It's a lot of emotions. I mean, I'm not afraid of him, to be honest,\" the Bruins superstar said of his fight, via BruinsDaily. \"I can take a puch and I'd do anything for these guys (in the locker room).\"\n\nPanthers goalie Sergei Bobrovsky was also asked about the scrap. He commended both parties for agreeing to throw hands when they did. \"A great fight. Two leaders going against each other. It's good for the game, for sure,\" he said, via Panthers senior digital content manager Jameson Olive.\n\nFlorida bench boss Paul Maurice is always one to give an interesting perspective. Regarding Game 2, however, he kept his thoughts on everything rather to the point. \"If you paid money to come to the rink tonight, you had a hell of a night,\" he said, via Olive.\n\nWhether David Pastrnak and Matthew Tkachuk drop the gloves again remains to be seen. However, the Panthers and Bruins are certainly putting on a show for fans. And fans will definitely want to tune into Game 3 on Friday when these teams fight to take a 2-1 lead in the series.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tristin_mckinstry@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Tristin McKinstry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Official (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Maroon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Maroon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Ekman-Larsson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Ekman-Larsson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-checking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cross-checking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Bobrovsky", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Bobrovsky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Maurice", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Maurice"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Boston-coachs-proud-reaction-to-David-Pastrnak-Matthew-Tkachuk-brawl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543724", "eventUri": "eng-9543724", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Murphy's statement, shared on X (formerly Twitter), has ignited discussions about the role of physicality and retribution in professional hockey.\n\n\"Some may call this advocating for violence, but it is what it is, The #NHLBruins need to make Matthew Tkachuk feel pain in Game 3. How that's done, I don't care. That's their choice, but it needs to happen,\" Murphy shared in his post on X\n\nThis statement alludes to a strong tradition among hockey fans of protesting the way players who play a rough game are treated by the management. Matthew Tkachuk, well-known for his taste for starting fights and crossing ethical lines, has many times found himself amid conflict and criticism.\n\nThe incident in question unfolded during the recent matchup between the Bruins and Panthers, as Pastrnak, displaying commendable resolve, engaged Tkachuk in a physical altercation towards the end of the game.\n\nHowever, Matthew Tkachuk's response crossed a line, as he delivered a shot on Pastrnak while the Bruins winger was prone on the ice.\n\nMatthew Tkachuk and Panthers' 6-1 win over Bruins\n\nIn a fiery matchup between the Florida Panthers and the Boston Bruins, the Panthers emerged victorious with a dominant 6-1 win, leveling the series at 1-1.\n\nAleksander Barkov led the way with two goals and two assists, and Sam Reinhart added four assists. Brandon Montour, Steven Lorentz, Gustav Forsling and Eetu Luostarinen all contributed to the Panthers' offensive onslaught.\n\nThe game took a physical turn in the third period, resulting in a total of 146 penalty minutes. Notably, a showdown between Matthew Tkachuk and David Pastrnak added fuel to the fire, resulting in misconduct for both players.\n\nDespite Boston's early efforts, Florida's dominance was evident, as they limited the Bruins to just one shot on goal for over 16 minutes. Bruins goaltender Jeremy Swayman, who had been solid throughout the playoffs, was replaced by Linus Ullmark after allowing four consecutive goals.\n\nThe Panthers' momentum carried into the third period, where they quickly extended their lead to 4-1. Barkov's setup for Luostarinen marked the end of Swayman's night, as Florida continued to pour on the pressure.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abhilasha_aditi@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Abhilasha Aditi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksander_Barkov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aleksander Barkov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eetu_Luostarinen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eetu Luostarinen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Reinhart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Reinhart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Montour", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Montour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Ullmark", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linus Ullmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Forsling", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gustav Forsling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/23207988-1715270700.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543724", "eventUri": "eng-9543724", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

LAUDERDALE -- One night after capturing the hockey world's attention by going head to head in a fight with David Pastrnak, the Florida Panthers' Matthew Tkachuk spoke Thursday about how much respect he had for the Boston Bruins' Game 7 first-round hero for accepting his invitation to fight -- and gave play by play as to how the rare star-vs.-star bout came about.\n\n\"I think it was just their bottom six guys were doing what they were doing, which I don't think we really liked on our side -- I guess they kind of started it there,\" Tkachuk said, smiling. \"I don't know, I guess I wanted in on the action. I asked him to fight. He said, 'We'll do it next game.' I'm like, 'Maybe we should just do it right now.' He's like, 'Alright, I'm going out next shift.'\n\n\"Give him tons of respect. Those are two guys that aren't known for fighting -- me and him -- and two players that are probably known more for the offensive side of the game.\"\n\nIn fact, as Tkachuk reminded, \"We were both up for the Hart last year and just to see ourselves battling at center ice in a playoff game, it's pretty cool. It's good for hockey. Both emotional guys that are leaders for our teams that really just want to show we'll do whatever it takes to win. We weren't going out there to play patty-cake or anything. We were going out there to have some fun in the fight and, I don't know, try to land some punches.\"\n\nThe fisticuffs came after a pair of massive after-whistle melees that resulted in the 10-minute misconducts of Boston's Pat Maroon, Justin Brazeau, Trent Frederic, Charlie McAvoy and Brad Marchand and Florida's Eetu Luostarinen, Dmitry Kulikov, Niko Mikkola, Nick Cousins and Sam Reinhart.\n\nAfter Tkachuk challenged Pastrnak to the fight, Pastrnak went to the bench for a line change so he could be fresh. You can see on video that he informed coach Jim Montgomery that he'd be fighting Tkachuk the next shift. Pastrnak said after the game he wasn't afraid of Tkachuk and insinuated it was time to take a stand with the Bruins getting beaten so badly.\n\n\"I can take a punch. I'd do anything for these guys here,\" Pastrnak said.\n\nTkachuk is a lot more experienced dropping the gloves than Pastrnak, but he quipped that he doesn't like to fight because his brother, Ottawa's Brady Tkachuk, and father, former NHLer Keith Tkachuk, \"say I'm not very good at it.\"\n\n\"During that moment, you can't even hear the crowd,\" Matthew Tkachuk said. \"You have no idea what you're even doing. You just kind of black out and throw as many punches as you can.\n\n\"It was a good fight.\"\n\nTkachuk's father was actually at the game and looked fired up after the fight. But when his son got the boot with an accompanying 10-minute misconduct, Matthew said his dad \"was just excited that he got to leave early. I think he was ready to get out of there.\"\n\nAs for Matthew, he said he went to the locker room and hung out with his fellow kicked-out teammates and the trainers.\n\nHe's in the midst of another terrific postseason, tied for the team lead with 10 points in seven games and, as coach Paul Maurice noted Thursday, continues to be disciplined, as shown when he didn't retaliate in the first period Wednesday after Marchand caught him with a monstrous, clean check.\n\n\"The true statement of that game is the hit he took from Marchand and (how he) got back up,\" Maurice said. \"He's just a gamer. He's just in on everything, but he's not starting fires out there, I don't think. He was a bit of an arsonist at the start of last year, and then that stopped.\"\n\nTkachuk said he can't wait for Game 3 and to hear how Bruins fans greet him and the Panthers, who upset the Bruins in seven games in last year's first round. There's a chance Sam Bennett could return for the first time since getting injured in Game 2 of the Tampa Bay series. Maurice said he'll take Friday's full morning skate, and then they'll decide.\n\n\"It's going to be good. It's Friday night in Boston,\" Tkachuk said. \"Playoffs, I mean, there's going to be a lot of energy in the rink. Two teams that are very familiar with each other and two teams that really want to win. This is a really good series right now.\n\n\"We've seen it last year in the playoffs. They weren't too happy with us going back for Game 5 and especially Game 7. We're used to the hatred as an away team, especially our team now with a little bit of a rivalry that's being created here. We go and we just play. That's what makes us good. We don't care where we play, who we play. We just play and we have fun doing it. So hopefully the crowd fires us up.\"\n\nAs for carryover, Tkachuk doesn't expect that.\n\n\"We've got to try to ride the momentum of winning the last game, but in playoffs, it's almost like whatever happens the game prior -- win or lose, crazy, boring, whatever it is -- it's a clean, fresh slate that next game.\n\n\"Now it's a best of five, and they technically have home ice now, so it's up to us to win Friday to get home ice back.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_russo@theathletic.com", "name": "Michael Russo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keith Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Kulikov_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dmitry Kulikov (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niko_Mikkola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Niko Mikkola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eetu_Luostarinen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eetu Luostarinen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Reinhart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Reinhart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brady Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Frederic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trent Frederic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Maroon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Maroon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Maurice", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Maurice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_McAvoy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie McAvoy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bennett_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bennett (ice hockey)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby_Showers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby Showers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/05/09142721/GettyImages-2044291978-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543724", "eventUri": "eng-9543724", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Flashing a thumbs-up and a smile, Keith Tkachuk seemingly embraced the physicality displayed by his son and Pastrnak.\n\nMeanwhile, amidst the on-ice drama, Bruins captain Brad Marchand delivered a standout moment with a thunderous yet clean hit on Matthew Tkachuk in the first period of the game.\n\nAs the series progresses, anticipation continues to build for Game 3, scheduled for Friday in Boston.\n\nMatthew Tkachuk watches as Panthers dominate Bruins 6-1\n\nThe Boston Bruins faced a tough outing against the Florida Panthers in Game 2 with a 6-1 defeat. The game ignited at 12:12 in the opening period when Boston's Charlie Coyle capitalized on a turnover, netting the first goal of the night. However, the Panthers swiftly retaliated in the second period, as Lorentz found the back of the net at 1:56, drawing the score even.\n\nAs the game progressed, the Panthers asserted their dominance. Barkov seized the lead for Florida at 9:49, converting a rebound opportunity with precision. Forsling extended their advantage with a well-placed one-timer just before the period's close, leaving the Bruins trailing 3-1.\n\nEntering the final frame, Luostarinen widened the gap at 1:28, capitalizing on a rebound from Reinhart's setup. Barkov then solidified the Panthers' dominance with his second goal of the night, a power-play marker at 10:52.\n\nDespite a valiant effort by Boston, the Panthers sealed their victory with Montour's short-handed strike at 11:58, finishing with an emphatic 6-1 scoreline.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arnab_mondal@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Arnab Mondal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevhen_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yevhen Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keith Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcer_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enforcer (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(punishment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suspension (punishment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksander_Barkov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aleksander Barkov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Coyle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Coyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-handed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Short-handed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Icebreaker_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Icebreaker Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/653a8-17152252827103-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543724", "eventUri": "eng-9543724", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Tempers flared in the second, but got even chippier in the third period with 11 game misconducts before Pastrnak and Tkachuk were each assessed a misconduct.\n\nWith the series now tied at 1-1, the Panthers go to Boston for Games 3 and 4. Despite the win and a slew of momentum on their side, Maurice doesn't think how things transpired Wednesday -- particularly Tkachuk and Pastrnak's fight -- will impact the Bruins in a negative way.\n\n\"It won't change a thing. But, man, I think it's a good thing,\" Maurice said. \"You got two elite offensive players. (Tkachuk) is a 100-point guy all day long, Pastrnak's just this brilliant player. And they each have their team, right? They got their brothers in the room, gets a little spicy out there and they wanna go. I think it was awesome. I think when it was over, they both looked like they were fine. Sorry by whoever's offended by that concept, I don't care. I thought it was awesome.\"\n\nBruins coach Jim Montgomery wasn't thrilled with Tkachuk throwing an extra punch at Pastrnak's head, noting he believes it's \"not part of the game.\"\n\nIt will be interesting to see if any tension boils over for the remainder of the series, which continues Friday night at TD Garden for Game 3.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevhen_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yevhen Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Maurice", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paul Maurice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby_Showers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby Showers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.masslive.com/resizer/v2/GLFW7IEJCFHUVETTTBNV6N7OMI.jpg?auth=b5d7243f028a7a6f3b80ceac5d58c681dad257d88877a39ede09ed2b2bffb139&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543724", "eventUri": "eng-9543724", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The four-time All-Star wasn't actively looking to brawl, but he accepted the challenge in the third period when Matthew Tkachuk came calling.\n\nTkachuk, who's far more prone to fight, got the better of his counterpart, including a cheap shot that drew the ire of Jim Montgomery. Pastrnak after the game didn't make much of the scrap, but he did note how he didn't set himself up for success.\n\n\"I'm not a very experienced fighter,\" Pastrnak told reporters, as seen on NESN's postgame coverage. \"I fell down, it's on me. I wish I approached it a little better, but as I said, I haven't been in many of those.\"\n\nAs far as the Bruins are concerned, the result of the fight probably didn't matter much.

It's far from Pastrnak's forte.\n\nBut after Panthers wing Matthew Thachuk challenged him in the waning minutes of Wednesday's Game 2 matchup, Pastrnak did not hesitate.\n\nIt was far from an even fight, given Tkachuk's pugnacious reputation. While Pastrnak had just one career fight on his resume entering Wednesday night, the Panthers power forward has 20 fights during regular-season action.\n\nBut Pastrnak had few regrets over his scrap with Tkachuk, even if one of his opponent's right jabs popped the Bruins' forward's bucket off his head.\n\nWith few positives to be gleaned from Wednesday's 6-1 loss to Florida, Pastrnak tried to set the tone for Friday's Game 3 rematch -- and the rest of a second-round series that's already brewing with plenty of bad blood.\n\n\"You are in the game. There's a lot of emotions,\" Pastrnak said of his third-period fight. \"I'm not afraid of him, to be honest. I can take a punch. I'd do anything for these guys here.\"\n\nThe scrap between two of hockey's top talents punctuated a night where the Bruins and Panthers teamed up for a whopping 158 penalty minutes and 12 total game misconducts.\n\n\"You're going to see that on the highlights over and over and over again,\" Florida Panthers coach Paul Maurice said. \"I think it's a good thing. You have two elite offensive players. Chucky's a 100-point guy all day long.\n\n\"Pastrnak's just this brilliant player. It's the playoffs. They each have their team. They got their brothers in their room. It's a little spicy out there. I think it's awesome. When it was over, they both looked like they were fine. Sorry for whoever's offended by that concept. I don't care. I thought it was awesome. Like, good on both of them.\"\n\nFor Tkachuk, a decisive win over Boston's top playmaking talent served as the emphatic stamp on a dominant win for the Panthers.\n\nFor Pastrnak, it was both an avenue to vent frustrations over a lopsided loss -- and send a message that this roster is not going to be easily pushed around when the temperature rises in this series.\n\n\"I'm proud of Pasta,\" Jim Montgomery said. \"There's so many guys out there, pushing after the whistle when the linesmen are there. Pasta and Tkachuk, they just went out there and fought. That's what you like. You like your hockey players to be competitors.\"\n\nPastrnak was far from the only player sent to the showers early at Amerant Bank Arena on Wednesday.\n\nPat Maroon and Nick Cousins sparked a third period filled with chaos after both skaters were tossed from the game at 10:25. Just 38 seconds later, a full line brawl led to Justin Brazeau, Trent Frederic, Dmitry Kulikov, and Eetu Luostarinen getting shown the door.\n\nAfter Panthers blueliner Brandon Montour capped the scoring with a shorthanded goal at 11:58, he directed his screams of triumph right into Brad Marchand's face.\n\nAs expected, Boston's captain didn't take too kindly to Montour's exuberance. Marchand was sent off for his fight with Montour, with the Panthers defenseman mocking Marchand by sticking out his tongue at him -- a clear reference to Marchand's licking incident with Ryan Callahan in 2018.\n\nMarchand was in the locker room when Pastrnak dropped the gloves with Tkachuk less than a minute later. But he was impressed by his teammate's response against a tougher foe.\n\n\"You don't see that often,\" Marchand said. \"It's great for him to step up. I mean, he doesn't fight often. He's actually pretty tough. But you don't want to see a guy like that get hurt. So hopefully he didn't. When guys go down, they can blow out shoulders and hurt hands and all that. So great job by him stepping up.\"\n\nThe Stanley Cup Playoffs naturally draws out vitriol and snarl over the course of a seven-game series. But the Bruins and Panthers were already on bellicose terms entering this playoff showdown.\n\nThe Bruins are still steaming over last year's first-round exit at the hands of Tkachuk and the Panthers. Florida is at its best when they're throwing their weight around and pestering opponents after the whistle.\n\nWednesday's fight night at Amerant Bank Arena ratched up the intensity of this series. But it won't be the end of said hostilities -- not in the slightest.\n\n\"I think we're built a little different this year, probably in a little bit better position to push back physically,\" Marchand said of this Bruins roster. \"You can see that we're a little bit bigger throughout the lineup and a little more physical. That's what they bring every night. So we gotta keep going.\"", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conor_ryan@boston.com", "name": "Conor Ryan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Maroon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Maroon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Maurice", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Maurice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Kulikov_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dmitry Kulikov (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eetu_Luostarinen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eetu Luostarinen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Frederic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Frederic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Montour", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Montour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-handed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Short-handed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Callahan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Callahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_in_ice_hockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fighting in ice hockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/QOOCY6YKJZA72SAFC6ZLDL7VNU-663c6ca624009-768x432.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543724", "eventUri": "eng-9543724", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The Florida Panthers ran the B's out of the building to the tune of a 6-1 drubbing to even their second-round Stanley Cup playoffs series at a game apiece.\n\nIt's what happened late in that game and after the heated contest that's sparking conversation a day later, though. Specifically, Bruins superstar David Pastrnak's decision to drop the gloves with Florida's Matthew Tkachuk in the waning minutes of an already-decided game. Tkachuk, far more comfortable with his inner pugilist, got the better of Pastrnak, connecting with a clean punch before Pastrnak lost his footing.\n\nHowever, the Bruins sniper got up and went back for more, and then after the game, he declared he wasn't afraid of Tkachuk, stating he can take a punch. Rupp, who made his living as a tough guy who could handle himself with gloves on the ice, absolutely loved what Pastrnak did.\n\n\"David Pastrnak, the way he goes out there, squares off, comes off the bench and fights? Are you kidding me? And his postgame comments: 'I'm not afraid of Matthew Tkachuk ... I can take a punch. ... I'll do anything for these guys.' Goosebumps,\" Rupp said in a video he posted Thursday morning to X.\n\nRupp argued that Pastrnak's decision to take matters into his own hands sends an important message to everyone inside the Bruins' dressing room as the series progresses.\n\n\"As a depth guy, to know the stud, the guy who could be up for MVP ... when you get that kind of support, that the superstar is in the fight, it lifts you up, man. All of a sudden, I'm like, 'Look out for this Bruins team.' They're not dead. They're not down.

About the series, about his play and about the Bruins' 2023-24 season.\n\nHis goal less than two minutes into overtime of Game 7 on Saturday night cast all of it in a different light and pushed the Bruins past the Maple Leafs into the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs.\n\n\"It's a huge moment, obviously,\" said Pastrnak, whose goal was the third fastest Game 7 overtime goal in history. \"A lot of excitement. A little relief as well.\"\n\nIf Game 7s are a balance beam, an overtime in Game 7 is a tightrope. The consequences of falling off are always awful. For this Bruins team, it would have been particularly so. They were facing back-to-back playoff collapses that would have cemented their legacy as chokers. Instead, they stuck the landing and advanced.\n\nIt was a defining moment for Pastrnak, who'd had a rough series through six games. If the Bruins had lost he'd have been the public face of their historic failure -- a highly-paid star who didn't deliver when it mattered most. Even coach Jim Montgomery, whose aggressive positivity has defined his two-year tenure, called Pastrnak out after Game 6.\n\n\"Your best players need to be your best players this time of year,\" Montgomery said. \"Pasta needs to step up.\"\n\nThe coach hasn't employed that kind of tactic often. And Pastrnak rarely gets publicly criticized. There was some question of what his reaction would be and how he'd respond.\n\n\"I told him if I'm the coach and you were me, I would say the same thing,\" Pastrnak said. \"I had no problem with him saying that. I admitted I need to be better. I still have ways to be better.\"\n\nHis winning goal gave him a chance to try to continue that.\n\n\"I thought he was dynamic tonight,\" Montgomery said. \"He was creating shots. Taking what was available and not forcing things.\"\n\nThe game, at least through 60 minutes of regulation, still wasn't peak Pastrnak. He remained a little tentative and not nearly as crisp or clever as he usually is. But none of that matters now.\n\nHampus Lindholm, another maligned Bruin, sent the puck into the zone. It caromed to Pastrnak, who'd gotten behind the defense. Flicking his stick like a fencer, Pastrnak moved the puck from his forehand to his backhand. Ilya Samsonov never had a chance. Pastrnak flipped the puck over the Toronto goalie into the net and redefined his legacy in the series all in one motion.\n\nThis is no longer the series where Pastrnak struggled, but the one where he was the hero.\n\nIt wasn't just his own story that was changed. Pastrnak's goal changed the narrative for everyone.\n\nInstead of talking about the historic implications of a collapse or whether Montgomery might get fired because of it, the Bruins can talk about Florida.\n\nTheir redemption in the first round gave them a chance at getting more against the Panthers. They earned the right to never know how bad it would have been.\n\n\"If you lose, you catch a lot of heat and if you win, then nobody talks about dropping a couple of games,\" Brad Marchand said. \"It's happened multiple times in the past where we've been up 3-1 and we've won the series and no one said a word about it. You talk about the win.

Click here to join the fun.\n\nFor most, sports are about the positives: teamwork, joy, bringing people together, the human spirit, all that. But sometimes, sports are really just about hate.\n\nAnd boy, do the Bruins and Panthers hate each other.\n\nIn case you missed it, Boston got smoked by Florida in Game 2 last night. Here's a list of players who got thrown out (let me take a deep breath): Pat Maroon, Justin Brazeau, Trent Frederic, Brad Marchand, Charlie McAvoy, David Pastrnak, Eetu Luostarinen, Sam Reinhart, Nick Cousins, Dmitry Kulikov, Niko Mikkola, and Matthew Tkachuk.\n\nI'm not even sure Pastrnak actually got tossed; but he and Tkachuk, the respective superstars from each team, dropped the gloves in the third period having seemingly agreed to bout terms, venue, prize money splits, etc. ahead of time. Once it was over, Pastrnak went straight down the tunnel without bothering to wait for an official ejection.\n\nSo, yeah, there's a lot to go over. Let's get into it (the newsletter, not a fight).\n\nAfter blowing out the Panthers in a Game 1 upset, the Bruins had to stomach a blowout loss of their own in a 6-1 defeat that evened the series.\n\nThings got ugly in a hurry in the third period as the game slipped away from Boston, and it seemed like we were stopping for a scrap (and a couple game misconducts) every couple of minutes.\n\nIt wasn't all about the fighting; Boston simply couldn't stop coughing the puck up in bad areas, doing goaltender Jeremy Swayman no favors as he had his first tough night of this posteason. Swayman was pulled in the third period, but it's hard to pin much blame on him.\n\nThe series shifts back to Boston for Game 3 on Friday night and Jim Montgomery has a lot of work to do: the power play has been stagnant, Florida's forecheck looks dominant, and the Panthers might just believe Swayman is mortal.\n\nMomentum can shift in a hurry.\n\nUp next: The Celtics host the Cavaliers for Game 2 of the Eastern Conference semifinals tonight at 7 p.m. You can catch the game on ESPN. The Celtics tell us they're in their white association jerseys tonight -- the classics.\n\nThe Bruins are back at TD Garden for Game 3 against the Panthers on Friday, with puck drop set for 7:30 p.m. on TNT.\n\nAmin: There was plenty not to like from a Bruins perspective in Game 2. What aspect of this loss do you think will concern Jim Montgomery the most as the series shifts back to Boston?\n\nMatt: The lack of quality in the defensive zone. Light on confidence, quickness, and guile, the Bruins looked nothing like the team that showed up in Game 1. Which could speak to a larger issue.\n\nAfter carrying the play for the first 10 to 15 minutes, they looked tired. While they'll probably resist the narrative that they're sagging after taking every bit of seven games to kick the Maple Leafs out of the way, it sure does seem like they need a rest. Or at least a reset, and a fired-up Friday night home crowd in Game 3.\n\nAlso: 146 combined hits in a hockey game is quite a lot. Bruins better hope all that physicality took something out of the Panthers, too.\n\nConor: I agree with Matt -- it's the Bruins' D-zone lapses and struggles with execution when it comes to breaking pucks out of their own zone.\n\nWednesday's loss felt like a retreaded script from last year's crushing first-round exit, where several errant passes, lazy clears, and poor reads made things far too easy for a Panthers team that has the skill to snarl to pounce on just about every mistake the opposition commits.\n\nThe Bruins had chances in the first period against Sergei Bobrovsky, while both their goaltending (I'm not faulting Swayman in this one) and PK is still looking strong.\n\nBut the Bruins aren't going to reverse last year's narrative if this team continues to cough up the puck in their own end.\n\nIf you've got tickets for tonight or this weekend at the Garden, you better get there with an empty stomach.\n\nThe fine folks at the venue gave us a heads up about the new concession items for the second-round games, and it's hard to believe they've outdone themselves.\n\nDoes your business have something exciting happening for the playoffs? Email us at gardenparty@globe.com \ud83c\udf89\n\nYeah, it's more about the fighting. Don't blame me, I didn't punch anyone last night.\n\nWith a deeply chaotic Game 2 in the books, here's a completely unscientific ranking of the five funniest moments from a very unserious third period.\n\n5. Look, if you're Brad Marchand, and you've been instigating nonstop since you came into the league, you've got to be willing to take it. Brandon Montour decided to celebrate his third-period goal directly in Marchand's face, Marchand decided to get extremely mad about it, Montour pretended to lick him, and the tone was really set from a maturity perspective for the rest of the evening.\n\n4. As it turns out, when half the players get thrown out of the game, the benches start looking extremely silly when they're half empty.\n\n3. So, I guess Panthers fans have a tradition of throwing fake rats onto the ice? Which is definitely strange, but it was hard not to laugh as Pastrnak and Tkachuk are throwing haymakers at each other and a plastic rat just goes flying past them. This game was a fever dream.\n\n2. Speaking of the scrappy superstars: I really got a kick out of Pastrnak letting coach Jim Montgomery know about the little ding-dong he'd planned with his pal Matthew, just for Montgomery to be like, \"yeah, cool, OK.\"\n\n1. You know the old euphemism about an opponent being a \"dance partner\" of sorts? Shoutout to Justin Brazeau and Aleksander Barkov, who took that phrase very, very literally.\n\nSullivan: Bruins and Panthers have become fierce rivals, and the gloves are off\n\nStop the clock just about anywhere in the third period of Wednesday night's playoff game between the Bruins and Panthers and witness the carnage. Bodies tossed with abandon, punches thrown with purpose. Hair flying, tempers flaring and emotions overheating everywhere. The Bruins went to Florida for a hockey game, but ended up in a circus.\n\nIn their 100th year of doing NHL business, the Bruins revisited their romanticized hurly-burly days of yore Wednesday night, trading punches, elbows, facewashes, invectives -- just about everything but shot attempts and scoring chances -- in what was their most lopsided loss of the 2024 postseason, a 6-1 thrashing at the hands of the ornery Panthers.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nJayson Tatum hasn't been lighting it up in the playoffs, but Celtics aren't worried\n\nIf Jaylen Brown's disposition was any indication of the Celtics' mentality entering Game 1 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series, they are taking the Cleveland Cavaliers quite seriously as a formidable opponent. But if the Celtics take care of their business, play with the fortitude and execution they are capable of, this shouldn't be a difficult series.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType":

The Bruins were trying to avoid blowing a 3-1 series lead in the opening round for the second years in a row and earn their first series victory since 2020. The Maple Leafs were trying to avoid their seventh consecutive series loss to the Bruins and figure out how to win a seventh game.\n\nThe tension at TD Garden in the decisive game was palpable and it continued to build deep into a scoreless third period. William Nylander gave the Leafs the edge with his goal at the 9:01 mark of the period. However, instead of sinking the struggling Bruins, defenseman Hampus Lindholm responded quickly with a seeing-eye shot that broke through goalie Ilya Samsonov. Instead of getting beaten on their home ice in the seventh game, the Bruins once again had an opportunity to forge ahead.\n\nThey would win it in overtime on a goal by superstar David Pastrnak, but not before goalie Jeremy Swayman made one more mind-boggling save in the final seconds. A Toronto pass went off the skate of defenseman Parker Wotherspoon and was headed for the back of the net. Swayman saw what was happening and refused to let the puck break the hearts of his teammates and their fans. He covered the puck and the series would be decided in overtime of the final game.\n\nBruins' Pastrnak answers the call from his coach\n\nThe Bruins superstar winger with the heavy shot, speed and creativity had been rather ordinary throughout the series. He had scored two goals, but had been rather quiet in losses in Games 5 and 6. Head coach Jim Montgomery did not hesitate to call out Pastrnak when asked why his team had blown those two games and why they had not put away the Leafs after building a 3-1 series lead.\n\nMontgomery explained that the Bruins needed their \"best players to be their best players\" and that meant Pastrnak had to step up.\n\nThe Czech star did not pout or sulk when he heard his coach mention his name. In fact, he appeared to welcome the challenge. As the seventh game played out, Pastrnak was noticeable on the ice, but through the first 60 minutes, his name was not on the score sheet. That changed at the 1:54 mark of overtime.\n\n\"He's trying to bring the best out of every single player. He expects more,\" Pastrnak said. \"I admitted I needed to be better.\"\n\nAs Lindholm purposefully carried the puck up the ice, Pastrnak picked up speed in the neutral zone. He made eye contact with the defenseman and pointed his stick deep in Toronto ice, silently communicating with his teammate to fire the puck into the corner.\n\nLindholm did just that as he crossed the center-ice red line and the puck rebounded between the circles where Pastrnak made the pickup on his backhand. He quickly shifted the puck to his forehand and then to his backhand before sending it past Samsonov for the the series winner.\n\nBruins triumph sets off celebration\n\nIt set off a frenzy on the ice and in the stands, as the Bruins celebrated wildly and their fans roared their approval.\n\nIt was reminiscent of Boston's 1983 seventh-game overtime victory over the Buffalo Sabres, a triumph earned on Brad Park's slap shot. Nathan Horton famously beat Carey Price of the Montreal Canadiens with a 7th-game OT winner in 2011 and Patrice Bergeron also scored a 7th-game OT winner against the Maple Leafs in 2013.\n\nPastrnak has performed brilliantly for the Bruins throughout his career and a seventh-game overtime winner adds to his legacy. He was clearly one of the heroes of the series and will undoubtedly play a key role in the second round against the Florida Panthers.\n\nMontgomery was on the verge of Bruins fans demanding his firing if the team had lost the series to the Leafs after blowing another 3-1 series lead, as they did last year after a record-setting regular-season run. He appeared powerless to halt that scenario, but when he called out Pastrnak, it was the right move. Montgomery's gamble played out well, as his star player took responsibility for the team and scored the decisive goal.\n\nThose two played key roles for the Bruins, but neither did as much for the Bruins as Swayman. The goalie had a 4-2 record in the series with a 1.50 goals against average and a .950 save percentage. He made huge saves in every game and he did not allow a single shaky goal. He was under severe pressure throughout the series, but he sent a message to his team that he would not be overwhelmed.\n\nIt's the kind of performance that could lead the Bruins to more success throughout the postseason.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_silverman@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Steve Silverman",

Pastrnak, meanwhile, dropped the gloves for only the second fight of his nine-year NHL career.\n\nJim Montgomery was \"proud\" of the superstar goal-scorer for accepting a challenge from Matthew Tkachuk. Marchand unsurprisingly shared the same opinion as his head coach.\n\n\"It's great for him to step up,\" Marchand told reporters after Boston's 6-1 loss, per The Athletic. \"He doesn't fight often. He's actually pretty tough. But you don't want to see a guy like that get hurt. Hopefully he didn't. When guys go down, they can blow out shoulders and hurt hands. Great job by him stepping up. That's what he does.\"\n\nThe latter stage of a lopsided contest was the right time and place for leaders from both teams to engage in fisticuffs.

Tkachuk was the sixth and final Panther to receive a misconduct penalty in the final period (along with six Bruins) after multiple fights left the teams' benches roomy and their locker rooms chatty in the waning moments of the Panthers' 6-1 win in Game 2 of the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs.\n\n\"We were just shooting it, just hanging out,\" Tkachuk said, \"watching a little bit of the game, just talking. There were guys that weren't playing, there were guys that were kicked out. There were a couple trainers in there. It was like the longest third period ever, so we were just hanging out.\"\n\nThe scraps livened up the final period of what turned into a Florida rout, setting the stage for what should be an electric Game 3 at the TD Garden in Boston at 7 p.m. on Friday.\n\n\"It's a little spicy out there,\" Panthers coach Paul Maurice said. \"I think it's awesome.\"\n\nThe first two fights were whole-line brawls, as nearly everyone on the ice found a player on the other team to partner up with or got involved with other players' melees. After Boston's Pat Maroon and Florida's Nick Cousins received misconducts earlier in the period, the fights resulted in eight misconduct penalties: Justin Brazeau,Trent Frederic, Brad Marchand and Charlie McAvoy for the Bruins and Dmitry Kulikov, Eetu Luostarinen, Niko Mikkola and Sam Reinhart for Florida.\n\n\"It was a lot of fun,\" Panthers veteran Kyle Okposo said. \"That one felt like a playoff game. It just is different. There's not many things in this world where you get to do that give you that feeling, that just pure dopamine release in your brain, and playoff hockey is one of them.\"\n\nThen Tkachuk and Pastrnak, the two stars, decided to hash things out on the ice.\n\n\"I think it was just their bottom six guys were doing what they were doing, which I don't think we really liked on our side,\" Tkachuk said. \"I guess they kind of started it there. I don't know, I guess wanted in on the action. I kind of just asked him to fight. He said we'll do it next game. I'm like, maybe we should just do it right now. He's like, 'All right, I'm going out next shift.'\n\n\"(I) give him tons of respect. It was two guys that aren't known for fighting, me and him. Two players who are probably more known for the offensive side of the game. Tons of respect for him. We were both up for the Hart last year, and just to see us out there, battling at center ice in a playoff game, I think it's pretty cool. It's good for hockey. Both emotional guys that are leaders for our teams that really just want to show that we will do whatever it takes to win. We weren't going out there to play patty-cake or anything. We were going out there to have some fun in the fight and try to land some punches, I guess.\"\n\nTkachuk appeared to get the better of the Boston standout, landing a right hook (which cut up Tkachuk's hand, he said Thursday). The two offensive stars are not players who typically drop their gloves, so Tkachuk getting involved fired up the team.\n\n\"Yup, it was awesome,\" Okposo said. \"I love Chucky, and I think when you play against somebody like him for a long time, I don't love him. When he's on your team, he's just such a good person, really good leader and he does things the right way. For him to go out there and do that and Pastrnak to oblige, it just adds a little bit of fire to this series. It was awesome to see. It's just kind of old-school hockey, and that's the way we like it.\n\nNow the two teams travel back to Boston for what has effectively become a best-of-five series, and the Bruins have the home-ice advantage. But the Panthers were in a far worse spot last year, down three games to one, and pulled out a win, so they are not intimidated entering Game 3.\n\n\"If we can hit the repeat button that, we're going to give ourselves the best chance to win the series,\" Okposo said. \"They're obviously going to make adjustments, and coming out in Game 3 at TD Garden is going to be a completely different atmosphere. It's going to be a little bit more challenging to play like that. We know that. The only thing we can take is the blueprint, and we've got to be ready for a different game.\"", "source": {"uri": "sun-sentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SunSentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_lichtenstein@sun-sentinel.com", "name": "Adam Lichtenstein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Maurice", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Maurice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Kulikov_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dmitry Kulikov (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niko_Mikkola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Niko Mikkola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eetu_Luostarinen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eetu Luostarinen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Reinhart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Reinhart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Frederic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trent Frederic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Maroon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Maroon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Okposo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Okposo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_McAvoy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie McAvoy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tfl-l-Bruins-Panthers-Hockey_190256678.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543724", "eventUri": "eng-9543724", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The opportunistic Panthers pounced, beginning with Steven Lorentz's tip in front of the net just 1:56 into the middle frame.\n\nSelke Trophy candidate Aleksander Barkov put Florida ahead for good after beating a stickless Charlie McAvoy to a rebound for his first of two tallies on the evening.\n\nAs the middle frame progressed, the Bruins encountered turnovers, defensive coverage breakdowns, and penalty trouble -- highlighted by yet another too-many-men blunder. Their mistakes all compiled into one when Gustav Forsling blasted his first tally of the playoffs past Jeremy Swayman with under two ticks remaining in the second.\n\nAnother breakdown led to Eetu Luostarinen pouncing on the doorstep to end Swayman's night early in the third.\n\nAmid a sloppy performance, the Bruins showcased some fight in the final 20, highlighted by David Pastrnak's fight with Matthew Tkachuk. But they'll need to channel that energy and produce a bounce-back outing as the series shifts to Boston for Game 3 on Friday night.\n\nHere's what we learned from the Bruins' 6-1 loss in Game 2.\n\nComing off emotional highs in their Game 7 win over Toronto and Game 1 triumph against Florida, the Bruins appeared to have a foundation after cashing in on Coyle's tally during a heavy-hitting opening 20.\n\nInstead, they completely unraveled.\n\nThe Bruins panicked against Florida's aggressive forecheck, beginning with miscommunication on Lorentz's marker. Several minutes later, McAvoy lost his stick en route to Barkov's go-ahead tally.\n\nBoston's shorthanded unit survived a couple of hectic sequences. They killed off the first penalty with Brandon Carlo in the box as McAvoy remained in the room for facial repairs, then overcame their fifth too-many-men penalty of the playoffs.\n\n\"It falls on me in the end,\" Montgomery said. \"We know of the people who's up [in the lineup], and they're making mistakes. So my clarity on who's up is obviously failing our team.\"\n\nThe failures continued after Boston's fifth second too many men infraction of the series. Within a 1:30 span between the second and third frames, the Panthers put things out of reach.\n\nThe Bruins encountered multiple rocky outings over the latter half of the Toronto series. But Swayman's poise and assertiveness kept Boston's hopes alive and eventually provided him with enough offensive support.\n\nAside from Coyle's tally, the Bruins didn't provide any support for their fourth-year netminder.\n\nAmid Boston's sloppy outing, Montgomery gave his workhorse an early breather after yanking Swayman at the 1:28 mark of the third following Lustorainen's marker.\n\n\"I trust that guy with my life,\" Swayman said of Montgomery pulling the plug. \"He's gonna make decisions that is going to help the team. And all I can say is I can't wait for [Game 3] Friday.\"\n\nUllmark, in his first appearance since Game 2 against the Leafs, didn't fare any better. The Swede stopped eight of 10 shots in his 18:32 of spot duty, allowing a power play marker to Barkov and Montour's shorthanded tally.\n\nIt didn't matter who was in net. The Bruins simply didn't have any juice from an execution standpoint. But despite Wednesday's blowout, they wouldn't go away quietly.\n\nWith Game 1 out of reach, the Panthers went into message-sending mode during the final 20.\n\nIn Game 2, they overwhelmed the Bruins physically and mentally. But amid their worst performance of these playoffs, the B's attempted to stand their ground.\n\nFollowing Pat Maroon's game misconduct, the hostilities rose again when Mountour mocked Marchand after his tally at 11:58 of the final frame. In total, the two teams combined for 12 misconducts in the final 20.\n\nBut the most notable tense exchange came a mere 44 seconds after Montour's tally when Pastrnak exchanged in a scrap with Tkachuk.\n\n\"There are two teams that are rivals, you know,\" Montgomery said. \"It's gonna be a series. And what I'm really proud of I'm proud of Pasta, because there's so many guys out there pushing after whistle, and the linesmen are there. Pasta and Tkachuk, they just went out there and let it fly. That's what you like. You like your hockey players to be competitors.\"\n\nThe two combatants discussed their plans for fighting as the officials sorted out the round of misconducts from the Montour exchange with Marchand. Both accepted the bout on the ensuing shift. Pastrnak landed some contact before Tkachuk finished his takedown with a couple of extra blows after the fact.\n\n\"When you're in the game, it's a lot of emotions,\" Pastrnak said of his bout with Tkachuk. \"I'm not afraid of him, to be honest. I can take a punch, and I'd do anything for these guys here.\"\n\nIndeed, Pastrnak and the Bruins took exception to Tkachuk's extra punch. And they also didn't take too kindly to some of the other hostile moments from the ninth playoff matchup with Florida over the last two seasons.\n\nThe heightened emotions will likely carry over into Game 3. But the Bruins need to channel that energy into productivity in order to regain control of the series.", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_rosenthal@boston.com", "name": "Tim Rosenthal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksander_Barkov", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aleksander Barkov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Lorentz", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steven Lorentz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eetu_Luostarinen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eetu Luostarinen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Montour", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Montour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_J._Selke_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frank J.

Michael Dwyer/Associated Press\n\nSports can be the ultimate reality show. We tune in each night to watch our favorite teams, and for the drama.\n\nThere was plenty of the latter in Boston over the weekend.\n\nOn Saturday night, the Bruins rallied to beat the Toronto Maple Leafs in Game 7 of their first-round playoff series.\n\nIt was one of the most nerve-wracking affairs in recent Bruins history. Fans were on the edge of their seats before David Pastrnak scored the winning goal early in overtime.\n\nIt was a storybook finish to Game 7 for Pastrnak, who only a few days earlier was called out by Coach Jim Montgomery.\n\n\"We need more from Pasta,\" said Montgomery after the club dropped Game 6 in Toronto.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a shockingly blunt call to action for the Bruins' top scorer, who struggled in Games 5 and 6.\n\nIt was also a message the forward said he needed to hear.\n\n\"If I'm Coach and you were me, I would say the same thing,\" Pastrnak told the media after the Game 7 victory. \"I had no problem with him saying that. He's trying to bring the best out of every single player. He expects more.\"\n\nHe got more when the Bruins needed it the most. Pastrnak began the game-winning play when he bolted up the ice after dishing the puck to defenseman Hampus Lindholm.\n\nLindholm understood what Pastrnak was doing and delivered a cross-corner dump-in that caromed off the boards and onto Pastrnak's stick. Pastrnak then tucked a backhand shot into the Toronto net to end the drama.\n\nAfter the game, Pastrnak acknowledged there was some relief that came with the goal. After all, the Bruins were just a goal away from blowing a 3-1 series lead for a second consecutive postseason.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCeltics forward Sam Hauserm, left, celebrates with Al Horford after hitting a 3-pointer during Boston's Game 5 victory over Miami on Wednesday in Boston. The Celtics will face the Cavaliers in the second round. Charles Krupa/Associated Press\n\nThe Bruins aren't the only Boston team looking to go deep into the postseason. The Celtics finally return to action Tuesday night when they host the Cavaliers in a second-round series. Boston advanced after beating the Heat in five games.\n\nThe Celtics look well-positioned to roll through the East, although they'll be without center Kristaps Porzingis for a stretch while he heals from a right calf injury. Boston showed it can survive, even thrive, without its big man in the clinching Game 5 victory over Miami on May 1, but things will only get more challenging from here.\n\nPorzingis told the media he is \"expecting to recover at a historic rate\" but admitted the team will have to be cautious. He missed two weeks with a left calf injury earlier this season. As the playoffs progress, a healthy roster becomes all the more pivotal.\n\nThe Celtics have had plenty of time to rest up and prepare for the next round.\n\nIt's a different story for the Bruins, who had just one day off before opening a second-round series in Florida against the Panthers on Monday night. The series is a rematch of last year's first-round matchup, which the Panthers won in seven games. Boston was the top overall seeed last season and had set an NHL record with 135 points in the regular season before losing to Florida.\n\nNow, the Panthers are favored after winning the Atlantic Division and finishing one point ahead of the Bruins.\n\nAs we well know, anything can happen in the playoffs. It's why we watch, and there will be plenty to watch this week as the drama resumes.\n\nTom Caron is a studio host for the Red Sox broadcast on NESN.

And there were buckets of bad blood spilled all Amerant Bank Arena in the third period after the game was decided. In a game in which 146 hits were credited (76-70 in favor of Florida), a total of 148 penalty minutes were dished out, including 11 misconducts in the third period after the game got out of hand.\n\nTwo of those misconducts went to David Pastrnak and Matthew Tkachuk. After they had already devolved into an orgy of message-sending, Tkachuk asked the B's superstar to fight, Pastrnak told coach Jim Montgomery that he was going to accept and the two duked it out in the middle of the ice. Tkachuk got the better of Pastrnak, and even took several late cheap shots.\n\nAsked about the late punches, Pastrnak chose not to comment, chalking up his performance in the fight to his own inexperience. But he did not regret it.\n\n\"You're in a game and it's a lot emotions,\" said Pastrnak. \"I'm not afraid of him, to be honest. I can take a punch and I'd do anything for these guys here.\"\n\nMontgomery gave his alternate captain his kudos.\n\n\"What I'm really proud of, I'm proud of Pasta,\" said Montgomery. \"There are so many guys out there pushing when the linesmen are there. Pasta and Tkachuk just went out there and fought. That's what you like. You like your hockey players to be competitors.\"\n\nAs for the game, Montgomery felt that his team started to feel the effects of their recent workload. The B's started off well and took the first lead in the first period, but they squandered several great scoring chances before Florida got its forechecking game going in the decisive second. When the Panthers scored early in the second, Montgomery decided there was nothing to be gained by leaving Swayman in and he cut his losses.\n\n\"Florida executed better than us today. And last game, we executed. It's a long series. We got the one game we needed to get in Florida and we go back to Boston,\" said Montgomery, adding later, \"We had no juice.\"\n\nIt didn't take long for the Panthers to reveal their strategy, and it looked like it might work. Just 17 second into the first period, Tkachuk took a poke at Swayman, drawing a response from Brandon Carlo and Justin Brazeau. When Tkachuk persisted, Brazeau grabbed him up high and the helmet came off, sending the Bruin to the box.\n\nBut thanks to one great save on Carter Verhaeghe and some more good PK work, they survived it. Then Brad Marchand was tripped at the end of the Florida PP and the B's got an advantage. Marchand missed an open net on a bad angle shot on the PP, but did not miss on a green light hit on Tkachuk, absolutely blasting him on a shorthanded bid.\n\nAfter the B's killed their second penalty - and 25th of 26 in the playoffs - the B's took the first lead of the game at 12:12 when Florida turned over the puck high and their zone and the B's immediately went on the attack. Marchand got a pass through a sliding Niko Mikkola to Pavel Zacha, who in turn tapped it back to Charlie Coyle. Coyle finished off the pretty play, burying his first goal of the playoffs from the left side of the net.\n\nThe B's had chances to take a bigger lead than that in the first. Coyle surprised Sergei Bobrovsky with a long-range shot that beat the goalie but hit the shortside post. And then John Beecher missed a wide-open net when the rebound of a Brazeau shot on a 2-on-1.\n\nSimply put, the B's let the Panthers off the hook, and then Florida found its game in the second.\n\nFlorida tied it up at 1:56 of the second period with a fourth line goal. Parker Wotherspoon's clearing attempt was stopped at the blue line by Brandon Montour. The defenseman flipped the puck toward the net and Steve Lorentz - left alone by Derek Forbort, who appeared to be anticipating a reverse pass by Wotherspoon - deflected it past Swayman to even it up.\n\nThe Panthers' forecheck then gave them their first lead of the game at 9:49. Charlie McAvoy was checked off the puck on a breakout attempt -- and he lost his stick on the play to boot. Florida moved the puck around until Sam Reinhart took a shot that Swayman stopped but couldn't control the rebound. With the stickless McAvoy unable to play the puck, Sasha Barkov tapped home the rebound for the 2-1 lead.\n\nMcAvoy would make a couple of trips to the dressing room after that but returned to finish the period.\n\nAfter a squandered power play and two more kills (including one of the B's fifth too-many-men penalty), it looked like the B's would escape just a one-goal deficit when disaster struck. With 11 seconds left in the period, the B's won a faceoff in their zone and it looked like they'd be heading to the break down a goal.\n\nBut Marchand's bank clear attempt was gloved down by Montour and, with two seconds left in the period, Gustav Forsling blasted a point slap shot past Swayman with a crushing goal.\n\nAnd when Eetu Luostarinen scored at 1:58 of the third off a waved off icing and a turnover, Montgomery had seen enough. He pulled Swayman for Linus Ullmark. It had nothing to do with the goalie's performance.\n\nAsked if Montgomery explained the reasoning, Swayman said, \"Quickly. I trust that guy with my life. He's going to make decisions that are going to help the team and all I can say is I can't wait till Friday.\"\n\nThe rest of the game was a gong show, which led to a Barkov power-play goal after Pat Maroon took a minor and a misconduct in a running tiff with Nick Cousins.\n\nThen Montour scored a shorthanded goal and celebrated in Marchand's face, setting off another round of wrestling matches.\n\nIn the final insult, with both Maroon and Trent Frederic safely tucked away in the dressing room, Tkachuk dropped the gloves with Pastrnak and took three cheap shots with Pastrnak when he was down. Pastrnak then tried to get at Tkachuk through the linesmen.\n\nAsked about the late punches, Montgomery mostly held his tongue, but it was clear he didn't like it.\n\n\"It's not a part of the game for me,\" said Montgomery. \"I'm not going to comment on players from other teams. I just worry about my own players.\"\n\nNo, these two teams don't like each other. And we've got ourselves an old school playoff series.", "source": {"uri": "sentinelsource.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SentinelSource.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Flyers-Penguins. Oilers-Flames.\n\nBut now and then a new one develops solely out of the hatred two teams have for each other, and we, the hockey-watching public, reap the benefits.\n\nThe fresh-baked rivalry between the Florida Panthers and Boston Bruins is exactly that.\n\nI think we all had a sense that there would be no love lost between the two sides after the Panthers came back from a 3-1 series deficit to bounce the Bruins in the first round after a historically dominant run through the regular season.\n\nThe Bruins took Game 1 in pretty dominant fashion while the Panthers smoked them in Game 2 by a score of 6-1, but it's the rough stuff that came on Wednesday night that lets you know that this is a bonafide playoff rivalry in the same vein as those brutal Avalanche-Red Wings series in the mid to late '90s.\n\nI mean, we had a full-blown line brawl after a goal. This is some serious old-time hockey we're talking about.\n\nFlorida's Brandon Montour scored the sixth and final goal for the Panthers with just over eight minutes to play, and he celebrated by screaming in Brad Marchand's face just like his old teammate Radko Gudas did last year to Toronto Maple Leaf's netminder Joseph Woll.\n\nMarchand didn't love it, and before you knew, there was a yard sale's worth of gloves, buckets, and twigs littering the ice.\n\nCurious about what Marchand saw in that moment? I've got you, pal.\n\nYeah... that would start a line brawl in a beer league game, let alone a Stanley Cup Playoffs blowout.\n\nOh, and here's the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance as they say: after linesmen got in to separate the two, Montour pretended to lick Marchand.\n\nDamn, what a callback...\n\nThe rough stuff wasn't done after that. Just about a minute later Matthew Tkachuk threw hands with... wait this can't be right...\n\nAfter that line brawl, you could tell tensions were still high because Tkachuk and Pastrnak started getting chippy with each other while they were waiting to get explanations from the officials.\n\nAfter that, Pastrnak went back to the bench and appeared to ask his B's head coach Jim Montgomery if he was cleared to trade knuckle sandwiches with Tkahuck. I don't think I've ever seen that, but as you're about to see Pasta doesn't do a ton of fighting, so maybe he wasn't aware that that wasn't necessary.\n\nAnyway, Monty approved, and when Pastrnak hopped the boards for his next shift, I think his mitts hit the ice before his skate blades did. He squared up with the man they call \"The Rat King\" and then...\n\n...was soundly beaten.\n\nStill, this was one of the more intense fights you'll see. It wasn't pretty, but it was real. It wasn't one of those fights where a guy tapped someone on the shins and was like, \"I need one,\" and the other guy obliged.\n\nNope. This was a real fight.\n\nAnd while Tkachuk more or less fed Pastrnak his lunch, it doesn't matter. The mere fact that he was willing to drop the mitts will juice up the Bruins going into Game 3, and I wouldn't be surprised if we look back at that moment as a turning point in the series.\n\nIf Game 3 isn't appointment viewing for you after this... we probably can't be friends.\n\nThe fireworks are far from over, and I wouldn't be stunned if this becomes a heated rivalry for years to come.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_reigle@outkick.com", "name": "Matt Reigle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_rivalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "College rivalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_in_ice_hockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fighting in ice hockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Woll", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Woll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radko_Gudas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radko Gudas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Montour", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Montour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowout_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blowout (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montour_County,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montour County, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montour County, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rat_King", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Rat King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_skating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ice skating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sandwich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasta", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pasta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/05/panthers-bruins-rivalry.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543724", "eventUri": "eng-9543724", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Tkachuk drops Pastranak as Panthers-Bruins series gets fierce", "body": "SUNRISE -- Matthew Tkachuk leaned over the sideboards from the Florida Panthers bench and asked Boston Bruins star David Pastrnak to fight, the way you might ask a schoolmate to come out and play.\n\nPastranak turned to his coach for permission, because there's a protocol for the team's top scorer to follow. He then nodded back to Tkachuk.\n\nIt was Panthers 6, Bruins 1 on the conversational undercard to Game 2 on Wednesday night as their playoff series evened at 1-1.\n\nTkachuk dropped Pastranak on the talk marquee.\n\nTheir fight highlighted a game that devolved into dropped gloves, was Exhibit A in how their fierce rivaly is lit entering Friday's Game 3 in Boston and was something you can watch, \"over and over and over again,'' as Panthers coach Paul Maurice said.\n\nEasy for him to say. Tkachuk walloped Pastranak\n\n\"I think it's a good thing,'' Maurice said. \"You have two elite offensive players. (Tkachuk) is a 100-point guy all day long. Pastrnak's just this brilliant player. It's the playoffs. They each have their team. They got their brothers in their room. It's a little spicy out there. I think it's awesome.\"\n\nHe then added, \"Sorry if that offends you, but I think it's awesome.\"\n\nWhat all this awesomeness means to Game 3 and the larger series is harder to nail down. First, the fight. The question for Pastranak afterward was how Tkachuck's right fist tastes. It was that one-sided, just as expected considering Pastranak had one previous NHL fight back in 2018 and Tkachuk considers one fight a good shift.\n\nBut the hockey code that was the river running through Game 2's final minutes of fisticuffs meant both sides applauded their guy. Pastranak went out and represented his team in a way that drew respect.\n\n\"Yeah, definitely for the team,'' Pastranak said. \"(Tkachuk) was asking me so I felt like (I needed to) step up. The game was over, 6-1, so give it a go. He got what he wanted and we're off to Game 3.\"\n\nThe Panthers, like Boston, have no problem going down in the gutter, if that's what a night asks. Game 2 asked it, too. Down 5-1, Boston turned to pushing, shoving, mauling in a way the Panthers understand. Nine players were ejected in 17 third-period penalties. It was something out of the '70s. The penalty minutes were the most in a Panthers playoff game and most for Boston since 1988.\n\nBrandon Montour scored the final goal, was grabbed by Boston captain Brad Marchand and gave a loud, \"Woooo!\" in Marchand's face. They fought. The Panthers' Niko Mikkola bodyslammed Boston's Charlie McAvoy to the ice. The Panthers' Dmitri Kulikov threw Boston's Justin Brazeau down on the goal netting.\n\nMaybe a ringside judge needs to speak up, but the Panthers seemed to have their way in the fights that went beyond grabbing and pushing. None looked worse than Tkachuk vs. Pastranak.\n\n\"Stick and move,\" might be a lesson for Pastranak the next time Tkachuk comes calling. (Tkachuk was not available to the media afterward in the manner all Boston players were).\n\n\"I'm not afraid of him, to be honest,'' Pastranak said. \"I can take a punch and I'd do anything for these guys here.\"\n\nAnd what does it all mean to the series? Nothing more than the playoff intensity is on high now. Boston didn't lose because it fought. It fought because it lost.\n\nThe fights were a statement of hockey code and sending messages. Nothing more. And carryover emotions in the series?\n\n\"It doesn't have emotions -- everything stops, the emotion stops,\" said Marchand, one of the league's best instigators who, like Tkachuk is also a complete player. \"Being upset about it all stops. It's just about getting back to X's and O's, finding out where we can get better.\n\n\"You know the emotion will create itself throughout the game. No trying to force it, it'll happen naturally.\"\n\nThe Panthers won Game 2 because Aleksander Barkov had two goals, two assists, a team-high nine hits, won eight of 11 face-offs and dominated as best any single player can. They won because their fourth line rode over Boston's lower lines. Steven Lorentz tipping in a shot to tie the game, 1-1, and they wore out Boston's fourth line to the point Barkov came on and scored his first goal on a reboun to make it 2-1.\n\nThe Panthers won because their defense held strong to the point goalie Sergei Bobrovsky faced just 15 shots. The Panthers had 35 shots and sent Boston goalie Jeremy Swayman to the bench in the midst of his stellar playoff run.\n\nYou understand why Maurice said of the headlined fight, \"It was awesome?\"\n\nIt capped a night of awesome for the Panthers. Boston got the split it wanted in these opening games. But the Panthers were back to playing like the Panthers after an uncharacteristic Game 1. Now the series goes to Boston and the only question again is who's looks awesome with the gloves on.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Maurice", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paul Maurice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Kulikov_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dmitry Kulikov (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niko_Mikkola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Niko Mikkola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Montour", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Montour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_McAvoy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie McAvoy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Lorentz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steven Lorentz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksander_Barkov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aleksander Barkov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Bobrovsky", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Bobrovsky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Face-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7vnYTJYI.Tic0VIhT3O9WQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/south_florida_sun_sentinel_local_714/92fb3bcdb9831effb7fa07f3b1306708", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543724", "eventUri": "eng-9543724", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

So, I had no problem with him saying that,\" said Pastrnak. \"He's trying to bring the best out of every single player and he expects more. I just took it and tried to be better.

And as soon as I know he's in that frame of mind, I knew he was going to be good tonight.\"\n\nPastrnak said while there is still room for growth, both individually and as a team, he thought the Black & Gold's mindset ahead of Game 7 was a vast improvement.\n\n\"Me and March had a talk, we did feel great going in, we are at home,\" said Pastrnak. \"The whole morning, great pregame skate and, overall, the group sticking together was a big part of it.

However, this time it was not the Boston Bruins in the driver's seat. The Florida Panthers took the Game 1 loss personally and came out with a vengeance. You saw the more dominant version of the Panthers, who defeated the Bruins 6-1.\n\nIt was an ugly game for the Bruins all around, as they did not have their best effort. The tone was set for Game 3, as it turned into a physical affair. Here are three key takeaways from the lopsided loss.\n\nFlorida Dominant at Five-on-Five\n\nDuring the 2023-24 regular season, the Panthers were the best defensive team at five-on-five play. They allowed the second fewest shot attempts and allowed the fewest goals. It is what made them successful and they put that on full display in Game 2.\n\nRelated: Jeremy Swayman's Playoff Performance Mimicking Former Bruin Tim Thomas\n\nThis was a much different Panthers team that showed up in Game 1. They were not bad but you could see the long rest had them feeling rusty. It took one game to get it into gear and the Panthers were their normal dominant selves. So dominant that they did not give the Bruins any room to breathe and generate any offense.\n\nBy the midway point of the third period, the Bruins went 15 minutes without a shot on net. That's a testament to how good the Panthers' defense was in terms of suppressing the Bruins' chances. Over the course of the game, the Panthers held the Bruins to 26 shot attempts and 11 shots on goal during five-on-five play. Furthermore, the Panthers held the Bruins to 16 shots on goal. It was not just the quantity of the shots that the Panthers didn't allow, but the quality as well.\n\nIn all situations, the Panthers allowed only nine high-danger shot attempts, and five made it on goal. With the limited offense they were able to generate, the Bruins finished the game with a subpar 2.34 expected goals for. The Panthers showed how dominant they could be and even made the Bruins pay with the man advantage.\n\nBruins Being Undisciplined Costs Them\n\nIf there was any takeaway from the third period of Game 2, it was that the tone was set for Game 3 in Boston on Friday night (May 10). It got physical and you saw many guys get ejected from the game. In fact, in a span of 2:23, there was a combined 114 penalty minutes. The officials decided to play it safe and have the guys leave the game before things got way out of hand. You even saw a superstar scrap between David Pastrnak and Matthew Tkachuk. It was a great display of leadership by Pastrnak, who had his first fight since 2018 against a guy in Tkachuk who is not afraid to drop the gloves.\n\nFor the Bruins, being undisciplined goes beyond the scrums and scraps. Over the course of the game, the Bruins handed the Panthers six power play opportunities. The penalty kill has been sensational, having a 95.8% success rate up until this point but eventually, the luck will run out.\n\nThe Panthers sustained good pressure and fired 21 shot attempts toward the net, of which eight made it on goal. It was never just the quantity, but the quality, and the Panthers finished the game with 1.82 expected goals with the man advantage. They ultimately capitalized, as they went one for six in the game, thanks to captain Aleksander Barkov. The Bruins' penalty kill has been good, but giving the Panthers any form of life with the man advantage is a recipe for disaster. Not to mention, Sam Reinhart, who had 27 power play goals in the regular season, is the last player the Bruins need to get into a groove when down a man. No matter the opponent, if you give them chances they will capitalize.\n\nSwayman Human for the First Time These Playoffs\n\nThis was the toughest start for Bruins goaltender Jeremy Swayman. Up until this point, he had never allowed more than two goals in a single start. In Game 2 against the Panthers, he finished the game with four goals against and got pulled in the third period. Granted, the team in front of him did him no favors and got completely dominated by the relentless Panthers pressure.\n\nSwayman stopped 19 of the 23 shots he faced, which saw him finish with a .826 save percentage. Furthermore, he had a subpar minus-0.46 goals saved above expected and surrendered three goals in the high-danger area of the ice.\n\nLinus Ullmark came in to relieve him and also surrendered two goals. The Bruins allowed 12 goals in the seven games of Round 1 against the Toronto Maple Leafs and in this game met the halfway point at six. Swayman has been the story of the playoffs, as he has been playing at a Conn Smythe level. However, last night was the most human he's looked all postseason but he isn't the first goalie these playoffs to have an off night.\n\nRegroup for Game 3 and Shake This Loss Off\n\nTwo games down and a lopsided win for each club. It was never going to be easy, especially against the Panthers. The Bruins were able to steal a game down in Sunrise, but got to see the real Panthers in Game 2.\n\nGame 3's tone has officially been set in what should still be a physical series. Going forward, the Bruins will want to stay more disciplined and not give the Panthers any extra chances. Also, they'll want to follow the Game 1 recipe and continue to test Sergei Bobrovsky and get through the pesky Panthers' defense. We have a series on our hands, so get the popcorn ready.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tommy_bennett@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Tommy Bennett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_on_goal_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shot on goal (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Thomas_(ice_hockey,_born_1974)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Thomas (ice hockey, born 1974)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-handed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Short-handed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksander_Barkov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aleksander Barkov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Reinhart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Reinhart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Bobrovsky", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Bobrovsky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conn_Smythe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conn Smythe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Ullmark", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linus Ullmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Panthers-Celebrate-2-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543724", "eventUri": "eng-9543724", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 2167, "textEnd": 2173}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

But before Pastrnak dropped the gloves amid a blowout, six (!) Bruins were sent to the dressing room for 10-minute misconducts.\n\nOne of those players was Brad Marchand, who went after Brandon Montour following the Florida defenseman's third-period shorthanded goal. The charge sparked a mosh pit, which saw virtually every skater on the ice find a dance partner while the referees tried to subdue the situation.\n\nMarchand after the game revealed how Montour drew his ire.

There is little doubt that that the skating is faster, the moves are more complex, the shooting is more accurate and the skill level is at a brilliantly high level, but the lack of fighting and brawling has this omnipresent minority group longing for the bench-clearing brawls of yesteryear.\n\nThat not-so-silent minority got just what they wanted in the third period of Florida's Game 2 victory over the Boston Bruins, a 6-1 triumph that evened their best-of-seven series at 1-1. The Bruins trailed 2-1 late in the second period when Panthers defenseman Gustav Forsling blasted the puck by screened goalie Jeremy Swayman with two seconds remaining. They followed that with another goal less that two minutes into the third period, ending the competitive portion of the game.\n\nAfter that, the contest disintegrated into a series of fights and gross misconduct penalties that saw both teams with depleted benches shortly after the middle of the third period. The \"highlight\" was a fight between agitator supreme Matthew Tkachuk of the Panthers and superstar David Pastrnak of the Bruins with slightly more than seven minutes to play. For those that keep score of these dust ups, Tkachuk landed a couple of haymakers, but Pastrnak got in a couple of his own late right hands as officials tried to separate them.\n\nThe Bruins were eliminated from the playoffs a year ago by the Panthers after a record-setting season, and they are not about to let that team push them around. \"I mean, this is what playoff hockey is all about,\" Bruins captain Brad Marchand said. \"The rivalries are built and obviously with last year you know it kind of started there. They play a physical game and we're able to do that as well. So it creates a lot of emotion and adrenaline.\"\n\nThe Bruins were once know as \"Big and Bad,\" as they used to swagger through the league with a group of talented stars who enjoyed the fisticuffs nearly as much as they enjoyed putting the puck in the net. Bobby Orr is still recognized by many as the greatest player the game has ever known, and he was also a player who could fight his own battles with remarkable success. Today's Bruins remain one of the league's tougher teams.\n\nBut it was the Panthers who dictated in Game 2 after a poor showing in the series opener. After falling behind 1-0 after the first period, the Panthers relieved the pressure when Stephen Lorentz, Aleksander Barkov and Forsling found the back of the net in the second period. Florida would add three more goals in the third, and it will be up to the Bruins to respond when the series moves to Boston for Game 3 Friday night.\n\nThe equalizing victory by the Panthers in Game 2 means the series has begun in earnest. The Carolina Hurricanes will have to win Game 3 at home Thursday night if they want that to happen in their Eastern Conference series.\n\nThe New York Rangers won the first two games at home and bring a 2-0 advantage into Raleigh, N.C. Both victories came by 4-3 margins, but the Game 2 loss came in double overtime when Vincent Trocheck fired the puck past Carolina goalie Frederik Andersen, sending Madison Square Garden into a frenzy of celebration.\n\nThe most prominent reason for New York's 2-0 advantage is the Rangers' success on the power play. The Rangers have connected on four of nine man-advantage opportunities, while the Hurricanes have failed in all five of their chances.\n\nThis is a shocking development based on what happened in the regular season because the Hurricanes were the best penalty-killing team in the NHL (86.4 percent success rate) and had the second-best power play percentage (26.9).\n\nThe Panthers have to reverse this trend in Game 3 if they want to get back in a series that many viewed as an even matchup. \"The PK has got to kill and the power play has got to convert on just probably one (attempt) and we'd find a way to win,\" Hurricanes captain Jordan Staal said. \"I thought our five-on-five game was great. Everyone in the room knows our special teams have got to be better.\"\n\nThe Presidents' Trophy-winning Rangers are 6-0 in the postseason and look like the NHL's best team to this point in the post season.\n\nRangers fans are holding their breath, hoping that this is real and will continue well into June. The echoes of their last championship in 1994 are quite distant, and they are hungry for another parade down the Canyon of Heroes.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bench-clearing_brawl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bench-clearing brawl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoff_format", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoff format"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Forsling", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gustav Forsling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Hurricanes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Hurricanes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Orr", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bobby Orr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Rangers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Rangers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksander_Barkov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aleksander Barkov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederik_Andersen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frederik Andersen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Trocheck", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vincent Trocheck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Staal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Staal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raleigh, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Raleigh, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/663cedae1d085cd0cdaa9e3b/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543724", "eventUri": "eng-9543724", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

The pair became friends instantly and still share a close bond as their NHL careers continue to grow.\n\nIt was unfortunate for Nylander that it was his best friend that knocked him and the Maple Leafs out of the playoffs, and the close embrace Pastrnak gave the 28-year-old might have been his way to try to console the Toronto star.\n\nWhile Nylander and the Maple Leafs wonder what's next, Pastrnak and the Bruins continue their path to a Stanley Cup after taking a 1-0 series lead over the Florida Panthers in the second round Monday.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_ounpraseuth@nesn.com", "name": "Jason Ounpraseuth", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nylander", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "William Nylander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Domi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Domi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleacher_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bleacher Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Bertuzzi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Bertuzzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Sweeteners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Sweeteners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Rave", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Rave", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://nesn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/05/david_pastrnak.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543724", "eventUri": "eng-9543724", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

This is where rivalries are built,\" Brad Marchand said. \"With last year, it kind of started there. They play a physical game. It creates a lot of emotion and adrenaline, a lot of really good battles. You can see both teams want to win and they're leaving it all out there.\"\n\nEverybody wearing a letter on their jersey for the Bruins finished the night early as Marchand, the Bruins captain and alternate captains Charlie McAvoy and David Pastrnak each got misconducts.\n\nPastrnak also got a major penalty for fighting Panthers pest Matthew Tkachuk.\n\n\"What I'm really proud of is Pasta. There are so many guys out there pushing after the whistles when the linesmen is going to be there,\" he said. \"They just went out there and fought. That's what you like. You like your hockey players to be competitors.\"\n\nFor Boston, it started with Pat Maroon. The Bruins traded for the veteran forward for his playoff experience and to be a presence when things got nasty in the playoffs. Fulfilling the second half of that role got Maroon an early exit in Game 2.\n\nWith the Bruins unlikely to dig out of a three-goal hole, Maroon went after Nick Cousins, who dethroned Marchand as the NHL's most hated player in an Athletic poll. Both players were given misconducts, that for all practical purposes ended their nights as the game was unlikely to go to overtime. Florida led 3-1 after the second and kept building their edge after that.\n\n\"I don't think it will spill over to the next game. These are two teams that are rivals,\" Montgomery said. \"Playing each other last year and playing each other this year, it's going to be a series.\"\n\nMarchand thought the makeup of the Bruins roster makes them more able to stand their ground.\n\n\"We're built a little different this year.

I don't. He's lucky he didn't get his head kicked him, frankly. So now, look, can someone else do it? I'd prefer it. I sort of abide by the older hockey rules in that, like, the skilled guys stay out of the way and let the fighters fight It bugged me a little that a lot of this went down after Maroon was gone. So I sort of look at that and at Florida and go, is that a coincidence? But I will say this, I don't want Pastrnak fighting. I don't. And I understand the emotional part of it and all that, but he's going to get his head kicked him. He looks like completely lost with the idea of no gloves on and no helmet on. Like, here I go. And I will tell you that in one sense, you know, did I sort of say I give him credit for having the balls. And I do, but I think if it comes to that, they're going to get freaking planted..\n\nFelger: I don't blame Pastrnak. I don't. And I want to give him credit. I really do. And even if he's wrong, quote unquote \"wrong\" to want to do it, I still would rather him ere on that side of it, making a statement, answering the bell, you know, whatever cliche you want to throw at it, getting his teammates back, what, what blah blah blah. You know, like all that. I'm into it. I want to give him credit for thinking that way and doing that. Should he be allowed to do it? I mean, it's a joke for him to fight Matthew Tkachuk. That's a joke. It's not a fair fight. It's not. That's not how those fights go. You square off with someone in your class. So he should have been chirping like Reinhart or Tarasenko or one of their softest players. And that's who he should have been tapping on the shoulder. He had Reinhart behind the net in theMontour and Marchand scrum. The shorthanded scrum. He had Reinhart behind the net. He and Reinhart were going at it. That's feels like your guy, Reinhart scored what, 57 goals this year? So that's your guy. Matthew Tkachuck? What are you, stupid? Now again, I don't blame him for being stupid.

In this piece, let's look at Matthew Tkachuk's net worth in 2024.\n\nMatthew Tkachuk's net worth in 2024 is $60 million. Tkachuk is a popular professional ice hockey player who currently suits up for the Florida Panthers of the NHL and is part of a famous hockey family. He is the son of NHL legend Keith Tkachuk and already a two-time NHL All-Star. Let's take a closer look at Matthew Tkachuk's net worth in 2024.\n\nMatthew Tkachuk's net worth in 2024 is $60 million. This is according to reputable outlets such as Sportskeeda.\n\nMatthew Tkachuk's early life\n\nMatthew Tkachuk was born on Dec. 11, 1997, in Scottsdale, Ariz. He studied at Chaminade College Preparatory School. After ninth grade, Tkachuk decided that he'd embark on a hockey career by joining the United States Hockey League. In 2010, Tkachuk also played in the International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament.\n\nGiven Tkachuk's obvious talent, it wasn't a surprise he was called up to represent Team USA in the World Hockey Challenge. He played for the Under-17, Under-18 and Under-20 teams in 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.\n\nTkachuk helped the United States take the gold medal in both the 2015 World Hockey Challenge in Switzerland and in 2016 when he represented the Under-20 squad in Finland.\n\nAfter showcasing his wares on the international stage, Tkachuk joined OHL after he forfeited his NCAA eligibility by declaring for the 2013 OHL (Ontario Hockey League) Priority Selection. In the draft, he was selected in the fourth round by the London Knights.\n\nEventually, Tkachuk signed his first professional deal with the London Knights. However, details of the deal were undisclosed. Tkachuk would go on to help the Knights win the Memorial Cup Championship.\n\nMatthew Tkachuk's first NHL contracts\n\nIn 2016, after wrapping up his stint with the Knights, Tkachuk declared for the NHL Draft, where he was selected sixth overall pick by the Calgary Flames. He signed a rookie deal with the Flames worth $5.3 million over three years, according to Spotrac.\n\nTkachuk played 76 games in his rookie year, accumulating 48 points to finish seventh in the running for the Calder Memorial Trophy, annually awarded to the NHL's top rookie.\n\nAfter a stellar debut season, Tkachuk continued to solidify himself in the NHL, scoring 49 and 77 points his next two seasons. Tkachuk became one of the youngest players in Flames history to reach 100 total points.\n\nJust before the 2019-2020 season started, Tkachuk was in the midst of contract negotiations, prompting him to miss training camp. Fortunately, Tkachuk and the Flames agreed to a lucrative three-year contract extension that would pay him $21 million.\n\nMatthew Tkachuk's trade to Panthers, blockbuster contract\n\nThis contract extension would keep Tkachuk in Calgary for three more seasons. However, given he had no intention of signing a long-term contract with the Flames, the team decided to trade Tkachuk to the Panthers in a blockbuster deal that sent Jonathan Huberdeau, MacKenzie Weegar, Cole Schwindt and a first-round draft pick back to Calgary.\n\nJust shortly after, the Panthers quickly signed Tkachuk to a massive eight-year deal worth $76 million. In a Panthers uniform, Tkachuk has thrived to become the franchise player. In fact, there's also a case to be made for Tkachuk to become the face of the NHL.\n\nTkachuk has already garnered an All-Star appearance with Florida, and more importantly, led the team past the Carolina Hurricanes to clinch a spot in the 2023 Stanley Cup Final.\n\nMatthew Tkachuk leads Panthers to 2023 Stanley Cup Finals\n\nBut more importantly, he played an instrumental role in helping the team put away the Carolina Hurricanes in the Eastern Conference finals to clinch a spot in the 2023 Stanley Cup Finals. In the Eastern Conference Finals series, Tkachuk made waves after hitting a string of game winners.\n\nIn response to the Panthers playing for the Stanley Cup, Tkachuk reflected on his journey from the Flames to the Panthers.\n\n\"It's been crazy. It's been a great change lifestyle-wise and living-wise. I so enjoyed my time in Calgary, and we obviously had a great group of guys up there. So many great memories. But coming down here, it's really been truly amazing,\" he told Mike Zeisberger of NHL.com.\n\n\"I wouldn't say I'm truly surprised about that or how it's been on the ice, but it's just been such a great fit. I knew it was going to be great, but I didn't think it was going to be as great as it is now. It's been awesome. Just being on a new team. Helping to grow the game here. A new team, a new environment, a great city to live and play in. It's all been awesome.\"\n\nUnfortunately, the Panthers fell to the Las Vegas Golden Knights in five games. Tkachuk did have a memorable late third-period game-tying goal in Game 3, which the Panthers won in overtime.\n\nIn 2024, the Panthers are back in the playoffs as the Atlantic Division champions and knocked out the Tampa Bay Lightning in the first round in five games. Tkachuk had three goals and six assists in the series. The Panthers will now take on the Boston Bruins in the second round.\n\nNevertheless, were you at all stunned by Matthew Tkachuk's net worth in 2024?", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com",

Revisiting the goal that ended the Maple Leafs' 2034-24 season", "body": "\"We get their best player flying through the neutral zone and we don't pick him up,\" Leafs coach Sheldon Keefe said.\n\nThe last play of the Maple Leafs' season started with four Toronto players in the neutral zone: John Tavares and William Nylander near the centre of the ice. Morgan Rielly and Ilya Lyubushkin along the blue line.\n\nMitch Marner had just stepped on the ice when the Bruins' Hampus Lindholm started the play that would take four seconds to execute.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe Leafs don't know it, but the Bruins had called an audible, a set play. David Pastrnak circled near his blue line, and picked up speed on the right side of the boards, near Marner. Lindholm moved toward centre ice and Tavares moved toward him.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIt looked like it might be a harmless dump of the puck to the left of Leafs goaltender Ilya Samsonov, who was only playing because Joseph Woll was injured.\n\nTavares attacked Lindholm, but the Bruins defenceman shot the puck into the corner one minute and 50 seconds into overtime. Marner was watching the play to his left, not Pastrnak to his right. He probably should have at least gotten in Pastrnak's way at the blue line but it was too late do to anything.\n\n\"We get their best player flying through the neutral zone and we don't pick him up coming through,\" Leafs coach Sheldon Keefe said.\n\nLyubushkin and Nylander were positioned well enough to stop other Bruins but they didn't come. Two Boston players went off on a line change.\n\nSamsonov had a choice: Attack the aggressive dump-in to get control of the puck or stay in his net.\n\n\"I think my decision was good, not going,\" he said. \"I was watching this moment 20 times, maybe more. But, still, I think I made the right decision.\"\n\nIt wasn't just a dump-in, though. It was a pass off the back boards -- the hometown boards the Bruins know better than the Leafs.\n\nRielly turned to chase the puck as soon as Lindholm shot it, but it was too late. Pastrnak was already there. The Bruins star picked up the puck, and crossed from Samsonov's left to his right, with Rielly flailing at him unsuccessfully. It was a moment Rielly has relived \"a lot.\"\n\n\"It's hard to describe, you know,\" he said. \"I don't know if I can.\"\n\nPastrnak carried the puck across the crease and Samsonov was unable to spread-eagle in the same way the rubbery Woll can. Pastrnak found the smallest of holes between the goalpost and Samsonov's right skate to tuck the puck in for the win at 1:54 of overtime.\n\n\"It's difficult,\" Tavares said. \"You wake up and you're so used to seeing the schedule, getting ready to go to the rink, compete, have the opportunity to continue the journey and work toward obviously the ultimate goal.\n\n\"The realization that it's over, it's very difficult to accept and hard to deal with.\"", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_mcgran@thestar.com", "name": "Kevin McGran", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Rielly", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Rielly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nylander", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "William Nylander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Keefe", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheldon Keefe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_Lindholm", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elias Lindholm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Lyubushkin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Lyubushkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Marner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Marner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tavares", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Tavares"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Samsonov", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Samsonov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampus_Lindholm", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hampus Lindholm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Woll", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Woll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/a4/7a405ab0-afb1-57d1-b429-13453436bbde/663950478fa49.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543724", "eventUri": "eng-9543724", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 101, "relevance": 1}

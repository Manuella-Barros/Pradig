Picnics on the grass and singalongs in the park kicked off Taylor\u2019s much anticipated Saturday night gig after she impressed with an unforgettable experience on Friday. TikTok videos aplenty show night one\u2019s most memorable moments - including Taylor saying she regretted not coming to Edinburgh sooner, helping out some fans in distress over the microphone and spotting a wedding proposal in the audience - and over 70,000 more Swifties are putting their glad rags and friendship bracelets on for a belter of a weekend. On night two, some heeded advice that it was colder than expected inside the stadium by layering up over their sequins - but there were still some impressive outfits on show from lots of Eras including 1989, Reputation, Folklore, Red and more. Local shops offered Taylor Swift cookies and cocktails, while feather boas , cowboy hats and sparkly T-shirts were on sale around the stadium. Queues appeared early with around 200 people arriving well before the 8:30am mark to try and ensure a good spot in the standing areas. Amongst them were Siobhan \u2018Gina\u2019 Taberna, and Morag \u2018Sarah\u2019 Bennett, from Bradford who met Jason Farrow, and Simon Metcalf from Birmingham in the queue and became new besties. Jason, who was wearing a jacket with lyrics from Taylor\u2019s latest album, and song Fortnight, said: \u201dWe are colossal born again Swifties. I brought my husband here kicking and screaming as you can see on his T-shirt.\u201d The girls who were dressed in 1989 and Reputation inspired costumes couldn\u2019t wait to see Taylor. Morag said: \u201cEverything is brilliant about Taylor. She empowers women and men to be who they are.\u201d Standing on the grass in front of the huge stadium, which is welcoming around 200,000 fans over the weekend, were Jemma Chipchase, 38, and her daughter Faith, 19 from Consett in County Durham, who have been Taylor fans from day one. Faith, in her red bra top and handmade Reputation inspired skirt, said: \u201cTaylor is an absolute icon and her concerts are just perfect. We are hoping she announces 'Reputation: Taylor\u2019s version' because today's Kanye West\u2019s birthday and are looking forward to the end Tortured Poets Department. Jenna, who wore a T-shirt proclaiming \u2018It\u2019s me. I\u2019m the Swiftie ma. It\u2019s me\u2019, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not been too expensive for us. We bought the tickets last year and are staying in a hostel which is an absolute bargain. We\u2019ve stayed here two nights and are making the most of it. We\u2019ve seen her in London and Manchester before and wish she\u2019d come to Newcastle.\u201d Their friends Lily Gailes, 17, and her mum Laura Thompson, 40 - also from Consett in County Durham - were inspired to dress in glittering outfits reflecting Mirrorball from the Folklore Era. Lily said: \u201cI\u2019ve been a fan of Taylor for quite a while and made my mum a playlist as soon as the album came out and tickets went on sale.\u201d Laura said: \u201cNow I\u2019m her biggest fan and we can\u2019t wait to see the surprise songs this evening. I love Out The Woods.\u201d Both ladies had a message for Taylor as they shouted: \u201cWe love you.\u201d The star, who herself has 16 outfit changes throughout the show, has always encouraged her fans to enjoy the whole experience of her gigs, from the giant projector screens and dancers, to incredible backing singers and pyrotechnics which match the catchy lyrics of her hit songs. Jumarie Agbayani, 25, from the Philippines couldn't wait to take part in the celebrations. As a massive Swiftie who listens to her music when he\u2019s not working in a care home, he said: \u201cMy favourite song is Betty from Folklore. The concert looked incredible last night and I love the connection and the way she brings everyone together. I\u2019ve been a fan since 2013.\u201d Destiny Mock, 24, came all the way from Pittsburgh to enjoy the gig. She looked incredible in a green dress and cape inspired by Folklore. She said: \u201cMy outfit was inspired by Folkore with the cape but the dress is also from Debut Era with all the butterflies and I\u2019ve got 60 friendship bracelets and not swapped any yet. I couldn\u2019t get any tickets in the US and I\u2019d never been of Europe so I\u2019m using it as an excuse to travel around Europe.\u201d She added: \u201cI\u2019m hoping that she plays my favourite surprise song off the Tortured Poets Department.\u201d Destiny said Taylor is amazing because: \u201cShe really cares about her fans and she just makes it an experience, not just a concert.\u201d Julie Anne, 16, from Edinburgh and her friend Marrie, 13, from Canterbury even brought her Swiftie dogs Lexie and Dougie to Murrayfield for a quick walk. Julie Anne said: \u201cDougie is a big Reputation fans and Lexie prefers Speak Now or Enchanted Bejewelled cause everyone stares at her when you walk in a room. Unfortunately they can\u2019t come to the gig but we are going. We are hoping for Forever and Always as the surprise song.\u201d And making the most of all the sideshows which accompany Taylor Swift on tour was Jack Page, 30 from Norwich, a graphic designer who looked resplendent in his sequinned jacket and matching eye make-up from the Reputation album.

It\u2019s very addictive. My favourite song is Don't Blame Me.\u201d Jack, who also said he was heading to London to see Swiftie after his holiday in Scotland, added: \u201cWe came to Scotland for the first time a few days ago and flew up from Norwich. We are spending the week here. We went to the zoo yesterday and it\u2019s very nice.

{"id": 243231682, "title": "How a Trump-Beating, #MeToo Legal Legend Lost Her Firm", "text": "Last fall, senior partners at Kaplan Hecker & Fink, a New York law firm known for championing liberal causes, made a fateful decision: They were going to sideline their hard-charging and crusading founder, Roberta A. Kaplan. The reign of one of the country\u2019s most prominent lawyers was coming to an end. Ms. Kaplan was already famous when she founded her law firm in 2017, having won a landmark Supreme Court case that paved the way for marriage equality for gay Americans. The firm soon gained national prominence because of her leadership in the #MeToo movement, and more recently for high-profile victories against white supremacists and former President Donald J. Trump. But those triumphs couldn\u2019t overcome an uncomfortable reality, according to people familiar with the law firm\u2019s internal dynamics. In the eyes of many of her colleagues, including the firm\u2019s two other named partners, Ms. Kaplan\u2019s poor treatment of other lawyers \u2014 ranging from micromanagement to vulgar insults and humiliating personal attacks \u2014 was impairing the boutique firm she had built, the people said. For one thing, they said, she was jeopardizing its ability to recruit and retain valuable employees.", "summary": "Roberta Kaplan\u2019s work as a lawyer made her a hero to the left.

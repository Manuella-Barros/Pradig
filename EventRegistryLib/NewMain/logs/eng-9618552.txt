The interview lasted 14 hours over the course of two days\n\nAt the time of the interview, the panel's chairman, Rep. Brad Wenstrup of Ohio, told CBS News that the interview and the exchanges were cordial and professional.\n\nGOP committee staff concluded in a memo of key takeaways that the lab leak theory about where the virus originated is \"not a conspiracy theory,\" pointing to comments from Fauci during the interview that it \"could be a lab leak or it could be a natural occurrence,\" though he noted that he believes the evidence he's seen suggests to him that it's more likely a natural occurrence.\n\nThe memo also claimed that certain pandemic policies lacked supporting scientific evidence, like the guidance to maintain a six-foot distance from others, vaccine mandates and masks for children.\n\nThe hearing comes days after committee Republicans demanded Fauci turn over some personal emails and questioned whether he had been communicating about official government work on his private accounts.\n\nA senior adviser to Fauci, Dr. David Morens, faced tough questioning last week from the panel over emails suggesting that he may have been circumventing federal Freedom of Information Act rules by using a \"secret back channel\" with Fauci.\n\nWenstrup thanked Fauci at the outset of Monday's hearing for his \"willing cooperation,\" citing his voluntary appearance at the January interview and at Monday's hearing.\n\n\"Beginning early in 2020, you became the figurehead of public health,\" Wenstrup said in his opening remarks. \"Americans from coast to coast and beyond listened to your words, and this is where I think we could have done better ... We should have been more precise, we should have used words and phrases that are accurate and not misleading. And we should have been honest, especially about what we didn't know.\"\n\nThe hearing quickly became more serious, as the committee chair questioned alleged misconduct that occurred under Fauci's leadership, claiming he allowed his office to be \"unaccountable to the American people.\"\n\n\"We have seen officials from your office, in their own writing, discussing breaking federal law, deleting official records, and sharing private government information with grant recipients. The office you directed and those serving under your leadership chose to flout the law and bragged about it,\" Wenstrup said.\n\nFauci distanced himself from the investigation into Morens, saying they worked in different buildings on the National Institutes of Health's campus. Morens worked with him only on helping to write some scientific papers, Fauci said, and was not an adviser to him on \"institute policy or other substantive issues.\"\n\n\"Let me state for the record, to the best of my knowledge, I have never conducted official business using my personal email,\" Fauci told the committee.\n\nFauci said many of Morens' actions were wrong and ran afoul of agency policy. He also directly contradicted Morens' claim, quoted from an email to the EcoHealth Alliance, that Fauci was trying to protect the group. EcoHealth Alliance and its NIH funding has faced scrutiny since early during the pandemic over its ties to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\n\"I don't know where he got that, but that's not true,\" said Fauci.\n\nFauci repeated a defense he has given for years of NIH's funding for the Wuhan Institute of Virology and EcoHealth Alliance. The agency's grant of $120,000 made up a small fraction of the institute's budget, Fauci said.\n\nFauci said the accusation that he influenced scientists working to determine whether the virus had originated in a lab by bribing them with grant money \"is absolutely false and simply preposterous.\" He also pushed back on the claim that he tried to cover up that the virus originated in the lab, saying he has \"always kept an open mind to the different possibilities.\"\n\n\"I cannot account, nor can anyone account, for other things that might be going on in China. Which is the reason why I have always said, and will say now, I keep an open mind as to what the origin is,\" he said, \"but the one thing I know for sure is that the viruses that were funded by the NIH, phylogenetically, could not be the precursor of SARS-CoV-2.\"\n\nCalifornia Rep. Raul Ruiz, the panel's top-ranking Democrat, blasted the subcommittee's Republican leadership for doing little to uncover new information on the origins of the virus or improve preparedness for future pandemics.\n\n\"After 15 months, the select subcommittee still does not possess a shred of evidence to substantiate these extreme allegations that Republicans have levied against Dr. Fauci for nearly four years,\" Ruiz said in his opening remarks.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, also came to Fauci's defense, saying House Republicans were using the subcommittee as a platform for \"disinformation\" about Fauci.\n\n\"House Republicans now find themselves in the familiar position where their own investigation debunks their runaway political rhetoric,\" Raskin said. \"The investigation of Dr. Fauci shows he is an honorable public servant who has devoted his entire career to the public health and the public interest -- and he is not a comic book super villain.\"\n\nMultiple Republican members questioned Fauci about the CDC's pandemic-era recommendations, like staying six feet apart for social distancing. Fauci acknowledged the precaution had not been studied in trials, and later turned out to be insufficient to stop spread of the virus through the air.\n\n\"We had discussions at the White House about that, we did, but this was the CDC's decision and was their decision to make and they made it,\" Fauci said.\n\nThe hearing intensified when Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, began a line of questioning, launching a number of serious accusations against Fauci -- including claiming that he had committed crimes against humanity -- and prompting a dispute between lawmakers over decorum that briefly sidelined the hearing.\n\nAfter Greene's remark, Rep. Robert Garcia, a California Democrat, called the session the \"most insane hearing\" he'd ever attended.\n\nSome Republicans on the panel, including Greene, also criticized Fauci over animal experiments funded by the agency and patent royalties earned by NIH scientists. Fauci defended the animal experiments as having been vetted by NIAID and said he had earned little in royalties, aside from $120 from an antibody invented years before the pandemic.\n\nFauci's testimony, along with the closed-door interview, are expected to be included among the subcommittee's final report on its investigation, which will come late this year.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigations_into_the_origin_of_COVID-19", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Investigations into the origin of COVID-19"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

The select subcommittee has taken testimony from EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak and David Morens, a senior adviser to the NIAID director who worked closely with Fauci.

It marks the first time he's publicly testified since he left the federal government at the end of 2022 after five decades of service.\n\nFauci's appearance on Capitol Hill comes amid a contentious election cycle, with Republicans continuing to hammer him on his response to the virus -- everything from mask mandates to vaccine guidelines and origin possibilities.\n\n\"Americans were aggressively bullied, shamed and silenced for merely questioning or debating issues such as social distancing, masks, vaccines or the origins of COVID,\" chairman Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, said as the hearing kicked off. Wenstrup, who said he was seeking accountability in this hearing, accused Fauci of overseeing \"one of the most invasive regimes of domestic policy the U.S. has ever seen.\"\n\nFauci addressed those issues, and Republican attacks, in his opening statement, calling certain matters \"seriously distorted.\"\n\nFauci forcefully denied GOP accusations that he meddled in research about the pandemic's origins, including claims that he tried to sway scientists away from concluding the virus came from a lab.\n\n\"The accusation being circulated that I influenced the scientists to change their minds by bribing them with millions of dollars in grant money is absolutely false, and simply preposterous,\" he said.\n\n\"The second issue is a false accusation that I tried to cover up the possibility that the virus originated from a lab. In fact, the truth is exactly the opposite,\" he added, proceeding to read an email in which he encouraged scientists to report their data to authorities.\n\nDemocrats, led by ranking member Raul Ruiz, sought to focus on moving forward -- and accused Republicans of using Fauci as a scapegoat for mistakes made during the early days of the pandemic by former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"After 15 months, the select subcommittee does not possess a shred of evidence to substantiate these extreme allegations Republicans have levied against Dr. Fauci for nearly four years,\" Ruiz said.\n\nTensions boiled over when Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of Fauci's most passionate detractors, said his license should be revoked and he should be imprisoned. She was stopped by chair Rep. Wenstrup, a fellow Republican, because of a lack of decorum. Democrats defended Fauci in the aftermath, with Rep. Robert Garcia calling Greene's comments \"completely irresponsible.\"\n\nThe latest attack on Fauci comes from Republicans on the subcommittee who cite \"new evidence\" they say warrants further scrutiny: an email exchange between a former Fauci senior adviser and an executive of a virus research organization where the adviser claims Fauci's private Gmail account could be utilized to evade Freedom of Information Act and future public scrutiny. Ahead of the hearing, Republicans requested access to Fauci's personal email account and cellphone records.\n\nFauci denied suggestions he used his private email, and both denounced and distanced himself from the adviser's actions.\n\n\"Let me state for the record that to the best of my knowledge I have never conducted official business via my personal email,\" Fauci said.\n\nDr. David Morens, the Fauci aide, advised EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak that Fauci may accept printed copies of documents if Daszak didn't want them tracked for the public record -- although it's not clear if Fauci ever had any involvement.\n\nRecords show that Morens himself used his private Gmail account to shield information from FOIA's reach, including to send Daszak official government documents and a heads-up about information that would become public through a FOIA request pertaining to EcoHealth Alliance grant materials and COVID-19 research.\n\nEcoHealth Alliance is a U.S.-based organization -- described as a \"virus-hunting group\" -- that conducts research and outreach programs and global health, conservation and international development, according to its website.\n\nRepublicans say the alliance facilitated gain-of-function research in Wuhan, China, without proper oversight; willingly violated multiple requirements of its multi-million dollar National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant; and, apparently, made false statements to the NIH.\n\nThe House select subcommittee released a report alleging wrongdoing there and the formal debarment of EcoHealth and Daszak. Health and Human Services has subsequently suspended U.S. funding to the organization, which totaled about $2.6 million last year.\n\nMorens testified behind closed doors for transcribed interviews before the subcommittee on Jan 18., and later produced an additional 30,000 pages of documents pursuant to a subpoena before testifying publicly on May 22.\n\nConsidering Morens was a close adviser to Fauci, Republicans on the subcommittee expressed concern that Fauci had knowledge of his conduct and questioned whether Fauci potentially engaged in any misconduct himself.\n\nFauci told lawmakers on Monday he \"knew nothing\" of Morens' actions with Daszak or EcoHealth, and asserted Morens was not \"an adviser to me on institute policy or other substantive issues.\"\n\nFauci, 83, served as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, serving as a scientific check to Trump during the pandemic and later as President Joe Biden's chief medical advisor before retiring in 2022.\n\nFauci previously spoke out about the death threats he received due to his outsized and public role from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. On Monday, he said those threats continue and became emotional while answering questions about the impact on his family.\n\n\"It is very troublesome to me. It is much more troublesome because they've involved my wife and my three daughters,\" he said, his voice beginning to waver.\n\n\"At this moment, how do you feel?\" pushed Democratic Rep.

The interview lasted 14 hours over the course of two days\n\nAt the time of the interview, the panel's chairman, Rep. Brad Wenstrup of Ohio, told CBS News that the interview and the exchanges were cordial and professional.\n\nBut GOP committee staff concluded in a memo of key takeaways that the lab leak theory about where the virus originated is \"not a conspiracy theory,\" pointing to comments from Fauci during the interview that it \"could be a lab leak or it could be a natural occurrence,\" though he noted that he believes the evidence he's seen suggests to him that it's more likely a natural occurrence.\n\nThe memo also claimed that certain pandemic policies lacked supporting scientific evidence, like the guidance to maintain a six-foot distance from others, vaccine mandates and masks for children.\n\nThe hearing comes days after committee Republicans demanded Fauci turn over some personal emails and questioned whether he had been communicating about official government work on his private accounts.\n\nA senior adviser to Fauci, Dr. David Morens, faced tough questioning last week from the panel over emails suggesting that he may have been circumventing federal Freedom of Information Act rules by using a \"secret back channel\" with Fauci.\n\nWenstrup thanked Fauci at the outset of Monday's hearing for his \"willing cooperation,\" citing his voluntary appearance at the January interview and at Monday's hearing.\n\n\"Beginning early in 2020, you became the figurehead of public health,\" Wenstrup said in his opening remarks. \"Americans from coast to coast and beyond listened to your words, and this is where I think we could have done better ... We should have been more precise, we should have used words and phrases that are accurate and not misleading. And we should have been honest, especially about what we didn't know.\"\n\nThe hearing quickly became more serious, as the committee chair questioned alleged misconduct that occurred under Fauci's leadership, claiming he allowed his office to be \"unaccountable to the American people.\"\n\n\"We have seen officials from your office, in their own writing, discussing breaking federal law, deleting official records, and sharing private government information with grant recipients. The office you directed and those serving under your leadership chose to flout the law and bragged about it,\" Wenstrup said.\n\nFauci distanced himself from the investigation into Morens, saying they worked in different buildings on the National Institutes of Health's campus. Morens worked with him only on helping to write some scientific papers, Fauci said, and was not an adviser to him on \"institute policy or other substantive issues.\"\n\n\"Let me state for the record, to the best of my knowledge, I have never conducted official business using my personal email,\" Fauci told the committee.\n\nFauci said many of Morens' actions were wrong and ran afoul of agency policy. He also directly contradicted Morens' claim, quoted from an email to the EcoHealth Alliance, that Fauci was trying to protect the group. EcoHealth Alliance and its NIH funding has faced scrutiny since early during the pandemic over its ties to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\n\"I don't know where he got that, but that's not true,\" said Fauci.\n\nFauci also refuted the accusation that he influenced scientists who were working to determine whether the virus had originated in a lab by bribing them with grant money, saying the accusation \"is absolutely false and simply preposterous.\" He also pushed back on the claim that he tried to cover up that the virus originated in the lab, saying he has \"always kept an open mind to the different possibilities.\"\n\nCalifornia Rep. Raul Ruiz, the panel's top-ranking Democrat, blasted the subcommittee's Republican leadership for doing little to uncover new information on the origins of the virus or improve preparedness for future pandemics.\n\n\"After 15 months, the select subcommittee still does not possess a shred of evidence to substantiate these extreme allegations that Republicans have levied against Dr. Fauci for nearly four years,\" Ruiz said in his opening remarks.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, also came to Fauci's defense, saying House Republicans were using the subcommittee as a platform for \"disinformation\" about Fauci.\n\n\"House Republicans now find themselves in the familiar position where their own investigation debunks their runaway political rhetoric,\" Raskin said. \"The investigation of Dr. Fauci shows he is an honorable public servant who has devoted his entire career to the public health and the public interest -- and he is not a comic book super villain.\"\n\nFauci's testimony, along with the closed-door interview, are expected to be included among the subcommittee's final report on its investigation, which will come late this year.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigations_into_the_origin_of_COVID-19", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Investigations into the origin of COVID-19"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

It will mark the first time he's publicly testified since he left the federal government at the end of 2022 after five decades of service.\n\nFauci's appearance on Capitol Hill comes amid a contentious election cycle, with Republicans continuing to hammer him on his response to the virus -- everything from mask mandates to vaccine guidelines and origin possibilities. Fauci is set to address those issues, and Republican attacks, in his opening statement.\n\nDespite Fauci's outsized and public role from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, former President Donald Trump, the Republican presumptive presidential nominee, is now contending Fauci \"wasn't a big player in my administration\" as Fauci becomes a political lightning rod and a potential liability for Democrats ahead of this fall's presidential contest.\n\nMORE: COVID-19 timeline: How the deadly virus and the world's response have evolved over 4 years\n\nDemocrats on the panel, in a news conference on Monday before Fauci's testimony, announced the release of a staff report \"debunking point by point Republicans' dangerous narrative\" regarding Fauci.\n\n\"Rather than tackling forward-looking reforms to strengthen public health, data collection, improve future testing and contact tracing capacity, or address the inequities laid bare by the pandemic, our majority colleagues have spent time and taxpayer dollars fishing for evidence to back up their most extreme members' claims about Dr Fauci,\" said Democratic Rep. Raul Ruiz, the ranking member of the panel and a physician.\n\nThe latest attack on Fauci comes from Republicans on the subcommittee who cite \"new evidence\" they say warrants further scrutiny: an email exchange between a former Fauci senior adviser and an executive of a virus research organization where the adviser claims Fauci's private Gmail account could be utilized to evade Freedom of Information Act and future public scrutiny.\n\nFauci, in his opening statement, will push back against that assertion and tell lawmakers: \"Let me state for the record that to the best of my knowledge I have never conducted official business via my personal email.\"\n\nDr. David Morens, the Fauci aide, advised EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak that Fauci may accept printed copies of documents if Daszak didn't want them tracked for the public record -- although it's not clear if Fauci ever had any involvement.\n\nRecords show that Morens himself used his private Gmail account to shield information from FOIA's reach, including to send Daszak official government documents and a heads-up about information that would become public through a FOIA request pertaining to EcoHealth Alliance grant materials and COVID-19 research.\n\nEcoHealth Alliance is a U.S.-based organization -- described as a \"virus-hunting group\" -- that conducts research and outreach programs and global health, conservation and international development, according to its website.\n\nRepublicans say the alliance facilitated gain-of-function research in Wuhan, China, without proper oversight; willingly violated multiple requirements of its multi-million dollar National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant; and, apparently, made false statements to the NIH.\n\nThe House select subcommittee released a report alleging wrongdoing there and the formal debarment of EcoHealth and Daszak. Health and Human Services has subsequently suspended U.S. funding to the organization, which totaled about $2.6 million last year.\n\nMorens testified behind closed doors for transcribed interviews before the subcommittee on Jan 18., and later produced an additional 30,000 pages of documents pursuant to a subpoena before testifying publicly on May 22.\n\nThe panel subsequently released a staff memorandum it argues \"presents overwhelming evidence\" from Morens's email revealing misconduct and potentially illegal actions. The memo included previously unreleased emails, obtained by subpoena, that Republicans believe incriminates Morens by showing he undermined the operations of the U.S. government, unlawfully deleted federal COVID-19 records and used personal email to avoid FOIA.\n\nConsidering Morens was a close adviser to Fauci, Republicans on the subcommittee expressed concern that Fauci had knowledge of his conduct and questioned whether Fauci potentially engaged in any misconduct himself.\n\nFauci, in his opening statement, will say that he \"knew nothing\" of Morens' actions with Daszak or EcoHealth.\n\nThe request pertaining to Fauci's personal records specifies that the subcommittee is seeking access to all documents and communications related to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, EcoHealth, and the origins of COVID-19 retained in Dr. Fauci's personal email and cellphone records.\n\nFauci previously sat for closed-door, transcribed interviews with the panel for 14 hours on Jan. 8 and 9 -- before the latest records from Morens were combed through by the panel.\n\nMORE: As Dr. Anthony Fauci leaves public service, he fears health misinformation\n\nFauci served as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, serving as a scientific check to Trump during the pandemic and later as President Joe Biden's chief medical advisor before retiring in 2022.\n\n\"Retirement from public service does not excuse Dr. Fauci from accountability to the American people,\" chairman Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, noted in a statement announcing the hearing. \"On June 3, Americans will have an opportunity to hear directly from Dr. Fauci about his role in overseeing our nation's pandemic response, shaping pandemic-era policies, and promoting singular, questionable narratives about the origins of COVID-19.\"\n\nFauci, 83, is set to publish his memoir, entitled \"ON CALL: A Doctor's Journey in Public Service,\" on June 18. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by George W. Bush in 2008 for his work on AIDS relief in Africa.\n\nABC News' Cheyenne Haslett and Lalee Ibsaa contributed to this report", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

He is expected to face grilling from Congressional Republicans over the origins of the virus as well as transparency around government agency communications and records.\n\nThe former head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is sitting for his first congressional testimony in almost two years.\n\nThe GOP-led subcommittee has requested access to Dr Fauci's personal email and phone records after obtaining information, which, they say, calls into question whether he may have attempted to conceal some records.\n\nDr Fauci is appearing voluntarily on Monday. He has said that he has \"nothing to hide.\"\n\nThe divide between the Democrats and Republicans approach to the hearing is striking. One Democrat called this effort a \"waste of time\" while Republicans have pressed Fauci about conspiracies that have cropped up about the origins of Covid, including the lab leak theory and Fauci's alleged 'cover up'.\n\n17:24 , Kelly Rissman\n\nDemocratic Representative Jamie Raskin has slammed Republicans for \"bowing to convicted felon\" Donald Trump after he told Americans to inject bleach to cure Covid-19 at the height of the pandemic.\n\nDr Anthony Fauci was called to testify before the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic's hearing on Monday, as House Republicans have sought to scrutinize his role as one of the chief faces of the federal government's response to the pandemic.\n\nRepublicans have also baselessly floated the idea that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases funded so-called gain-of-function research that led to the spread of Covid-19.\n\nRaskin instantly defended Dr Fauci from accusations that he had orchestrated the proliferation of Covid-19 while also attacking former president Trump and Republicans who bended to his will.\n\nRaskin said that the hearing was meant to divert attention from the Trump administration's failures to save lives and compared it to the failure of the Oversight Committee to find wrongdoing by President Joe Biden during its bungled impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"The investigation of Dr Fauci shows he is an honorable public servant who has devoted his entire career to the public health and the public interest and he is not a comic book super villain,\" he said.\n\nDemocratic Rep Garcia immediately apologized for Ms Greene's comments.\n\nGOP Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene began her fiery testimony by holding up posters with dogs being tested on.\n\nShe called experiments on animals were \"disgusting and evil\" and accused Fauci of \"signing off\" on these allegeed experiments on dogs.\n\n\"What do dogs have to do with anything we are here for today?\" Fauci asked.\n\nGreene then asked him a question ending him as \"Mister Fauci.\" She added, \"You're not Doctor. You're Mister Fauci in these few minutes.\"\n\nShe then called for his license to be revoked and that he should \"be in prison!\"\n\nChair Wenstrup enforced rules of decorum after Greene's outburst.\n\nShe then took issue with the notion that GOP members \"worship\" Trump, but was interrupted by Chair Wenstrup yelling, \"Gentlelady will suspend!\"\n\n17:02 , Kelly Rissman\n\nThe GOP has repeatedly pressed Fauci about the six-foot distance recommendation imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Fauci explained that the six-foot rule came from the CDC.\n\nRep Joyce asked, \"what was your relationship with the CDC when you saw a regulation that was not based in the current science?\"\n\nFauci clarified that there wasn't a clinical trial that concluded that six feet was more effective than three or 10 feet.\n\nThe Congressman asked, \"This six-foot rule crippled businesses, it allowed children to stay at home and not learn...Did you not feel an obligation for something that 'just sort of appeared'?\"\n\nIt was a CDC decision, Fauci said.\n\nJoyce asked whether he publicly challenged the CDC? Fauci said it's \"not appropriate\" to publicly challenge the CDC.\n\n16:55 , Kelly Rissman\n\nDemocratic Rep Deborah Ross asked Dr Fauci about the vaccine -- one of the most contested aspects of the pandemic response.\n\nFauci said \"the difference is profound\" in the number of hospitalizations and deaths for those who were vaccinated compared to those who were not.\n\nThe vaccine \"clearly saved many many lives,\" Fauci said.\n\nRep Ross asked about addressing misinformation. \"That's difficult when you have a very energetic group of poeople spreaking mis and disinformation about vaccines,\" Fauci replied.\n\n16:48 , Kelly Rissman\n\nMaryland Rep Mfume called out Rep Malliotakis about asking Fauci about the \"cruel animal tests\".\n\nFauci said that he wasn't sure what that had to do with Covid. She called the experiments \"not very humane.\"\n\n\"If I might on a point of personal privilege to the gentlewoman from New York who wanted to argue that we should be worrying about testing human medicines on animals. If this committee really wants to do something, let's talk about the most infamous biomedical research study in the United States: The Tuskegee study.\"\n\n16:41 , Kelly Rissman\n\nFauci pushed back on the idea that he tried to \"suppress\" the \"lab leak theory\" in an article.\n\nRepublican Rep Lesko asked if he was asked to suppress the lab leak theory. He rejected that idea, adding \"you said four or five things that were untrue.\"\n\nRep Debbie Dingell asked about the threats Dr Fauci has received since the start of the pandemic.\n\n\"Everything from harassment by emails, texts, letters of myself, my wife, my three daughters. There have been credible death threats leading to the arrest of two individuals...it has required my having protective services all the time,\" Fauci said.\n\n\"It is very troublesome to me because they involve my wife and my three daughters,\" he added, seemingly choking up.\n\nHe said he still gets death threats today.\n\n\"You deserve better....I'm afraid that the treatment you have received will have far-reaching consequences for the future of science, particularly when done for the public good,\" Rep Dingell said.\n\n\"I think this is a powerful disincentive for young people to want to go into public health and maybe even science and medicine in the public arena,\" Fauci said. He added that his colleagues who are less \"visible\" have also received threats.\n\nRep Castor said that these subcommittees are meant to bring \"light\" to certain matters but unfortuantely in this circumstance, this subcommittee has \"brought more heat than light.\"\n\nFor five months, Republicans sat on Dr Fauci's interview with the subcommittee from January.\n\nAlthough they had an opportunity to release it before then, but decided to release the transcript this past week. \"Republicans contorted and mischaracterized Dr Fauci's words to gin up conspiracies about NIH's role and the lead-up to the pandemic.\" She gave Fauci an opportunity to clear up any parts of his 14-hour transcript that has been \"cherry-picked,\" as she put it.\n\nHe said the \"issue of the six-foot distance\" came from the CDC.\n\nThe transcript, released on May 31 despite the interview taking place months earlier, shows Dr Fauci explaining the six-foot distance recommendation saying, \"You know, I don't recall. It sort of just appeared. I don't recall, like, a discussion of whether it should be 5 or 6 or whatever. It was just that 6 foot is -- \"\n\nOn Monday, he clarified, \"What I meant by 'no science behind it' was that there was no controlled trial\" comparing three feet versus 10 feet to six feet. \"It had little to do with me...'no science behind it' means there was no clinical trial.\"\n\n16:09 , Kelly Rissman\n\nRaskin directly asked, \"I'm sure you've never been accused of starting a disease before. Is that right?\" Fauci agreed.\n\nThe Democratic Rep then addressed allegations that Fauci tried to \"cover up\" a lab leak before apologizing on behalf of his GOP colleagues for \"dragging his name\" through the mud.\n\n\"They are treating you like a convicted felon. You probably wish they were treating you like a convicted felon. They treat convicted felons with love and admiration,\" Raskin said, referring to former president Donald Trump who was just found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records.\n\nRep Ruiz said after reviewing nearly half a million pages of documents, listening to witnesses, \"they have come up empty handed for evidence of their extreme allegations that Dr Fauci lied about gain-of-function research and caused the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHe asked Dr Fauci if he was personally involved in the gain-of-function research. He responded that the research was done by experts below him.\n\n\"No evidence provided to this select subcommittee demonstrates that the work performed under NIH funding, including at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, led to the creation of Sars-CoV-2,\" Ruiz said.\n\nFauci talked about the \"evolution\" of a virus. Those studied at the Wuhan Institute are \"so far removed from Sars-CoV-2\" that it is \"molecularly impossible\" for those viruses to have been \"made into Sars-CoV-2.\" It's a \"virological fact.\"\n\n15:50 , Kelly Rissman\n\nChair Brad Wenstrup fires off a series of questions about someone that Dr Fauci said he didn't know. \"Does it concern you that US taxpayer dollars would be going to someone who is a high-ranking PLA official?\"\n\nDr Fauci said he needed to know more information and said he repeated that he didn't recognize the name of the person who allegedly received the medical grant.\n\nWenstrup has repeatedly cut off Fauci's responses to his questions.\n\n\"Thank you for this opportunity to testify,\" he began. He said he has been at the NIH for 54 years and was director of the NIAID for 38 years.\n\nHe addressed \"certain issues that have been seriously distorted concerning me,\" the infectious disease expert continued.\n\nHe first mentioned the lab leak theory. \"The accusation being circulated that I influenced these scientists to change their minds with millions of dollars in grant money is absolutely false and simply preposterous,\" Dr Fauci said.\n\nHe then addressed the accusations that he allegedly tried to \"cover up\" the possibility that the virus originated from a lab.\n\n\"The truth is exactly the opposite,\" he said matter-of-factly. He then read an email, adding, \"It is inconceivable that anvone who reads this e-mail could conclude that I was trying to 'cover up' the possibility ofa laboratory leak. To the contrary, it demonstrates that I was advocating for a prompt and thorough examination ofthe data and a totally transparent process.\"\n\n15:35 , Kelly Rissman\n\nDemocrat Kathy Castor said, \"This committee has wasted time and taxpayer money fueling conspiracy theoires and ignoring the importance of preparing for the next pandemic.\"\n\n\"I regret that many of the conspiracies have smeared you, Dr Fauci,\" she added.\n\nHer comments echoed those of Ranking Member Ruiz, who also called for his Congressional colleagues to focus on preparing for the next pandemic rather than focusing on political differences.\n\n\"It's not too late for Republicans to join us,\" she said.\n\n\"It is hard to believe that all of this occurred without your knowledge or approval,\" he said, referring to alleged \"missing information.\"\n\nResearch shows \"how little oversight NIAID does of risky experiments involving potential pandemic pathogens,\" the Republican Congressman added.\n\n15:28 , Kelly Rissman\n\nDr Ruiz gave his remaining time to Democratic Rep Jamie Raskin.\n\n\"The people who claimed the political big lie....bring you the medical big lie, making the outlandish claim that Dr Fauci was responsible for causing Covid-19.\"\n\nRecords show Dr Fauci is an \"honorable public servant\" and not a \"comic book supervillain.\"\n\n15:24 , Kelly Rissman\n\nRanking member, Democratic Congressman Raul Ruiz, is now speaking. He immediately offered support to Dr Fauci.\n\nAfter setting the stage, discussing how Dr Fauci has been villified by Republicans, the ranking member said the select subcommittee has not possessed a \"shred of evidence\" to substantiate these \"extreme allegations\" against Dr Fauci for the last four years.\n\nHe then said, \"baselessly suggesting without evidence that these discrete instances of misconduct\" are equivalent to public health officials \"causing\" the pandemic is \"also a betrayal of public trust.\"\n\nCongressman Ruiz said he hopes Congress can prioritize looking into \"solutions to better prepare us for the next pandemic\" rather than politicizing certain public health officials.\n\n15:16 , Kelly Rissman\n\nDr Fauci sits for his first Congressional testimony in two years -- and his first time as a non-government official.\n\nThe hearing began at 10am.\n\nChair Brad Wenstrup is kicking off the meeting, asking \"Why did you allow your office to be unaccountable to the American people?\"\n\n\"Whether intentional or not, you became so powerful, that any disagreements that the public had with you were hidden or censored on social....This is why many Americans became so angry. Because this was fundamentally un-American,\" Congressman Wenstrup said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lab_leak_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lab leak theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

As schools closed and small businesses called it quits, we were all faced with a dire ultimatum: Stay 6 feet apart, wear a mask and get the vaccine... or kiss your right to participate in society goodbye.\n\nAnd now, testimony from Dr. Anthony Fauci reveals those guidelines were really just made up.\n\nFauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, will testify Monday before the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic. But ahead of the much-anticipated hearing, Republicans put out the full transcript of their sit-down interview with Fauci in January. And it has some real bombshells.\n\nRemember not being allowed to visit your grandmother during the pandemic -- for fear you might transmit COVID and send her to her grave? Remember having to watch weddings and funerals via Zoom? Or not being allowed to hug your friends, go to restaurants or even get a haircut?\n\nWell, Fauci told Republicans that that 6-foot social distancing rule was really kind of random and that he doesn't know how it started.\n\n\"You know, I don't recall. It sort of just appeared,\" he said according to committee transcripts after being pressed on how the rule came about.\n\nHe added he \"was not aware of studies\" that supported social distancing, conceding that such studies \"would be very difficult\" to do.\n\nBut hey, sorry you couldn't visit your sick dad in the hospital!\n\nAnd then there were the masks. No mask, no entry -- to the store, to the airplane, to the party, nothing. Some people even wore double masks and face shields, terrified of the fear porn being pushed out by Fauci and the government he was advising. Even little kids had to cover their faces at school. When they were finally allowed to go to school, that is.\n\nSo they asked Fauci about that, too.\n\n\"Do you recall reviewing any studies or data supporting masking for children?\" he was asked, according to the transcript.\n\nFauci responded: \"You know, I might have... but I don't recall specifically that I did. I might have.\"\n\nI might have. Trust the science, right?\n\nFauci also testified that he had not followed any studies after the fact regarding the impacts that forced mask wearing had on children, even though there have been many.\n\n\"I still think that's up in the air,\" he said.\n\nThose revelations are just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nA batch of emails obtained by the subcommittee also show that Fauci's former senior adviser at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Dr. David Morens, admitted to using a private account to evade Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests about EcoHealth's Wuhan grant, claimed he deleted records related to it -- and said he helped his boss to do the same through a \"secret back channel.\"\n\n\"At one point, Dr. Morens said that he never talked to Tony Fauci about the Wuhan Institute of Virology and EcoHealth Alliance,\" Brand Wenstrup (R-Ohio) said, adding that Morens confirmed the emails were sent but dismissed them as \"jokes.\"\n\nREAD: New Report Confirms Fauci, Other 'Experts' Misled Public About COVID Research\n\nFurther, Fauci admitted to the committee in January that he never looked at the grants that he signed off on, some of which total to millions of taxpayer dollars.\n\nAnthony Fauci was the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Anything he said, went -- no matter how unscientific or harmful it was to education, the economy and everything in between. On Monday, he'll have to answer for the damage done.\n\nIn the wake of Donald Trump's conviction, President Joe Biden and all the Democrats have been telling us that no one is above the law.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amber_harding@outkick.com", "name": "Amber Harding", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

It will mark the first time he's publicly testified since he left the federal government at the end of 2022 after five decades of service.\n\nFauci's appearance on Capitol Hill comes amid a contentious election cycle, with Republicans continuing to hammer him on his response to the virus -- everything from mask mandates to vaccine guidelines and origin possibilities.\n\nDespite Fauci's outsized and public role from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, former President Donald Trump, the Republican presumptive presidential nominee, is now contending Fauci \"wasn't a big player in my administration\" as Fauci becomes a political lightning rod and a potential liability for Democrats ahead of this fall's presidential contest.\n\nThe latest attack on Fauci comes from Republicans on the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, who cite \"new evidence\" they say warrants further scrutiny: an email exchange between a former Fauci senior adviser and an executive of a virus research organization where the adviser claims Fauci's private Gmail account could be utilized to evade Freedom of Information Act and future public scrutiny.\n\nDr. David Morens, the Fauci aide, advised EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak that Fauci may accept printed copies of documents if Daszak didn't want them tracked for the public record -- although it's not clear if Fauci ever had any involvement.\n\nRecords show that Morens himself used his private Gmail account to shield information from FOIA's reach, including to send Daszak official government documents and a heads-up about information that would become public through a FOIA request pertaining to EcoHealth Alliance grant materials and COVID-19 research.\n\nEcoHealth Alliance is a U.S.-based organization -- described as a \"virus-hunting group\" -- that conducts research and outreach programs and global health, conservation and international development, according to its website.\n\nRepublicans say the alliance facilitated gain-of-function research in Wuhan, China, without proper oversight; willingly violated multiple requirements of its multi-million dollar National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant; and, apparently, made false statements to the NIH.\n\nThe House select subcommittee released a report alleging wrongdoing there and the formal debarment of EcoHealth and Daszak. Health and Human Services has subsequently suspended U.S. funding to the organization, which totaled about $2.6 million last year.\n\nMorens testified behind closed doors for transcribed interviews before the subcommittee on Jan 18., and later produced an additional 30,000 pages of documents pursuant to a subpoena before testifying publicly on May 22.\n\nThe panel subsequently released a staff memorandum it argues \"presents overwhelming evidence\" from Morens's email revealing misconduct and potentially illegal actions. The memo included previously unreleased emails, obtained by subpoena, that Republicans believe incriminates Morens by showing he undermined the operations of the U.S. government, unlawfully deleted federal COVID-19 records and used personal email to avoid FOIA.\n\nConsidering Morens was a close adviser to Fauci, Republicans on the subcommittee expressed concern that Fauci had knowledge of his conduct and questioned whether Fauci potentially engaged in any misconduct himself.\n\nThe request pertaining to Fauci's personal records specifies that the subcommittee is seeking access to all documents and communications related to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, EcoHealth, and the origins of COVID-19 retained in Dr. Fauci's personal email and cellphone records.\n\nFauci previously sat for closed-door, transcribed interviews with the panel for 14 hours on Jan. 8 and 9 -- before the latest records from Morens were combed through by the panel.\n\nFauci served as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, serving as a scientific check to Trump during the pandemic and later as President Joe Biden's chief medical advisor before retiring in 2022.\n\n\"Retirement from public service does not excuse Dr. Fauci from accountability to the American people,\" chairman Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, noted in a statement announcing the hearing. \"On June 3, Americans will have an opportunity to hear directly from Dr. Fauci about his role in overseeing our nation's pandemic response, shaping pandemic-era policies, and promoting singular, questionable narratives about the origins of COVID-19.\"\n\nFauci, 83, is set to publish his memoir, entitled \"ON CALL: A Doctor's Journey in Public Service,\" on June 18. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by George W. Bush in 2008 for his work on AIDS relief in Africa.\n\nIn addition to hearing from Fauci, the Select Subcommittee announced former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky will publicly testify on June 13 as Republicans seek to learn about her knowledge of CDC policies and decisions during the pandemic.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

It's his first testimony since leaving government work at the end of 2022.\n\nThe last time he testified before Congress was in September 2022, when he appeared before the Senate Health Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to discuss the response to the mpox response along with other health officials.\n\nFauci did return to the Capitol earlier this year for two days of closed-door interviews with the subcommittee. Transcripts of those all-day interviews were published Friday ahead of the hearing.\n\nHis testimony comes on the heels of two highly contentious hearings before the subcommittee that raised questions over the level of oversight and conduct that went on in his agency, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic that raised him to public prominence.\n\nHere's what to know ahead of what could be a testy hearing.\n\nFauci is likely to get tough questions from Republicans about what he knew of efforts by another NIAID official accused of evading public records laws.\n\nOver the past month, the select subcommittee has taken testimony from EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak and David Morens, a senior adviser to the NIAID director who worked closely with Fauci.\n\nMorens's testimony did little to endear Republicans to Fauci. Previously publicized emails from Morens suggested Fauci knew of public records misconduct at NIAID and sought to detach himself from it.\n\nIn one email exchange with Daszak, Morens wrote, \"... there is no worry about FOIAs. I can either send stuff to Tony on his private gmail, or hand it to him at work or at his house. He is too smart to let colleagues send him stuff that could cause trouble.\"\n\nIn another email, Morens told Daszak that Fauci was seeking to protect EcoHealth from scrutiny, though in other emails, he indicated that the former NIAID director wasn't particularly involved in National Institutes of Health grants.

Fauci also conceded that the lab leak theory is a \"possible\" explanation for the origins of COVID-19.\n\nOn Friday, the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic released 500 pages of transcripts of a congressional interview with Fauci that was conducted in January 2024.\n\nDuring the interview, Fauci was asked if there were any scientific studies showing that the 6-foot social distancing guidelines were an effective deterrent to spreading the coronavirus.\n\nFauci - who was the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for nearly four decades - responded, \"I was not aware of studies that in fact, that would be a very difficult study to do.\"\n\nFauci was a top leader of the White House Coronavirus Task Force under former President Donald Trump and the Chief Medical Advisor to President Joe Biden.\n\nAlso during the congressional interview, Fauci was asked if he recalled \"reviewing any studies or data supporting masking for children?\"\n\nHe replied that he \"might have,\" but added, \"I don't recall specifically that I did.\"\n\nFauci was then questioned if he had seen any of the scientific studies showing children wearing masks suffered learning loss as well as speech and development issues.\n\nFauci answered, \"No. But I believe that there are a lot of conflicting studies too, that there are those that say, yes, there is an impact, and there are those that say there's not. I still think that's up in the air.\"\n\nDuring the interview, Fauci was asked if he believed that the coronavirus had the origin of a \"laboratory accident\" or if the lab leak was a conspiracy theory.\n\n\"Well, it's a possibility. I think people have made conspiracy aspects from it. And I think you have to separate the two when you keep an open mind, that it could be a lab leak or it could be a natural occurrence,\" Fauci said.\n\nHe continued, \"I've mentioned in this committee that I believe the evidence that I've seen weighs my opinion towards one, which is a natural occurrence, but I still leave an open mind. So I think that in and of itself isn't inherently a conspiracy theory, but some people spin off things from that that are kind of crazy.\"\n\nThe subcommittee asked if we'll ever know the origins of the COVID-19 virus, to which he replied that the lack of cooperation from the Chinese government \"makes it less and less likely that we'll ever know.\"\n\nThe release of the transcripts arrived just days before Fauci is set to testify in his first public hearing since his retirement in December 2022.\n\nFauci will testify before the House's COVID Select Subcommittee on Monday.\n\nSubcommittee Chairman Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-OH) said in a statement: \"Retirement from public service does not excuse Dr. Fauci from accountability to the American people. On June 3, Americans will have an opportunity to hear directly from Dr. Fauci about his role in overseeing our nation's pandemic response, shaping pandemic-era polices, and promoting singular questionable narratives about the origins of COVID-19.\"\n\n\"A lot of Fauci deputies are starting to talk,\" Kibbe stated. \"We had a former NIH director announce in testimony that of course we were doing gain-of-function research. So pretty much a smoking gun.\"\n\nBlaze Media recently released the new docuseries, \"The Coverup,\" which Kibbe said the investigative series will \"shine light on the shadowy government figures who caused so much pain and suffering with their tyrannical overreach during the pandemic.\"\n\nHe contended, \"They would rather we not uncover what really happened. They want us to just move on.

It's his first testimony since leaving government work at the end of 2022.\n\nThe last time he testified before Congress was in September 2022, when he appeared before the Senate Health Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to discuss the response to the mpox response along with other health officials.\n\nFauci did return to the Capitol earlier this year for two days of closed-door interviews with the subcommittee. Transcripts of those all-day interviews were published Friday ahead of the hearing.\n\nHis testimony comes on the heels of two highly contentious hearings before the subcommittee that raised questions over the level of oversight and conduct that went on in his agency, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic that raised him to public prominence.\n\nHere's what to know ahead of what could be a testy hearing.\n\nPublic records controversy\n\nFauci is likely to get tough questions from Republicans about what he knew of efforts by another NIAID official accused of evading public records laws.\n\nOver the past month, the select subcommittee has taken testimony from EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak and David Morens, a senior adviser to the NIAID director who worked closely with Fauci.\n\nMorens's testimony did little to endear Republicans to Fauci. Previously publicized emails from Morens suggested Fauci knew of public records misconduct at NIAID and sought to detach himself from it.\n\nIn one email exchange with Daszak, Morens wrote, \"... there is no worry about FOIAs. I can either send stuff to Tony on his private gmail, or hand it to him at work or at his house. He is too smart to let colleagues send him stuff that could cause trouble.\"\n\nIn another email, Morens told Daszak that Fauci was seeking to protect EcoHealth from scrutiny, though in other emails, he indicated that the former NIAID director wasn't particularly involved in National Institutes of Health grants.

EcoHealth plans to appeal the decision.\n\nFauci said there was no way NIH's funding could have yielded COVID-19 because the viruses EcoHealth was studying under the grant \"were phylogenetically so far removed from SARS-CoV-2 that it is molecularly impossible for those viruses to have evolved.\"\n\nIn addition, he said the research did not involve the regulatory and operative definition of \"gain of function\" -- the practice of enhancing a virus in a lab to study its potential impact in the real world. Rep. Raul Ruiz, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the committee, said some Republicans were using a broader definition of the term, one that would also include the manufacture of flu vaccines.\n\nIn one email between Morens to Daszak, Morens claimed Fauci was trying to protect EcoHealth. Morens also said information could be sent to Fauci through Fauci's personal email.\n\nFauci sought to distance himself from Morens, whose actions he condemned. Fauci said he was unaware of those actions and Morens' emails with Daszak. Fauci said Morens did not advise him \"on institute policy or other substantive issues.\"\n\nFauci said he has no recollection of ever conducting official business through personal email and insisted he never told Morens he would protect Daszak.\n\nThat did not stop Republicans on the committee from trying to link Fauci directly to wrongdoing.\n\n\"The office you directed, and those serving under your leadership, chose to flout the law and bragged about it,\" said Rep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, the panel's chair. \"Why did you allow your office to be unaccountable to the American people?\"\n\nAdded Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Va.: \" It is hard to believe that all of this occurred without your knowledge.\"\n\nDemocrats on the subcommittee accused their GOP colleagues of a politically motivated \"character assassination\" of Fauci to distract from former President Donald Trump's handling of the pandemic.\n\n\"They're treating you, Dr. Fauci, like a convicted felon. Actually, you probably wish they were treating you like a convicted felon. They treat convicted felons with love and admiration,\" said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a reference to Trump being found guilty last week in New York of falsifying business records.\n\nRuiz said the Republicans' investigation has produced no evidence supporting their claims against Fauci and accused GOP lawmakers of not being focused on conclusively determining the origin of COVID-19 so that the United States may prevent or be better prepared for a future pandemic.\n\n\"The Chinese Communist Party has blocked access to important information that could help confirm the origin of the virus,\" said Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla \"This committee should be doing more to fight for those answers, but instead has wasted significant time and taxpayer money fueling conspiracy theories and ignoring the importance of preparing for the next deadly pandemic.\"\n\nRepublicans continued to suggest Fauci suppressed the lab-leak theory.\n\nRep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., asked Fauci why he previously referred to the possibility of a lab leak as a \"distortion of reality\" and \"conspiracy theories.\"\n\nFauci said he never dismissed the lab-leak theory as a whole, only some of the context that some were using to support it.\n\n\"Like it was a lab leak and I was parachuted into the CIA like Jason Bourne and told the CIA that they should really not be talking about a lab leak,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

In the lengthy interview, Fauci admitted that he was unaware of any scientific studies demonstrating that masking for children worked or that the 6-foot social distancing guidelines -- which effectively shut down schools, churches, and businesses -- were an effective way of curbing the spread of the coronavirus. Fauci also acknowledged that the lab leak theory was not a conspiracy theory as he previously suggested.\n\nFauci, who plays a starring role in BlazeTV's \"The Coverup,\" appeared before the committee Monday to speak to these admissions as well as to his role in overseeing the funding of deadly gain-of-function experiments.\n\n''Because I said so.' That's never been good enough for Americans and it never will be.'\n\nCommittee Chairman Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio) told Fauci at the outset, \"Whether intentional or not, you became so powerful that any disagreements the public had with you were forbidden and censored on social and most legacy media time and time again. That is why so many Americans became so angry -- because this was fundamentally un-American.\"\n\n\"'Because I said so.' That's never been good enough for Americans and it never will be,\" added Wenstrup. \"Americans do not want to be indoctrinated. They want to be educated.\"\n\nThe hearing had the potential to be educational; however, Democratic committee members opted for the latter, celebrating Fauci, defending his preferred narratives, and lobbing attacks on their political opponents.\n\nRepublican lawmakers, alternatively, attempted to hold Fauci's feet to a low-heat fire, largely failing to get results.\n\nWhat follows are five key takeaways from the Fauci hearing.\n\nWhen asked straight out by Wenstrup whether the vaccine \"stopped transmission of the virus,\" Fauci answered, \"That is a complicated issue because in the beginning, the first iteration of the vaccines did have an effect -- not 100%, not a high effect -- they did prevent infection and subsequently, obviously transmission.\"\n\n'I feel extreme confidence in the safety and the efficacy of this vaccine.'\n\n\"However, it's important to point out something that we did not know early on that became evident as the months went by is that the durability of protection against infection and hence transmission was relatively limited whereas the duration of protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death was more prolonged,\" said Fauci. \"In the beginning it was felt that in fact it did prevent infection and thus transmission.\"\n\nAfter discovering Fauci would not disavow any of the draconian COVID measures he championed during the pandemic, Rep. Michael Cloud (R-Texas) also asked Fauci about his support for vaccine mandates and the efficacy of vaccines.\n\nFauci reiterated, \"It clearly prevented infection in a certain percentage of people, but the durability of its ability to prevent infection was not long.\"\n\nFauci was one of the most visible and consistent exponents of the \"safe and effective\" mantra, having claimed in December 2020, \"I feel extreme confidence in the safety and the efficacy of this vaccine and I want to encourage everyone who has the opportunity to get vaccinated so that we can have a veil of protection over this country, that would end this pandemic.\"\n\nWhereas Republican members blasted the former NIAID director for funding dangerous experiments of the kind that may have kicked off the pandemic as well as his years-long promotion of falsehoods, Democrats painted Fauci as a blameless victim and seized on the opportunity, as Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) did, to attack former President Donald Trump and other Republicans.\n\nRep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) told Fauci, \"You're human, just like the rest of us,\" and stressed that he \"deserve[s] better.\"\n\n\"I've seen your commitment not just to science, but to, again, to the greater good,\" said Dingell.\n\n'You have been a hero to many for 54 years.'\n\nAfter singing Fauci's praises, Dingell gave Fauci an opportunity to complain about facing criticism and perceived threats.\n\nDemocratic Reps. Dingell, Robert Garcia (Calif.), Jill Tokuda (Hawaii), Katherine Castor (Fla.), Raul Ruiz (Calif.), and Kweisi Mfume (Md.) similarly engaged in hagiography.\n\n\"We owe you an apology for the way we have dragged you through the mud,\" said Mfume.\n\n\"You have been a hero to many for 54 years,\" continued Mfume. \"You are a world-renowned scientist and an American patriot.\"\n\nMfume made no mention of Americans who have suffered vaccine injuries but instead spoke in the abstract of \"thousands of American lives [that] could have been spared\" if they had not followed so-called conspiracy theories during the pandemic.\n\nAfter paying his respects to Fauci, Rep. Garcia asked whether the \"American public should listen to America's brightest and best doctors and scientists, or instead listen to podcasters, conspiracy theorists, and unhinged Facebook memes.\"\n\n\"Listening to the people just described is going to do nothing but harm people because they will deprive themselves of life-saving interventions,\" said Fauci, who was among the so-called experts who cautioned against using ivermectin to fight COVID-19.\n\nFauci proceeded to accuse the unvaccinated of getting an estimated 200,000-300,000 killed in the U.S. alone.\n\nOversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) noted that there is \"a troubling pattern of behavior\" in Fauci's \"inner circle,\" naming Fauci's David M. Morens, senior scientific adviser to the head of the NIAID, and Fauci's former chief of staff as two offenders.\n\nComer pressed Fauci on whether Morens violated NIH policy by using a personal email for official purposes. Fauci appeared more than willing to throw his former adviser and frequent correspondent under the bus, indicating Morens' personal email use to avoid transparency was indeed in violation of agency policy.\n\n\"Does it violate NIAID policy to delete records to intentionally avoid FOIA?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Fauci.\n\n'That was wrong and inappropriate and violated policy.'\n\n\"On April 28, 2020, Dr. Morens edited an EcoHealth press release regarding the grant termination. Does that violate policy?\" asked Comer.\n\n\"That was inappropriate for him to be doing that for a grantee as a conflict of interest, among other things,\" said Fauci.\n\n\"On March 29, 2021, Dr. Morens edited a letter that Dr. Daszak was sending to NIH. Does that violate policy?\" asked Comer.\n\n\"Yes, it does,\" answered Fauci.\n\n\"On Oct. 25, 2021, Dr. Brady provided Dr. Daszak with advice regarding how to mislead NIH on EcoHealth's late progress report. Does that violate policy?\" asked Comer.\n\n\"That was wrong and inappropriate and violated policy,\" said Fauci.\n\n\"On Dec. 7, 2021, Dr. Morens wrote to the chair of EcoHealth board of directors to quote, 'Put in a word,' for Dr. Daszak. Does that violate policy?\" asked Comer.\n\n\"Should not have been done, and that was wrong,\" said Fauci. \"Well, I'm not sure of a specific policy, but I imagine that does violate policy. Should not have been doing that.\"\n\nRep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.) asked Fauci whether the National Institutes of Health funded gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\n'I would not characterize it as dangerous gain-of-function research.'\n\n\"I would not characterize it the way you did,\" said Fauci, contradicting the NIH's account. \"The National Institutes of Health, through a sub-award to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, funded research on the surveillance of and the possibility of emerging infections. I would not characterize it as dangerous gain-of-function research.\"\n\nElsewhere in his testimony Monday, Fauci said that \"according to the regulatory and operative definition of [Proposed Research Involving Enhanced Potential Pandemic Pathogens], the NIH did not fund gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\"\n\nLesko quoted NIH Principal Deputy Director Lawrence Tabak as acknowledging the \"failure of the Wuhan Institute of Virology to provide us with the data that we requested and the lab notebooks that we requested, [which] certainly impeded our ability to understand what was really going on with the experiments that we have been discussing.\"\n\nGranted the lack of transparency at the infamous lab, Lesko asked Fauci how he can be certain that the National Institutes of Health did not fund gain-of-function research on coronaviruses in China granted its subcontractor EcoHealth Alliance's reporting failures.\n\nFauci once again stressed that the NIH did not fund the deadly research in question, which EcoHealth Alliance's subcontractor specialized in.\n\nFauci claimed Monday that the idea he covered up a lab leak was \"preposterous.\"\n\nFauci indicated in his opening statement that he was informed on Jan. 31, 2020, \"through phone calls with Jeremy Farrar, then director of the Wellcome Trust in the U.K., and then with Christian Anderson, a highly regarded scientist at Scripps Research Institute, that they and Eddie Holmes, a world class evolutionary biologist from Australia, were concerned that the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that the virus could have been manipulated in a lab.\"\n\nFauci then noted he partook in a conference call the next day \"with about a dozen international virologists to discuss this possibility versus a spillover from an animal reservoir.\"\n\nDespite indications to the contrary, Fauci claimed, \"The accusation being circulated that I influenced these scientists to change their minds by bribing them with millions of dollars in grant money is absolutely false and simply preposterous. I had no input into the content of the published paper,\" referencing the March 2020 study published in the journal Nature, \"The Proximal Origins of SARS-CoV-2.\"\n\n\"The second issue is a false accusation that I tried to cover up the possibility that the virus originated from a lab. In fact, the truth is exactly the opposite,\" continued Fauci. \"I have repeatedly stated that I have a completely open mind to either possibility and that if definitive evidence becomes available to validate or refute either theory, I will readily accept it.\"\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) later asked Fauci whether he downplayed the lab leak theory on account of having funded experimental viruses at the Wuhan lab -- funding Fauci copped to but Ranking Member Raul Ruiz nevertheless cast doubt on in his closing remarks.\n\nFauci, prickled by the suggestion that he tried to downplay the possibility he had fingerprints on research that got millions of Americans killed, answered in the negative.", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

It marks the first time he's publicly testified since he left the federal government at the end of 2022 after five decades of service.\n\nFauci's appearance on Capitol Hill comes amid a contentious election cycle, with Republicans continuing to hammer him on his response to the virus -- everything from mask mandates to vaccine guidelines and origin possibilities.\n\n\"Americans were aggressively bullied, shamed and silenced for merely questioning or debating issues such as social distancing, masks, vaccines or the origins of COVID,\" chairman Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, said as the hearing kicked off.\n\nFauci addressed those issues, and Republican attacks, in his opening statement, calling certain issues \"seriously distorted.\"\n\nDemocrats on the panel, coming to Fauci's defense, announced earlier Monday the release of a staff report \"debunking point by point Republicans' dangerous narrative\" regarding the nation's former top infectious disease expert.\n\n\"After 15 months, the select subcommittee does not possess a shred of evidence to substantiate these extreme allegations Republicans have levied against Dr. Fauci for nearly 4 years,\" Democratic Rep. Raul Ruiz, the ranking member of the panel, said in his opening statement.\n\nThe latest attack on Fauci comes from Republicans on the subcommittee who cite \"new evidence\" they say warrants further scrutiny: an email exchange between a former Fauci senior adviser and an executive of a virus research organization where the adviser claims Fauci's private Gmail account could be utilized to evade Freedom of Information Act and future public scrutiny. Ahead of the hearing, Republicans requested access to Fauci's personal email account and cellphone records.\n\nFauci, in his opening statement, denied suggestions he used his private email: \"Let me state for the record that to the best of my knowledge I have never conducted official business via my personal email.\"\n\nDr. David Morens, the Fauci aide, advised EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak that Fauci may accept printed copies of documents if Daszak didn't want them tracked for the public record -- although it's not clear if Fauci ever had any involvement.\n\nRecords show that Morens himself used his private Gmail account to shield information from FOIA's reach, including to send Daszak official government documents and a heads-up about information that would become public through a FOIA request pertaining to EcoHealth Alliance grant materials and COVID-19 research.\n\nEcoHealth Alliance is a U.S.-based organization -- described as a \"virus-hunting group\" -- that conducts research and outreach programs and global health, conservation and international development, according to its website.\n\nRepublicans say the alliance facilitated gain-of-function research in Wuhan, China, without proper oversight; willingly violated multiple requirements of its multi-million dollar National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant; and, apparently, made false statements to the NIH.\n\nThe House select subcommittee released a report alleging wrongdoing there and the formal debarment of EcoHealth and Daszak. Health and Human Services has subsequently suspended U.S. funding to the organization, which totaled about $2.6 million last year.\n\nMorens testified behind closed doors for transcribed interviews before the subcommittee on Jan 18., and later produced an additional 30,000 pages of documents pursuant to a subpoena before testifying publicly on May 22.\n\nThe panel subsequently released a staff memorandum it argues \"presents overwhelming evidence\" from Morens's email revealing misconduct and potentially illegal actions. The memo included previously unreleased emails, obtained by subpoena, that Republicans believe incriminates Morens by showing he undermined the operations of the U.S. government, unlawfully deleted federal COVID-19 records and used personal email to avoid FOIA.\n\nConsidering Morens was a close adviser to Fauci, Republicans on the subcommittee expressed concern that Fauci had knowledge of his conduct and questioned whether Fauci potentially engaged in any misconduct himself.\n\nFauci told lawmakers on Monday he \"knew nothing\" of Morens' actions with Daszak or EcoHealth, and asserted Morens was not \"an adviser to me on institute policy or other substantive issues.\"\n\nThe request pertaining to Fauci's personal records specifies that the subcommittee is seeking access to all documents and communications related to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, EcoHealth, and the origins of COVID-19 retained in Dr. Fauci's personal email and cellphone records.\n\nFauci previously sat for closed-door, transcribed interviews with the panel for 14 hours on Jan. 8 and 9 -- before the latest records from Morens were combed through by the panel.\n\nFauci served as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, serving as a scientific check to Trump during the pandemic and later as President Joe Biden's chief medical advisor before retiring in 2022.\n\nFauci, 83, is set to publish his memoir, entitled \"ON CALL: A Doctor's Journey in Public Service,\" on June 18.

Republicans have grown increasingly critical of Fauci for his handling of the pandemic, accusing him of misleading the American people over the risks of COVID-19 and other issues.\n\nFauci appeared on Capitol Hill in January to testify behind closed doors to members of the select subcommittee on the COVID-19 pandemic. The Committee on Oversight and Accountability, which oversees the subcommittee's work, released transcripts of Fauci's testimony on Friday. Fauci is expected to return to Capitol Hill on Monday to testify publicly in front of Congress.\n\nOne line of questioning from the Republican counsel focused on the six-foot social distancing standard. Fauci was asked where the standard - which was pushed by federal, state, and local officials to slow the spread of COVID-19 - originated. The former federal health official suggested that the standard was arbitrary without a hard basis in data.\n\n\"You know, I don't recall. It sort of just appeared,\" Fauci said in response to the guideline's origins. \"I don't recall, like, a discussion of whether it should be 5 or 6 or whatever.\"\n\nIn response to a question if Fauci had seen any studies supporting the six-foot standard, Fauci responded in the negative.\n\n\"I was not aware of studies that in fact, that would be a very difficult study to do,\" Fauci said.\n\nAlso in his testimony, the GOP counsel asked Fauci if he had seen evidence to support the masking of children while such policies were being implemented across the U.S. and encouraged by health officials.\n\n\"You know, I might have, Mitch, but I don't recall specifically that I did. I might have,\" Fauci responded.\n\nThe U.S. response to COVID-19 has grown increasingly controversial, especially as it related to children and education. The length of school closures seemed to correlate with subsequent drops in test scores, according to data analyzed by The New York Times earlier this year.\n\n\"There's fairly good consensus that, in general, as a society, we probably kept kids out of school longer than we should have,\" pediatric disease specialist Sean O'Leary told the Times.", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Aside from questions about his handling of the coronavirus, lawmakers also plan to scrutinize the origin of the virus.\n\nPrior to the scheduled hearing, House Republicans have obtained information, which they claim leads to suspicion as to whether Fauci tried to keep a number of records from the public. They requested access to the cellphone records and personal email account of the former top infectious disease expert.\n\nABC News reported that Fauci previously stated that there was nothing that he was hiding and that he will be facing the House panel voluntarily. Fauci's appearance will be the first time that he will be testifying in public after leaving the government in 2022.\n\nRepublican members on the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic have spent more than a year looking for evidence against Fauci, checking Slack messages, emails, and even research proposals. But even after more than 100 hours of past closed-door testimony, the panel was not able to find anything linking Fauci to the beginnings of the Covid-19 outbreak in China, New York Times reported.\n\nHowever, the report says the panel had obtained emails that suggested that health officials working with Fauci had tried to evade public records laws at the medical research agency that Fauci ran for almost four decades.\n\nAt the hearing, Fauci will address questions concerning the agency's record-keeping practices. Fauci testifying will also be considered by Republicans on the committee as an apex of their long campaign against the scientists whom they viewed as having helped create the Covid pandemic.\n\nOver the past year, there were already hearings on the subject, but there was no new evidence that pointed to the pandemic having emerged from a lab.\n\nDemocrats warned about the subcommittee's work as \"an effort to weaponize concerns about a lab-related origin to fuel sentiment against our nation's scientists and public health officials for partisan gain.\"\n\nFauci has spent more than five decades in the government and has been advising presidents of both the Democrats and Republicans on infectious disease outbreaks. During the pandemic, he openly corrected false notions of former president Donald Trump about the coronavirus, and he actually appealed to the latter's critics.\n\nNow, the Republicans on the Select Subcommittee cite the existence of alleged \"new evidence,\" which warrants a perusal.

In fact, the truth is exactly the opposite.\"\n\nHe then read an email encouraging scientists to report their data to authorities.\n\nCalifornia Rep.

He also claimed not to recall if he ever sent any messages to Dr. Fauci's personal email account.\n\n\"I don't remember if I did,\" Dr. Morens said. \"I may have, but I certainly told him some things that he asked me to tell him about the situation with Peter.\"\n\nMany of the emails were sent to Peter Daszak, the head of the EcoHealth Alliance organization, which funneled money from the NIAID to a laboratory in Wuhan, China. Some of the money funded experiments that made a bat coronavirus more dangerous.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration has suspended funding to the lab, EcoHealth, and Mr. Daszak over their failure to produce records on the experiments.\n\nRep. Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio), chairman of the subcommittee, asked Dr. Fauci on May 29 for all documents and communications from his personal email and cellphone related to the lab and related subjects.\n\nDr. Fauci said in a prepared opening statement that he knew nothing about Dr. Morens deleting emails or assisting Mr. Daszak.\n\nHe said that \"despite his title, Dr. Morens was not an adviser to me on institute policy or other substantive issues.\" Dr. Fauci also said that he's \"never conducted official business via my personal email.\"\n\nIn other emails obtained by the subcommittee, another top aide to Dr. Fauci used strange letter substitutions.\n\nIn one missive about Kristian Andersen, an outside scientist, Dr. Fauci's aide Greg Folkers wrote \"anders$n.\" In a missive about EcoHealth, he wrote \"Ec~Health.\"\n\n\"This evasion tactic ensures that when the NIH searches its email server for keywords that are responsive to a FOIA request, Mr. Folkers's emails that contain the misspelled keyword are not identified or produced as a responsive document,\" Mr. Wenstrup said.\n\nSearches in response to FOIA requests are typically based on keywords.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Morens, and other top officials in the National Institutes of Health, the parent agency of NIAID, advocated for the theory that COVID-19 came from nature, as opposed to the Wuhan lab.\n\nMr. Andersen is among the outside scientists who favor the theory. He co-wrote a paper that claimed COVID-19 definitely has a natural origin. The paper was \"prompted\" by Dr. Fauci, according to one of Mr. Andersen's emails that was obtained by the subcommittee.\n\nMr. Andersen and other co-authors received millions of dollars in new funding from NIAID after the paper was published, records show.\n\nMr. Folkers has not responded to a request for comment.\n\nDr. Fauci said in his opening statement that accusations that he bribed Mr. Andersen and others with grant money are \"preposterous.\"\n\nDr. Fauci will also face questions about the testimony he delivered to the subcommittee behind closed doors in January.\n\nAccording to a transcript disclosed on May 31, Dr. Fauci said he signed off on thousands of grants without reading any of them.\n\nHe also maintained that the Wuhan lab did not perform any gain-of-function experiments, or experiments to enhance a virus, despite two other government officials recently telling the subcommittee the testing did meet the definition of gain-of-function.\n\nDr. Fauci also said he did not know of any studies to support the 6-foot social distancing measures imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), a member of the subcommittee, noted on social media platform X.\n\nThe social distancing \"just sort of appeared,\" Dr. Fauci said.\n\nRep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.), another member of the subcommittee, added, \"From arbitrary mandates, to suppressing the origins of COVID, to signing off on funds that ended up in a Communist China lab & horrific experiments on innocent animals, we have lots of questions to ask Dr. Fauci on Monday.\"\n\nRep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.), though, signaled that Democrats may still hold the position that criticism of Dr. Fauci amounts to attacks against him.\n\n\"House Republicans will spend tomorrow's hearing attacking science, vaccines, and Dr. Fauci,\" he wrote on Sunday. \"But those of us on the committee are prepared to push back on their lies.

It sort of just appeared,' he said according to committee transcripts when pressed on how the rule came about.\n\nHe added he 'was not aware of studies' that supported the social distancing, conceding that such studies 'would be very difficult' to do.\n\nIn addition to not recalling any evidence supporting social distancing, Fauci also told the committee's counsel that he didn't remember reading anything to support that masking kids would prevent COVID.\n\n'Do you recall reviewing any studies or data supporting masking for children?' he was asked.\n\n'I don't recall,' Dr. Anthony Fauci told the committee when pressed on where the six foot social distancing rule came from 'It sort of just appeared.'\n\nWhen pressed on the forced masking of kids, Fauci could not recall if he read anything to support the fact it would prevent illness\n\n'I might have,' he responded before adding 'but I don't recall specifically that I did.'\n\nThe pandemic patriarch also testified that he had not followed any studies after the fact regarding the impacts that forced mask wearing had on children, of which there have been many.\n\nAnd his answer was an ironic COVID-esque pun, 'I still think that's up in the air,' Fauci said about whether masking kids was a solid way to prevent transmission.\n\nFurther, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) told the counsel that he believes the lab leak theory - the idea that COVID began at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) - is a real 'possibility.'\n\n'I think people have made conspiracy aspects from it,' he said, adding 'it could be a lab leak.'\n\n'So I think that in and of itself isn't inherently a conspiracy theory, but some people spin off things from that that are kind of crazy.'\n\nHis admission that COVID may have began at the WIV comes four years after he backed the publication of a paper which threw cold water on the lab leak theory called the 'Proximal Origin' paper.\n\nThe former NIAID director gave the committee a suspect answer of whether he was conducting gain-of-function research\n\nThe former NIAID director said the lab leak theory could be true\n\nThe coronavirus committee has dedicated months to discovering the origins of the virus that upended so many lives and resulted in the deaths of 6 million people globally.\n\nRecently they have discovered that Fauci's former top aide, Dr. David Morens, routinely conducted work on his personal email account and deleted files to avoid government transparency laws under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).\n\nHis disregard for FOIA requests was so blatant that be bragged in emails to colleagues that he learned how to make official correspondence 'disappear' and that he would delete things he didn't 'want to see in the New York Times.'\n\nEmails from Morens uncovered by the committee further revealed that he boasted about having a 'secret back channel' to Fauci where he could clandestinely communicate with the former NIAID director.\n\nThat revelation shocked the committee's chairman Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, so thoroughly that he demanded Fauci turnover his personal email and phone records to the investigative body.\n\nAlso shocking, is Fauci's admission to the committee in January that he 'never' looks at the grants that he signed off on, some of which total to millions of taxpayer dollars.\n\n'You know, technically, I sign off on each council, but I don't see the grants and what they are. I never look at what grants are there,' he told the committee's counsel.\n\nFurther, he said he was 'not certain' that foreign labs that receive U.S. grant money, such as the WIV - which was studying coronaviruses using U.S. taxpayer dollars at the time the pandemic began - operate at the same standards of American labs.\n\nFauci also said that the money he gave out as a part of the NIAID grant process did not go through any national security reviews.\n\nFauci's former top aide, Dr. David Morens, speaks during a House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic hearing on Capitol Hill on May 22\n\nFauci said the money he awards to labs abroad is not reviewed for national security concerns\n\nAdditionally, the former director said he was unaware of any conflicts of interest among his staff, which included his senior advisor Dr. Morens.\n\nHowever, Morens testified before the committee on May 22 that he helped his 'best friend' EcoHealth Alliance President Dr. Peter Daszak with his nonprofit's work.\n\nMorens said he helped edit press releases for EcoHealth and worked to restore grant funding for the nonprofit after it's funding was terminated in the wake of the COVID outbreak in 2020.\n\nNIH, which employs Morens, funded Daszak's EcoHealth to the tune of millions of dollars.\n\nStill, Fauci said he was unaware that Morens had any conflicts of interests.\n\nThe committee will surely seek to clarify Fauci and Moren's 'secret back channel' of communication during the June 3 hearing.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social distancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Do the American people deserve to be abused like that, Mr. Fauci, because you're not Dr., you're Mr. Fauci in my few minutes,\" she said, before adding \"No, I don't need your answer.\"\n\nShe was pressing him on schools requiring children to wear masks during the pandemic and the six-feet social distancing guidelines put in place in many public spaces to reduce the spread of COVID-19.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) quickly objected, asking, \"Just in terms of the rules of decorum, are we allowed to deny that a doctor is a doctor just because we don't want him to be a doctor?\"\n\n\"Yes, because in my time, that man does not deserve to have a license. As a matter of fact, it should be revoked and he belongs in jail,\" Greene responded.\n\nWenstrup then reprimanded Greene, saying loudly that \"The gentlelady will suspend\" and instructed her to recognize Fauci as a doctor.\n\nRep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) also said that it was \"unacceptable\" for Greene to not address Fauci with the appropriate title.\n\n\"It's completely unacceptable to deny Dr. Fauci who's here, a respected member of the medical community, his title. And that's actually a personal attack on his character,\" he said.\n\nThis prompted Greene to say that Fauci was \"not respected\" and to double down on not addressing Fauci as doctor. Wenstrup then urged all members of the committee to adhere to the rules of decorum and to be \"mindful of their remarks.\"\n\nGreene concluded her questioning by calling for a criminal referral against Fauci for \"crimes against humanity.\"\n\n\"You know what this committee should be doing? We should be recommending you to be prosecuted. We should be writing a criminal referral because you should be prosecuted for crimes against humanity.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) refused to address Fauci as a doctor, refused to allow him to answer questions, and said the veteran civil servant deserves to be in prison.\n\n\"Mr. Fauci, because you're not Doctor [Fauci], you're Mr. Fauci in my few minutes,\" Greene said.\n\nAfter Ranking Member Jamie Raskin (D-Mass.) raised a point of order, arguing Greene's refusal to address Dr. Fauci by his title constituted a violation of the committee's rules, the Georgia congresswoman said Fauci \"does not deserve to have a license. As a matter of fact it should be revoked and he belongs in prison.\"\n\nOversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) then ordered Greene to suspend and to refer to Fauci according to his appropriate title. The verbal back and forth came just weeks after Greene derailed an Oversight Committee hearing by attacking the appearance of another congresswoman.\n\nRep. Robert Garcia (D-Fla.) apologized to Fauci on behalf of Democrats on the committee for Greene's antics. \"This might be the most insane hearing I've attended,\" Garcia said, pointing out that both his mother, a health care worker, and his stepfather died of Covid-19. \"I lost both of my parents during the pandemic, so I take this very personally, especially when other members of this body - who are tasked to be responsible and actually help the American people -- attack medical professionals like you,\" he said.\n\nIn his own remarks to the committee, Raskin called out Republican's hostility towards Fauci. \"They are treating you like a convicted felon. Actually, you probably wish they were treating you like a convicted felon,\" Raskin said. \"They treat convicted felons with love and admiration. Some of them blindly worship convicted felons,\" he added, noting the sycophantic ire with which Greene and other Republican lawmakers reacted to the criminal conviction of former President Donald Trump last week.\n\nWhenever Fauci was actually allowed to respond to questions from Republican lawmakers, he took the opportunity to push back on many of the conspiracies about his role in the pandemic.\n\nWhen asked if he received any royalties from Big Pharma since 2021, Fauci responded that he's made \"zero\" dollars in pandemic royalties. \"I got $122 for a monoclonal antibody I created 27 years ago,\" Fauci added, clarifying that the decades-old research was unrelated to the pandemic.\n\nRep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.) attempted to press Fauci over claims that Covid-19 originated from a research laboratory, or the so-called \"lab leak\" theory.\n\n\"I don't think the concept of there being a lab leak is inherently a conspiracy theory,\" Fauci responded. \"What is conspiracy is the kind of distortions of that particular subject, like it was a lab leak and I was parachuted into the CIA like Jason Bourne and told the CIA they shouldn't be talking about a lab leak.\"\n\nFauci also addressed continued concerns about his safety given the slew of conspiracies pushed by prominent Republicans about his involvement in the pandemic response.\n\n\"Do you continue to get threats today?\" Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) asked.\n\n\"I do,\" Fauci responded. \"Every time somebody gets up and says I'm responsible for the deaths of people throughout the world.\"", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nikki_mccann_ramirez@rollingstone.com", "name": "Nikki McCann Ramirez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

I don't recall, like, a discussion of whether it should be 5 or 6 or whatever. It was just that 6-foot is -- \"\n\n\"Did you see any studies that supported 6 feet?\" he was then asked, according to the transcript.\n\n\"I was not aware of studies that -- in fact, that would be a very difficult study to do,\" Fauci said.\n\nFauci was similarly uncertain about the justification for masking children.\n\n\"Do you recall reviewing any studies or data supporting masking for children?\" he was asked.\n\n\"You know, I might have, Mitch, but I don't recall specifically that I did,\" Fauci told him. \"I might have.\"\n\n\"Since the -- there's been a lot of studies that have come out since the pandemic started, but specifically on this, there have been significant on kind of like the learning loss and speech and development issues that have been associated with particularly young children wearing masks while they're growing up.

He participated in daily hearings alongside then-President Donald Trump and resumed his role when President Joe Biden took office.\n\nAlthough he retired from the NIAID in December 2022, Fauci has routinely been a source of controversy among conservatives, including members of Congress -- many of whom have questioned his motives and those of other officials in scientific and government capacities. He has also been maligned for theories that the virus did not emanate from a Wuhan lab, though the origins of the virus remain a question more than four years since lockdowns and other safety measures took hold.\n\nGreene's five minutes of time included her immediately admonishing Fauci multiple times, holding up photos and various news outlet headlines hammering his reputation.\n\nShe questioned COVID-era rules and how much he has earned from pharmaceutical companies.\n\n\"Do you think that's appropriate? Do the American people deserve to be abused like that, Mr. Fauci?\" Greene asked Fauci. \"Because you're not a doctor, you're Mr. Fauci in my few minutes.\"\n\nAs he was about to answer, Greene interrupted, saying, \"I don't need your answer.\"\n\nThe questioning from Greene was interrupted multiple times by objections by Democratic members of the subcommittee, issuing \"points of order\" based on Greene's statements.\n\nAfter one objection, Greene said that Fauci \"does not deserve to have a license.\"\n\nGreene added: \"You know what this committee should be doing? We should be recommending you to be prosecuted. We should be writing a criminal referral because you should be prosecuted for crimes against humanity. You belong in prison, Dr. Fauci.\"\n\nGreene at another point held up a photo of dogs and asked if testing on canines was part of the scientific method, to which Fauci responded with a quizzical look and asked what that had to do with COVID.\n\nShe never went into detail about the background of such purported experiments allegedly paid for by taxpayers.\n\nA spokesperson for Greene told Newsweek that Greene's words speak for herself.\n\nShe also showed a photo of Fauci at a Washington Nationals baseball game, noting that he was sitting near others without a mask and not adhering to six feet of distance as was encouraged by guidance.\n\nDemocratic Representative Robert Garcia spoke after Greene, defending Fauci while chastising his Republican counterpart.\n\n\"Totally insane that Marjorie Taylor Greene would not refer to Dr. Fauci as a doctor,\" Garcia wrote on X. \"He's one of the most brilliant medical minds in the country. She's a national embarrassment.\"\n\nFauci continued to face grilling by members of the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic into the afternoon.\n\nRepublican Committee Chairman Brad Wenstrup said in April that Fauci's retirement from public service \"does not excuse Dr. Fauci from accountability to the American people.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_mordowanec@newsweek.com", "name": "Nick Mordowanec", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Monday's hearing is his first public appearance since his retirement.\n\nHere are the top three things to watch for during the hearing:\n\nFauci is likely to be asked extensively about the work of his senior adviser, David Morens, who utilized his personal email address for government business related to the origins of COVID-19 to avoid Freedom of Information Act requests.\n\nMorens had a close personal relationship with Peter Daszak of EcoHealth Alliance, a subgrant awardee from the National Institutes of Health that used federal funds to conduct bat coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China.\n\nMorens corresponded with Daszak extensively via Gmail when EcoHealth's grant was terminated by the Trump administration in 2020, aiding in its eventual reinstatement. Fauci's senior adviser also gave Daszak sensitive information about FOIA requests for the grant.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has begun debarment proceedings against EcoHealth and Daszak personally after that step was deemed \"necessary to protect the public interest.\"\n\nSubpoenaed email communications from Morens to Daszak reveal that Morens may have discussed the grant and sensitive information regarding the origins of COVID-19 with Fauci via a Zoom call to avoid FOIA searches.\n\n\"We are getting FOIA'd non stop,\" Morens wrote to Daszak in April 2021. \"So it's most important that Tony not have anything on the record that could come back to bite.\"\n\nMask mandate policies and social distancing are likely to divide subcommittee members along partisan lines.\n\nDuring Fauci's transcribed interview with the subcommittee in January, the leading infectious disease expert said the science on mask mandates is \"still up in the air.\"\n\nFauci insisted in the transcribed interview that he \"didn't flip-flop\" on his masking position but rather that his position changed as more was learned about the virus.\n\nDuring the early stage of the pandemic, Fauci said there \"was not any good evidence that outside of the hospital setting that a mask is effective in preventing the acquisition or transmissibility.\"\n\nHowever, this changed, according to Fauci, over the long term, and even tattered cloth masks offered \"some protection\" compared to no masks at all, although they offered less protection than KN95 or N95 respirator masks.\n\nFauci also told the subcommittee that he did not have any scientific evidence for the precise number of 6 feet for social distancing during the early stages of the pandemic.\n\n\"It just sort of appeared,\" Fauci said in his interview. \"I don't recall, like, a discussion of whether it should be 5 or 6 or whatever.\"\n\nFauci's endorsement of the COVID-19 vaccines will likely be a flashpoint for the subcommittee hearing.\n\nSeveral members of the subcommittee, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), have denounced the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines for their various side effects, including rare cases of myocarditis and blood clots.\n\nFauci was asked by the subcommittee in his transcribed interview about his statement in May 2021 that the vaccine makes the patient \"a dead end to the virus\" and that the vaccine was essential to preventing community spread.\n\nThe infectious disease expert defended his statements by saying they were accurate at the time he made the remarks but became less accurate over time as the virus mutated.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"Right now, vaccines do not necessarily protect very well at all against infection,\" Fauci said in January. \"But the ability to protect you from getting into the hospital is still pretty strong.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gabrielle_m_etzel@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Gabrielle M.

It appeared he did not deliver them as they were submitted to the committee.\n\n'Their study, therefore, could not and did not constitute GoF research,' it continued.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci testifies before Congress on the COVID pandemic on June 3\n\nFauci also sought to distance himself from his now-disgraced former top aide, Dr. David Morens, who conspired to cover-up emails from federal transparency laws.\n\nMorens testified before the body previously that he helped coronavirus researcher Dr. Peter Daszak, who had a direct financial interest in coronavirus research in Wuhan, edit press releases for the researcher's organization EcoHealth.\n\n'I knew nothing of Dr. Morens's actions regarding EcoHealth,' Fauci said.\n\nThe committee's chairman, Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, opened with a salvo calling into question Fauci's conduct during COVID.\n\n'Americans were aggressively bullied, shamed, and silenced for merely questioning or debating issues such as social distancing, masks, vaccines, or the origins of COVID,' he said.\n\n'You took the position that you presented 'the science' and your words came across as final and as infallible in matters pertaining to the pandemic.'\n\n'You were the highest paid person in the government. This makes you more accountable to the people, not less.'\n\n'To be successful, our federal public health institutions must be accountable to the people again.'\n\nPreviously, DailyMail.com revealed that Fauci previously testified before the body that he was not sure where the six-foot social distancing rules came from, telling committee lawyers that rule 'sort of just appeared.'\n\nHe also told the counsel that he did not remember reading any studies that supported the notion that masks were effective for children.\n\nSpeaking to counsel on behalf of the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic earlier this year, Fauci told Republicans that the six foot social distancing rule 'sort of just appeared' and that he did not recall how it came about.\n\n'You know, I don't recall. It sort of just appeared,' he said according to committee transcripts when pressed on how the rule came about.\n\nHe added he 'was not aware of studies' that supported the social distancing, conceding that such studies 'would be very difficult' to do.\n\nIn addition to not recalling any evidence supporting social distancing, Fauci also told the committee's counsel that he didn't remember reading anything to support that masking kids would prevent COVID.\n\n'Do you recall reviewing any studies or data supporting masking for children?' he was asked.\n\n'I don't recall,' Dr. Anthony Fauci told the committee when pressed on where the six foot social distancing rule came from 'It sort of just appeared.'\n\nWhen pressed on the forced masking of kids, Fauci could not recall if he read anything to support the fact it would prevent illness\n\n'I might have,' he responded before adding 'but I don't recall specifically that I did.'\n\nThe pandemic patriarch also testified that he had not followed any studies after the fact regarding the impacts that forced mask wearing had on children, of which there have been many.\n\nAnd his answer was an ironic COVID-esque pun, 'I still think that's up in the air,' Fauci said about whether masking kids was a solid way to prevent transmission.\n\nFurther, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) told the counsel that he believes the lab leak theory - the idea that COVID began at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) - is a real 'possibility.'\n\n'I think people have made conspiracy aspects from it,' he said, adding 'it could be a lab leak.'\n\n'So I think that in and of itself isn't inherently a conspiracy theory, but some people spin off things from that that are kind of crazy.'\n\nHis admission that COVID may have began at the WIV comes four years after he backed the publication of a paper which threw cold water on the lab leak theory called the 'Proximal Origin' paper.\n\nThe former NIAID director gave the committee a suspect answer of whether he was conducting gain-of-function research\n\nThe former NIAID director said the lab leak theory could be true\n\nThe coronavirus committee has dedicated months to discovering the origins of the virus that upended so many lives and resulted in the deaths of 6 million people globally.\n\nRecently they have discovered that Fauci's former top aide, Dr. David Morens, routinely conducted work on his personal email account and deleted files to avoid government transparency laws under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).\n\nHis disregard for FOIA requests was so blatant that be bragged in emails to colleagues that he learned how to make official correspondence 'disappear' and that he would delete things he didn't 'want to see in the New York Times.'\n\nEmails from Morens uncovered by the committee further revealed that he boasted about having a 'secret back channel' to Fauci where he could clandestinely communicate with the former NIAID director.\n\nThat revelation shocked the committee's chairman Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, so thoroughly that he demanded Fauci turnover his personal email and phone records to the investigative body.\n\nAlso shocking, is Fauci's admission to the committee in January that he 'never' looks at the grants that he signed off on, some of which total to millions of taxpayer dollars.\n\n'You know, technically, I sign off on each council, but I don't see the grants and what they are.

He retired at the end of 2022 and has been the target of a number of accusations from mostly conservative members of the public that he participated in alleged cover-ups regarding the virus's origins. Most recently, Fauci faced criticism at the end of May after the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic reviewed more than 30,000 pages of subpoenaed emails and documents from Dr. David Morens, Fauci's former senior adviser.\n\nThe subcommittee, led by Republican Representative Brad Wenstrup, said the emails raised \"serious questions as to whether Dr. Fauci took part in a conspiracy amongst the highest levels of [the National Institutes of Health] to hide official records related to the origins of COVID-19.\"\n\nMorens has already testified before the subcommittee. Fauci's hearing is expected to last until 1 p.m. Newsweek reached out to Wenstrup's office by email for comment.\n\nIn a written testimony to the subcommittee, Fauci addressed several accusations made against him in the National Institutes of Health (NIH), including the \"disinformation\" that he tried to coerce scientists away from the belief that the virus could've been created in a lab and that an NIH-funded grant led to research that created the coronavirus.\n\nThe full testimony can be read below:\n\nAfter a lengthy introduction regarding his personal background Fauci summarizes a phone call between himself and \"about a dozen highly regarded virologists\" to discuss concerns that the virus had originated in a lab.\n\n\"Contrary to the disinformation circulated on social media and elsewhere that I tried to influence the discussion on that call away from a lab leak theory, two participants on that call have verified to this subcommittee that I did not try to steer the discussion in one direction versus another,\" Fauci wrote. \"I am not an evolutionary virologist and would not be qualified to do so in any case. I left the issue of the origin of the virus to the experts on the call.\"\n\nLater on, Fauci explains that several of the experts on the phone call who first thought the virus could've originated from a lab said there was \"no indication that the virus was manipulated and that the most likely scenario was that it emerged as a natural spillover from an animal reservoir, even though they kept an open mind.\"\n\nFauci went on to address the \"accusation\" alleging that he influenced the scientists to change their minds by bribing them with grant money.\n\n\"There is no way to answer this accusation except to say that it is preposterous,\" he said.\n\nFauci also addressed the \"insidious accusation\" that an NIH grant that allowed Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) scientists to conduct \"surveillance on human serology and bat viruses in the environment in China\" led to the creation of the virus that produced the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"Any qualified evolutionary virologist would confirm that the bat viruses that were studied at WIV under the NIH-funded grant were phylogenetically so far removed from SARS-CoV-2 that it would be molecularly impossible for those viruses to be turned into SARS-CoV-2,\" Fauci argued.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anna_skinner@newsweek.com", "name": "Anna Skinner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

The testimony comes as politicians and health agencies from around the world assess their response to the pandemic and the impact on their citizens and their economies.\n\nMembers of former President Donald Trump's Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement and other conservatives have seized on the previous testimony, saying there was a \"massive cover-up from the very beginning.\"\n\nSome areas that conservatives have focused on from Fauci's previous testimony include:\n\nThe amount of information revealed by Fauci's previous testimony ignited criticism from the right, even before his appearance before the committee this week.\n\nKentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul, who has repeatedly lashed out at Fauci, told Fox News on Sunday morning: \"There is a massive cover-up from the very beginning... but ultimately the buck stops with Anthony Fauci. He was in charge of the place and he has a responsibility; not only for the cover-up, but also a responsibility for letting dangerous research go on that in all likelihood led to a pandemic that killed millions of people.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to Paul via email for further comment.\n\nOn social media, a number of MAGA enthusiasts also blasted Fauci.\n\nOne commentator on X (formerly Twitter) Steven Miller, who describes himself as a \"patriot,\" wrote: \"Fauci is a criminal. Never forget the lies he told in the name of science.\"\n\nAnother popular right-wing X account under the user name End Wokeness shared a screengrab of some of Fauci's testimony about the requirement for children to wear masks. The X user's caption read: \"Under oath, Fauci admits that he forced our kids to wear masks for no reason. For this alone, he belongs behind bars. For life.\"\n\nOther online commentators replied to some of the backlash by defending Fauci.\n\n\"The claim that Fauci admitted to enforcing masks 'for no reason' is a blatant lie,\" the X user under the handle 4HumanUnity posted. \"Mask recommendations were based on the best available evidence to curb COVID-19 spread. Decisions evolved with the situation to protect public health. Evidence for children may have been limited, but recommendations were part of comprehensive strategies to reduce transmission. The call for Fauci's imprisonment is absurd and baseless. Public health decisions aimed to protect, not harm. Managing a pandemic requires nuanced understanding, not inflammatory rhetoric. Recommendations were made in good faith, backed by expert judgment and scientific evidence.\"\n\nAn opinion piece published on Monday by The Hill written by former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala, also supported Fauci. Shalala, who worked with Fauci for years, said: \"Dr. Fauci is one of America's most respected public servants and brilliant public health officials in the world [...] As happens with science, these public health officials relied upon evolving scientific data and committed their lives to reducing the threat of COVID-19 [...]\n\n\"Americans are devastated and frustrated about the loss of life and damage created by the pandemic.

He is expected to face grilling from Congressional Republicans over the origins of the virus as well as transparency around government agency communications and records.\n\nThe former head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is sitting for his first congressional testimony in almost two years.\n\nThe GOP-led subcommittee has requested access to Dr Fauci's personal email and phone records after obtaining information, which, they say, calls into question whether he may have attempted to conceal some records.\n\nDr Fauci is appearing voluntarily on Monday. He has said that he has \"nothing to hide.\"\n\nBrad Wenstrup, the chair of the subcommittee, began the hearing by saying, \"America cannot move forward without looking back.

He said he has been at the NIH for 54 years and was director of the NIAID for 38 years.\n\nHe addressed \"certain issues that have been seriously distorted concerning me,\" the infectious disease expert continued.\n\nHe first mentioned the lab leak theory. \"The accusation being circulated that I influenced these scientists to change their minds with millions of dollars in grant money is absolutely false and simply preposterous,\" Dr Fauci said.\n\nHe then addressed the accusations that he allegedly tried to \"cover up\" the possibility that the virus originated from a lab.\n\n\"The truth is exactly the opposite,\" he said matter-of-factly. He then read an email, adding, \"It is inconceivable that anvone who reads this e-mail could conclude that I was trying to 'cover up' the possibility ofa laboratory leak.

Four years later, more than 10 million Americans are still suffering from long COVID. We continue to fight for accountability.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, in his role as chief medical adviser to the president, insisted upon mask and vaccine mandates, lockdowns, and overstated vaccine efficacy, often disregarding the public's and private medical professional's ability to assess the facts.\n\nMany lessons must be learned from Dr. Fauci's tenure, highlighting the need for supervision and ethical leadership. As a physician, I believe in informing patients of the truth and collaborating on plans.\n\nThis week, he will testify before the House of Representatives. We must demand answers for the numerous unresolved issues related to his potential role in the origins of COVID-19, and the subsequent alleged cover-up. Here are several questions I hope are asked:\n\nDr. Fauci has advocated for and funded risky gain of function (GOF) research for more than 30 years. He was undoubtedly aware of the history of the engineering and structural problems, along with sloppy procedural issues, at the labs in Wuhan, China.\n\nRisky GOF Research: After learning of the possibility of a lab leak from respected scientists, did Dr. Fauci consult the appropriate government agencies at the National Biosurveillance Integration Center, National Center for Medical Intelligence, and Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, all stacked with experts about the risky research at the unsafe Wuhan Institute of Virology? Evidence indicates he consulted private sector scientists with significant conflicts of interest, as they depended on his research funds. Dr. Fauci has never conceded to seeking advice from the correct government channels, why?\n\nHe knew the Chinese military was involved in all research at Wuhan laboratories, including that China's military ran a bioweapons program at the Wuhan Institute of Virology labs. Yet, Dr. Fauci continued to use taxpayer money to fund the research projects in Wuhan, China.\n\nCaught in a Lie: Dr. Fauci previously testified before Congress that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) wasn't funding GOF research. Based on current information, Dr. Fauci has been caught in a lie and should answer for it. Not only has the NIH admitted to funding GOF research, they then changed the definition of GOF research to allow continued foreign research funding. What was Dr. Fauci's role in changing this definition to secure additional funding?\n\nContinuing Deadly Research at U.S. Taxpayers Expense: China locked us out of Wuhan after the novel coronavirus emerged and refused to share the DNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and other valuable information. Dr. Fauci must explain how America benefited from these grants to EcoHealth Alliance and other U.S.-funded GOF research conducted in foreign nations.\n\nOversight Within NIH Grant Process: Dr. Fauci must also be held accountable for overseeing the NIH grant process. We uncovered and sounded the alarm back in October of 2021 that EcoHealth Alliance was out of compliance with NIH grant policies and had not submitted its year-five report. Why did it continue to receive funding?\n\nWhen confronted about this, Dr. Fauci claimed ignorance, although it was his responsibility to ensure compliance with these grants. This lack of oversight highlights the immediate need for increased accountability at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the necessity for its own inspector general.\n\nWhen following the evidence, Dr. Fauci often sought counsel from questionable advisers and scientists with clear conflicts of interest.\n\nThe Federal Advisory Committee Act mandates that advice given to the federal government by advisory committees be objective, transparent, and publicly accessible. However, email records show that Dr. Fauci consulted his close network of private scientists, some of whom financially benefited from the NIH grants that Dr. Fauci oversees, and some in that group were waiting on a grant approval worth up to $9 million.\n\nThe Federal Advisory Committee Act: Why in February 2020 did Dr. Fauci hold closed advisory committee meetings with scientists who are dependent on his NIH funding, violating the Federal Advisers Committee Act's requirements for transparency and balanced viewpoints?\n\nImportantly, after that meeting, the Fauci-led group published the \"Proximal Origins\" theory, concluding that SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a \"natural virus.\" Once published, Dr. Fauci seemingly embarked on a mass media cover-up and touted that opinion piece that he orchestrated as scientific fact, even referencing it from the White House podium.\n\nProximal Origins Theory: Dr. Fauci should be asked why he presumably used his power to manipulate science and publish factually incorrect articles to downplay the lab leak theory. Why was Dr. Fauci directing articles in science journals and pushing his debunked proximal origins theory narrative? Was his involvement so deep that he was manufacturing and rewriting history to evade the responsibility and the role he had in this virus outbreak?\n\nBlocking FOIA Requests: It's also curious that after Dr. Fauci was questioned by our Senate HELP committee in May 2021, the Department of Health and Human Services shut down all Freedom of Information Act requests. Was Dr. Fauci involved in any discussions for this decision? Why was that decision made?\n\nMany people also don't know that Dr. Fauci received two government salaries simultaneously, making him the highest-paid federal employee ever. He was both the director of the NIAID and the director of civilian biodefense, which was operating with a $6 billion budget.\n\nHighest-Paid Federal Employee in History: Dr. Fauci should be asked to explain how the attribution of potential intentional pathogen deployment (which he was tasked to oversee and manage) is assessed and how the action plan is developed and implemented. If he can't adequately answer these questions when asked, he should return the salary and related pension immediately.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Comer asked during questioning.\n\nThe Dr. Morens issue that was discussed by this committee violates NIH policy, yes,\" Fauci said.\n\nDoes it violate NIAID policy to delete records to intentionally avoid FOIA?\" the representative asked.\n\nYes,\" Fauci said.\n\nWhen asked about Morens allegedly attempting to mislead the National Institute of Health, Fauci again admitted, \"that was wrong and inappropriate and violated policy.\"\n\nIn an opening statement to the subcommittee Monday, Rep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, condemned Fauci's position as an authority on the COVID-19 pandemic. Fauci's health mandates concerning masking and social distancing led to suppression of Americans who questioned their efficacy, the representative claimed.\n\nREAD MORE | Ohio Republican slams Fauci over pandemic policies: 'Americans were aggressively bullied'\n\n\"Americans were aggressively bullied, shamed and silenced for merely questioning or debating issues such as social distancing, masks, vaccines, or the origins of COVID,\" Rep.

It sort of just appeared,' he said according to committee transcripts when pressed on how the rule came about.\n\nHe added he 'was not aware of studies' that supported the social distancing, conceding that such studies 'would be very difficult' to do.\n\nIn addition to not recalling any evidence supporting social distancing, Fauci also told the committee's counsel that he didn't remember reading anything to support that masking kids would prevent COVID.\n\n'Do you recall reviewing any studies or data supporting masking for children?' he was asked.\n\n'I might have,' he responded before adding 'but I don't recall specifically that I did.'\n\nThe pandemic patriarch also testified that he had not followed any studies after the fact regarding the impacts that forced mask wearing had on children, of which there have been many.\n\nAnd his answer was an ironic COVID-esque pun, 'I still think that's up in the air,' Fauci said about whether masking kids was a solid way to prevent transmission.\n\nFurther, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) told the counsel that he believes the lab leak theory - the idea that COVID began at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) - is a real 'possibility.'\n\n'I think people have made conspiracy aspects from it,' he said, adding 'it could be a lab leak.'\n\n'So I think that in and of itself isn't inherently a conspiracy theory, but some people spin off things from that that are kind of crazy.'\n\nHis admission that COVID may have began at the WIV comes four years after he backed the publication of a paper which threw cold water on the lab leak theory called the 'Proximal Origin' paper.\n\nThe coronavirus committee has dedicated months to discovering the origins of the virus that upended so many lives and resulted in the deaths of 6 million people globally.\n\nRecently they have discovered that Fauci's former top aide, Dr. David Morens, routinely conducted work on his personal email account and deleted files to avoid government transparency laws under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).\n\nHis disregard for FOIA requests was so blatant that be bragged in emails to colleagues that he learned how to make official correspondence 'disappear' and that he would delete things he didn't 'want to see in the New York Times.'\n\nEmails from Morens uncovered by the committee further revealed that he boasted about having a 'secret back channel' to Fauci where he could clandestinely communicate with the former NIAID director.\n\nThat revelation shocked the committee's chairman Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, so thoroughly that he demanded Fauci turnover his personal email and phone records to the investigative body.\n\nAlso shocking, is Fauci's admission to the committee in January that he 'never' looks at the grants that he signed off on, some of which total to millions of taxpayer dollars.\n\n'You know, technically, I sign off on each council, but I don't see the grants and what they are. I never look at what grants are there,' he told the committee's counsel.\n\nFurther, he said he was 'not certain' that foreign labs that receive U.S. grant money, such as the WIV - which was studying coronaviruses using U.S. taxpayer dollars at the time the pandemic began - operate at the same standards of American labs.\n\nFauci also said that the money he gave out as a part of the NIAID grant process did not go through any national security reviews.\n\nAdditionally, the former director said he was unaware of any conflicts of interest among his staff, which included his senior advisor Dr. Morens.\n\nHowever, Morens testified before the committee on May 22 that he helped his 'best friend' EcoHealth Alliance President Dr. Peter Daszak with his nonprofit's work.\n\nMorens said he helped edit press releases for EcoHealth and worked to restore grant funding for the nonprofit after it's funding was terminated in the wake of the COVID outbreak in 2020.\n\nNIH, which employs Morens, funded Daszak's EcoHealth to the tune of millions of dollars.\n\nStill, Fauci said he was unaware that Morens had any conflicts of interests.\n\nThe committee will surely seek to clarify Fauci and Moren's 'secret back channel' of communication during the June 3 hearing.", "source": {"uri": "thepeoplesvoice.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "The People's Voice"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_adl_tabatabai@thepeoplesvoice.tv", "name": "Sean Adl-Tabatabai", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social distancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

The former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases came out to publicly testify for the first time at a House subcommittee hearing since leaving the government in December 2022.\n\nFar-right Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene made sure to give him a piece of her mind. Infamous for not mincing her words when striking back at things she doesn't stand by. The same pattern followed when she exploded at the former White House chief medical advisor.\n\nWhile questioning Fauci about social distancing mandates approved by the Doctor, she torched his claims as irrelevant, alleging that they weren't backed by scientific basis.\n\nAlso read | 'You're a baller': Caitlin Clark finds more support from Brittany Mahomes amid WNBA foul fracas, Angel Reese penalty\n\n\"You're not 'Doctor,' you're 'Mr' Fauci in my few minutes,\" she said after going over the reports. Greene also pulled out a photo of him, showing his failure to follow through with masking regulations. The pictured display catches Fauci with his mask pulled down at a baseball game in July 2020.\n\nGreene's heated attack threw the subcommittee into a frenzy, and members speculated if the Republican representative had violated their rules. Chairman Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio) shouted back at her to drop her demeanour of questioning. Wenstrup ordered her to address Fauci as a doctor: \"I have instructed her to address him as doctor.\"\n\nHowever, Greene shot down all such urgent orders despite several Democratic lawmakers condemning her line of action. While Wenstrup asked the members to \"refrain from using rhetoric that could be construed as an attack on the motives or character of another member or the witness,\" Greene firmly held on to her remarks.\n\nIn her closing, she added, \"You should be prosecuted from crimes against humanity,\" and finally finished with \"You belong in prison, Dr. Fauci.\"\n\nAhead of the House hearing, Greene referred to Fauci as \"Dr Frankenstein\" on her X/Twitter feed: \"Dr Frankenstein, I mean Fauci, will be appearing before our Covid Select Committee tomorrow. What would you like for me to ask him or tell him? Also, do know anyone who was permanently injured or died from Fauci's forced COVID vaccines?\"\n\nReiterating her statements on social media, MTG also tweeted, \"Prison.

His bombshell admission came before the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic that has been seeking for over a year now to determine the origins of the pandemic that killed over a million Americans and millions more globally.

Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., asked Fauci about the personal toll his role on the White House Coronavirus Taskforce cost him.\n\n'Myself, my three daughters, they have had credible death threats, leading to the arrests of different individuals,' he said. 'Credible death threats meaning someone who clearly was on their way to killing.' 'It's very troublesome to me,' he continued. 'It is even more troublesome because they involve my wife.' Fauci said such threats have require his family to have 'Protective Services essentially all the time.' His prepared remarks, delivered to the committee, also show he denies funding gan-of-function research. 'The viruses studied under the NIAID-funded EHA sub-award to [Wuhan Institute of Virology] had never been shown to infect humans, much less to cause high transmissibility or significant morbidity and mortality in humans,' his prepared testimony stated. It appeared he did not deliver them as they were submitted to the committee.\n\n'Their study, therefore, could not and did not constitute GoF research,' it continued. Fauci also sought to distance himself from his now-disgraced former top aide, Dr. David Morens (pictured), who conspired to cover-up emails from federal transparency laws. Morens testified before the body previously that he helped coronavirus researcher Dr. Peter Daszak, who had a direct financial interest in coronavirus research in Wuhan, edit press releases for the researcher's organization EcoHealth. 'I knew nothing of Dr. Morens's actions regarding EcoHealth,' Fauci said. The committee's chairman, Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, opened with a salvo calling into question Fauci's conduct during COVID. 'Americans were aggressively bullied, shamed, and silenced for merely questioning or debating issues such as social distancing, masks, vaccines, or the origins of COVID,' he said.\n\n'You took the position that you presented 'the science' and your words came across as final and as infallible in matters pertaining to the pandemic.' 'You were the highest paid person in the government. This makes you more accountable to the people, not less.' 'To be successful, our federal public health institutions must be accountable to the people again.' Previously, DailyMail.com revealed that Fauci previously testified before the body that he was not sure where the six-foot social distancing rules came from, telling committee lawyers that rule 'sort of just appeared.' He also told the counsel that he did not remember reading any studies that supported the notion that masks were effective for children.\n\nSpeaking to counsel on behalf of the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic earlier this year, Fauci told Republicans that the six foot social distancing rule 'sort of just appeared' and that he did not recall how it came about. 'You know, I don't recall. It sort of just appeared,' he said according to committee transcripts when pressed on how the rule came about. He added he 'was not aware of studies' that supported the social distancing, conceding that such studies 'would be very difficult' to do. In addition to not recalling any evidence supporting social distancing, Fauci also told the committee's counsel that he didn't remember reading anything to support that masking kids would prevent COVID.\n\n'Do you recall reviewing any studies or data supporting masking for children?' he was asked. 'I might have,' he responded before adding 'but I don't recall specifically that I did.' The pandemic patriarch also testified that he had not followed any studies after the fact regarding the impacts that forced mask wearing had on children, of which there have been many. And his answer was an ironic COVID-esque pun, 'I still think that's up in the air,' Fauci said about whether masking kids was a solid way to prevent transmission. Further, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) told the counsel that he believes the lab leak theory - the idea that COVID began at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) - is a real 'possibility.'\n\n'I think people have made conspiracy aspects from it,' he said, adding 'it could be a lab leak.' 'So I think that in and of itself isn't inherently a conspiracy theory, but some people spin off things from that that are kind of crazy.' His admission that COVID may have began at the WIV comes four years after he backed the publication of a paper which threw cold water on the lab leak theory called the 'Proximal Origin' paper. The coronavirus committee has dedicated months to discovering the origins of the virus that upended so many lives and resulted in the deaths of 6 million people globally. Recently they have discovered that Fauci's former top aide, Dr. David Morens, routinely conducted work on his personal email account and deleted files to avoid government transparency laws under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). His disregard for FOIA requests was so blatant that be bragged in emails to colleagues that he learned how to make official correspondence 'disappear' and that he would delete things he didn't 'want to see in the New York Times.'\n\nEmails from Morens uncovered by the committee further revealed that he boasted about having a 'secret back channel' to Fauci where he could clandestinely communicate with the former NIAID director. That revelation shocked the committee's chairman Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, so thoroughly that he demanded Fauci turnover his personal email and phone records to the investigative body. Also shocking, is Fauci's admission to the committee in January that he 'never' looks at the grants that he signed off on, some of which total to millions of taxpayer dollars. 'You know, technically, I sign off on each council, but I don't see the grants and what they are. I never look at what grants are there,' he told the committee's counsel. Further, he said he was 'not certain' that foreign labs that receive U.S. grant money, such as the WIV - which was studying coronaviruses using U.S. taxpayer dollars at the time the pandemic began - operate at the same standards of American labs. Fauci also said that the money he gave out as a part of the NIAID grant process did not go through any national security reviews.\n\nAdditionally, the former director said he was unaware of any conflicts of interest among his staff, which included his senior advisor Dr. Morens. However, Morens testified before the committee on May 22 that he helped his 'best friend' EcoHealth Alliance President Dr. Peter Daszak with his nonprofit's work. Morens said he helped edit press releases for EcoHealth and worked to restore grant funding for the nonprofit after it's funding was terminated in the wake of the COVID outbreak in 2020. NIH, which employs Morens, funded Daszak's EcoHealth to the tune of millions of dollars. Still, Fauci said he was unaware that Morens had any conflicts of interests. The committee will surely seek to clarify Fauci and Moren's 'secret back channel' of communication during the June 3 hearing.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

What is conspiracy is the kind of distortion of that particular subject. Like it was a lab leak and I was parachuted into the CIA like Jason Bourne.\"\n\nFauci, who is now retired, was also quick to distance himself from David Morens, the senior adviser recently targeted in the committee's investigation for emails in part revealing he advised the president of an infectious disease research group, EcoHealth Alliance, to avoid email correspondence with government accounts, which can be obtained by the public. The warning was sent when discussing the furor over a grant by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the agency Fauci led, to a EcoHealth to study coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\nMorens and Fauci worked together on some scientific papers over the years but Morens \"was not an adviser to me on institute policy,\" Fauci said.\n\nRepublicans pushed back, asking Fauci if Morens directly reported to him and if he had knowledge of Morens' advice to evade federal records requests -- and did so himself in communications.\n\n\"I don't have any idea what he's talking about, there's no backchannel at NIAID,\" Fauci said. \"I do not do government business on my private email.\"\n\nThe longtime infectious disease doctor appeared before a packed hearing room. A line for public seating snaked through the hallway; among the attendees filing in was a cluster wearing \"Got Ivermectin?\" T-shirts, a reference to the drug that was initially promoted as a way to treat or prevent Covid infections. Studies later showed it was not an effective therapy or preventative tool.\n\nCommittee Republicans on Friday released nearly 500 pages of transcripts from Fauci's January closed-door testimony. The records show that lawmakers questioned him extensively over the early days of the pandemic, when Fauci became the most visible face in federal health officials' calls for shutdowns, masks, social distancing, and dismissals of the lab leak theory.\n\nMany of the early questions Monday retread those issues, with some Republican lawmakers digging into the composition of the coronavirus and NIAID's processes for funding viral research.\n\nLooming over the hearing is a GOP push to bar so-called gain-of-function research, a field of study in which researchers make viruses more transmissible to study their spread.", "source": {"uri": "statnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "STAT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_owermohle@statnews.com", "name": "Sarah Owermohle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lab_leak_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lab leak theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Greene sneered and snickered at the former White House adviser, demanding he be imprisoned and refusing to address him as a doctor.\n\nMAGA congresswoman and professional attention-seeker Marjorie Taylor Greene turned Dr. Anthony Fauci's House testimony into a freak show on Monday when she pointedly refused to call the former White House chief medical adviser \"doctor\" and demanded he be prosecuted for \"crimes against humanity.\"\n\nThe Capitol Hill hearing, which was Fauci's first public appearance there since retiring in late 2022, was held by a House subcommittee investigating the United States' COVID-19 pandemic response and the origins of the virus. Just ahead of his appearance, the panel released transcripts of his closed-door, 14-hour testimony in January, during which he said he doesn't believe the \"lab leak\" theory is a conspiracy theory but maintained that the virus occurred naturally.\n\nGreene, who has long railed against COVID vaccines and described the pandemic as a \"manufactured plague,\" began her questioning of Fauci by accusing him of \"signing off\" on medical experiments using dogs, erroneously saying he did so as the director of the National Institute of Health. (Fauci was previously the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.)\n\n\"As a dog lover, I want to tell you this is disgusting and evil,\" Greene exclaimed while holding up disturbing images of canines involved in experiments. \"So the type of science that you are representing, Mr. Fauci, is abhorrent! And it needs to stop.\" The Georgia lawmaker, who was repeatedly fined during the pandemic for not wearing a mask on the House floor, continued to dismiss the infectious disease specialist's credentials.\n\nWhile holding up a Daily Mail headline, she claimed Fauci once admitted to \"making up\" COVID guidelines on social distancing and children wearing face masks, prompting him to push back.\n\n\"I never said I made it up,\" Fauci declared. \"I said it is not based in science and it just appeared.\" Earlier in his testimony, Fauci noted that this came from his closed-door testimony while also pointing out that the guidance initially came from the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nGreene once again held up the image of beagles while, snarking, \"but this is science,\" leading Fauci to exclaim: \"What do dogs have to do with anything we're talking about today?\"\n\nAfter moving on to reports showing that the NIH received $710 million in royalties from pharmaceutical companies since the start of the pandemic, Greene wondered if that was \"appropriate\" for the scientific community. \"Do the American people deserve to be abused like that, Mr. Fauci? Because you're not, doctor. You're Mr. Fauci in my few minutes,\" she added. \"No, I don't need your answer.\"\n\nAt that point, Democrats in the hearing had enough and demanded a point of order from Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-OH), the committee's chairman.\n\n\"In terms of the rules of decorum, are we allowed to deny a doctor is a doctor just because we don't want him to be a doctor?\" Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) wondered.\n\n\"Yes, because in my time, that man does not deserve to have a license!\" Green fired back. \"As a matter of fact, it should be revoked and he belongs in prison!\"\n\nAfter Wenstrup ordered Greene to address Fauci as a doctor, other Democrats wondered aloud if \"this is what we've devolved into\" only for the pro-Trump congresswoman to bring up a Democratic colleague's previous invocation of the infamous Tuskegee experiments.\n\n\"You know, we can do that hearing about the poor men that were injected with syphilis because I support you in that. That's horrific,\" Greene said, though it's unclear whether she thought Fauci was involved in those studies from the 1930s. \"And this government to do things like that to Americans doesn't have decorum to the American people.\"\n\nRep. Robert Garcia (D-CA), who lost both parents to COVID and praised Fauci for his policies, said it was \"completely unacceptable\" to deny a \"respected\" member of the medical community his proper title, only for Greene to sneer that Fauci was \"not respected.\"\n\nAfter Wenstrup reminded Greene to call Fauci \"doctor,\" the congresswoman shouted, \"I'm reclaiming my time\" before the chairman read through the House's rules on decorum asking members to refrain from making personal attacks. Garcia and others responded that her words should also be taken down, predictably leading Greene to react in kind.\n\nEventually, a visibly annoyed Wenstrup reiterated his reprimand of Greene while asking other members to show respect towards their colleagues. Nevertheless, Greene continued to berate Fauci for his \"repulsive evil science\" before yet again calling for him to be imprisoned.\n\n\"You know what this committee should be doing? We should be recommending you to be prosecuted. We should be writing a criminal referral because you should be prosecuted for crimes against humanity,\" she raged. \"You belong in prison, Dr. Fauci!\"\n\nMoments after the unhinged exchange, Garcia personally apologized to the former White House adviser.\n\n\"Dr. Fauci, I am so sorry you just had to sit through that. That was completely irresponsible,\" Garcia said. \"This might be the most insane hearing I've actually attended! I've only been in Congress for a year and a half, but I am so sorry that you are subjected to this level of attacks and insanity.\"\n\nGarcia wasn't the only Democrat to offer an apology over the treatment he received at the hands of conservatives. Early in the testimony, Raskin took a swipe at Donald Trump while mocking Republicans for backing the ex-president following his criminal conviction.\n\n\"Some of our colleagues in the United States House of Representatives seem to want to drag your name through the mud. They're treating you, Dr Fauci, like a convicted felon,\" Raskin quipped. \"Actually you probably wish they were treating you like a convicted felon, they treat convicted felons with love and admiration. Some of them blindly worship convicted felons.\"", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Republicans put out the full transcript of their sit down interview with Fauci from January just days before his highly- anticipated public testimony on Monday.\n\nThey plan to grill him about covid restrictions he put in place, that he admitted didn't do much to 'slow the spread' of the virus. Kids' learning loss and social setbacks have been well documented, with one National Institute of Health (NIH) study calling the impact of mask use on students' literacy and learning 'very negative.' And the impacts from social distancing caused 'depression, generalized anxiety, acute stress, and intrusive thoughts,' another NIH study found.\n\nSpeaking to counsel on behalf of the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic earlier this year, Fauci told Republicans that the six foot social distancing rule 'sort of just appeared' and that he did not recall how it came about. 'You know, I don't recall. It sort of just appeared,' he said according to committee transcripts when pressed on how the rule came about. He added he 'was not aware of studies' that supported the social distancing, conceding that such studies 'would be very difficult' to do.\n\nIn addition to not recalling any evidence supporting social distancing, Fauci also told the committee's counsel that he didn't remember reading anything to support that masking kids would prevent COVID. 'Do you recall reviewing any studies or data supporting masking for children?' he was asked. 'I might have,' he responded before adding 'but I don't recall specifically that I did.' The pandemic patriarch also testified that he had not followed any studies after the fact regarding the impacts that forced mask wearing had on children, of which there have been many.\n\nAnd his answer was an ironic COVID-esque pun, 'I still think that's up in the air,' Fauci said about whether masking kids was a solid way to prevent transmission. Further, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) told the counsel that he believes the lab leak theory - the idea that COVID began at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) - is a real 'possibility.' 'I think people have made conspiracy aspects from it,' he said, adding 'it could be a lab leak.' 'So I think that in and of itself isn't inherently a conspiracy theory, but some people spin off things from that that are kind of crazy.'\n\nHis admission that COVID may have began at the WIV comes four years after he backed the publication of a paper which threw cold water on the lab leak theory called the 'Proximal Origin' paper. The coronavirus committee has dedicated months to discovering the origins of the virus that upended so many lives and resulted in the deaths of 6 million people globally.\n\nRecently they have discovered that Fauci's former top aide, Dr. David Morens (pictured), routinely conducted work on his personal email account and deleted files to avoid government transparency laws under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). His disregard for FOIA requests was so blatant that be bragged in emails to colleagues that he learned how to make official correspondence 'disappear' and that he would delete things he didn't 'want to see in the New York Times.' Emails from Morens uncovered by the committee further revealed that he boasted about having a 'secret back channel' to Fauci where he could clandestinely communicate with the former NIAID director.\n\nThat revelation shocked the committee's chairman Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, so thoroughly that he demanded Fauci turnover his personal email and phone records to the investigative body. Also shocking, is Fauci's admission to the committee in January that he 'never' looks at the grants that he signed off on, some of which total to millions of taxpayer dollars. 'You know, technically, I sign off on each council, but I don't see the grants and what they are. I never look at what grants are there,' he told the committee's counsel. Further, he said he was 'not certain' that foreign labs that receive U.S. grant money, such as the WIV - which was studying coronaviruses using U.S. taxpayer dollars at the time the pandemic began - operate at the same standards of American labs.\n\nFauci also said that the money he gave out as a part of the NIAID grant process did not go through any national security reviews. Additionally, the former director said he was unaware of any conflicts of interest among his staff, which included his senior advisor Dr. Morens. However, Morens testified before the committee on May 22 that he helped his 'best friend' EcoHealth Alliance President Dr. Peter Daszak with his nonprofit's work.\n\nMorens (pictured) said he helped edit press releases for EcoHealth and worked to restore grant funding for the nonprofit after it's funding was terminated in the wake of the COVID outbreak in 2020. NIH, which employs Morens, funded Daszak's EcoHealth to the tune of millions of dollars. Still, Fauci said he was unaware that Morens had any conflicts of interests. The committee will surely seek to clarify Fauci and Moren's 'secret back channel' of communication during the June 3 hearing.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

These are payments made by private companies, like pharmaceuticals, to license medical innovations from government scientists.\n\nAlmost all that cash -- $690 million -- went to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the subagency led by Dr. Anthony Fauci, and 260 of its scientists.\n\nInformation about this vast private royalty complex is tightly held by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). My organization, OpenTheBooks.com, was forced to sue to uncover the royalties paid from September 2009 to October 2021, which amounted to $325 million over 56,000 transactions.\n\nWe had to sue a second time, with Judicial Watch as our counsel, to pry open this new release.\n\nPayments skyrocketed during the pandemic era: Those years saw more than double the amount of cash flow to NIH from the private sector, compared to the prior 12 combined. All told, it's $1.036 billion.\n\nIt's unclear if any of the COVID vaccine royalties from Pfizer and Moderna, the latter of which settled with NIH by agreeing to pay $400 million, is even included in these new numbers. NIH isn't saying.\n\nFauci won't be able to misspell words to evade scrutiny or have folks physically courier messages -- just two of the FOIA-avoiding actions described by Dr. David Morens, a key Fauci deputy.\n\nCharacteristically, NIH is still redacting pieces of the data that would help us more easily connect therapeutics with their government-paid inventors. For example, they refuse to show us the amount of royalties paid to each individual scientist. So we still can't entirely follow the money.\n\nSo much to be outraged about, so little time. You would have thought that we're still close enough on the historical timeline to the COVID-19 pandemic, especially here in the United States, that the news from Friday would have resulted in atomic-level public reaction.\n\nDue to the other outrage, the banana republic court verdict in lower Manhattan that was micromanaged and orchestrated by Joe Biden donor and trial judge Juan Merchan, the news about the pandemic culpability of Dr. Anthony Fauci barely registered a blip.\n\nThe top medical advisor in the White House in 2019-2023 at the height of the COVID outbreak, Dr. Anthony Fauci at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testified in January in a closed-door session of the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic. The transcript of that hearing was released last Friday.\n\nIn short, the response to the pandemic - the masks, the social distancing, the separation of families, the 6-foot spacing signs graffitied all across the country, the plexiglass walls erected to wall people off from each other, the closed schools, all of it was bovine excrement. All of it. There wasn't a lick of science behind any of the policy. It was Anthony Fauci and his team making it up as they went along, and Fauci relishing the power trip in which he found himself.\n\nIn the National Review's write-up of the release of the transcript, here is Dr. Fauci just nonchalantly admitting that masking, in this case, child masking that caused so much damage to an entire generation of child development, wasn't based in any scientific data. Fauci said this.\n\nDuring the second day of his testimony, Fauci made a similar concession about the lack of scientific evidence to support masking children to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\"Do you recall reviewing any studies or data supporting masking for children?\" a staffer asked Fauci.\n\n\"You know, I might have, Mitch, but I don't recall specifically that I did. I might have,\" Fauci replied.\n\nBased on experience and observation rather than on systematic logic. Experienced physicians often use empirical reasoning to make diagnoses, based on having seen many cases over the years. Less-experienced physicians are more likely to use diagnostic guides and manuals.", "source": {"uri": "acecomments.mu.nu", "dataType": "news", "title": "acecomments.mu.nu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Shortly after, Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, jumped in to clarify if Greene could simply ignore Fauci's title.\n\n\"Mr. Chairman, in terms of the rules of decorum, are we allowed to deny that a doctor is a doctor because we don't want him to be a doctor?\" Raskin said.\n\nRepublican lawmakers grilled Fauci during his first hearing since leaving the federal government in 2022. Fauci was testifying before the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, a panel investigating the federal response to the pandemic.\n\nFauci, the nation's foremost infectious disease expert, played a major role in shaping the response to the outbreak. Over time, then-President Donald Trump soured on Fauci's guidance. Since then, conservatives have assailed the doctor to the point that he testified that he still receives death threats.\n\nGreene defended her treatment of Fauci, replying to Raskin: \"Yes, because in my time that man does not deserve to have a license. As a matter of fact, it should be revoked, and he belongs in prison.\"\n\nShe later added that Fauci had committed \"crimes against humanity.\"\n\nFauci played a major role in the Trump administration's development of COVID-19 vaccines, which have been found to decrease the risk of hospitalization and death.\n\nRep. Brad Wenstrup of Ohio, the Republican who leads the panel, admonished Greene for her actions.\n\n\"The gentlelady should recognize the doctor as a doctor,\" Wenstrup said.\n\nRep. Robert Garcia of California, Democrat who spoke immediately after Greene, apologized to Fauci who how he was treated.\n\n\"Quite frankly -- this might be the most insane hearing I've ever attended, and I've only been in Congress for a year and a half,\" Garcia said. \"I'm so sorry that you are subjected to those levels of attacks.\"\n\nGreene, a close ally of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, has returned to her roots of challenging GOP leadership and upending House hearings with her questions.

It sort of just appeared,\" he said according to committee transcripts when questioned about the rule's origin.\n\nHe also mentioned he \"was not aware of studies\" supporting social distancing, admitting that such studies \"would be very difficult\" to conduct.\n\nIn addition to not recalling evidence supporting social distancing, Fauci also told the committee's counsel that he couldn't remember reviewing anything that supported masking children to prevent COVID-19.\n\n\"Do you recall reviewing any studies or data supporting masking for children?\" he was asked.\n\n\"I might have,\" he replied, adding \"but I don't recall specifically that I did.\"\n\nFauci also testified that he did not follow any studies regarding the impacts of forced mask-wearing on children, despite numerous such studies existing.\n\nIronically, he commented, \"I still think that's up in the air,\" regarding whether masking children was an effective way to prevent transmission.\n\nFurthermore, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) acknowledged that the lab leak theory -- the notion that COVID-19 originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) -- is a legitimate \"possibility.\"\n\n\"I think people have made conspiracy aspects from it,\" he said, adding \"it could be a lab leak.\"\n\n\"So I think that in and of itself isn't inherently a conspiracy theory, but some people spin off things from that that are kind of crazy.\"\n\nHis admission that COVID-19 may have originated at the WIV comes four years after he supported the publication of a paper dismissing the lab leak theory, known as the \"Proximal Origin\" paper.\n\nThe coronavirus committee has spent months investigating the origins of the virus that disrupted so many lives and resulted in the deaths of 6 million people worldwide.\n\nRecently, they discovered that Fauci's former top aide, Dr. David Morens, frequently conducted work on his personal email account and deleted files to circumvent government transparency laws under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).\n\nMorens' disregard for FOIA requests was so blatant that he bragged in emails to colleagues about learning how to make official correspondence \"disappear\" and that he would delete things he didn't \"want to see in the New York Times.\"\n\nEmails from Morens, uncovered by the committee, revealed that he boasted about having a \"secret back channel\" to Fauci, allowing him to covertly communicate with the former NIAID director.\n\nThis revelation stunned the committee's chairman, Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, who demanded that Fauci turn over his personal email and phone records to the investigative body.\n\nEqually surprising was Fauci's January admission to the committee that he \"never\" reviewed the grants he approved, some of which amounted to millions of taxpayer dollars.\n\n\"You know, technically, I sign off on each council, but I don't see the grants and what they are. I never look at what grants are there,\" he told the committee's counsel.\n\nMoreover, he stated he was \"not certain\" that foreign labs receiving U.S. grant money, such as the WIV -- studying coronaviruses with U.S. taxpayer dollars at the pandemic's onset -- operated under the same standards as American labs.\n\nFauci also said the funds he distributed as part of the NIAID grant process did not undergo any national security reviews.\n\nAdditionally, the former director claimed he was unaware of any conflicts of interest among his staff, including his senior advisor Dr. Morens.\n\nHowever, Morens testified before the committee on May 22 that he assisted his \"best friend,\" EcoHealth Alliance President Dr. Peter Daszak, with his nonprofit's work.\n\nMorens said he helped edit press releases for EcoHealth and worked to restore grant funding for the nonprofit after its funding was terminated following the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020.\n\nThe NIH, which employs Morens, funded Daszak's EcoHealth to the tune of millions of dollars.\n\nStill, Fauci claimed he was unaware that Morens had any conflicts of interest.\n\nThe committee will likely seek to clarify Fauci and Morens' \"secret back channel\" of communication during the June 3 hearing.", "source": {"uri": "matzav.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "matzav.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social distancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

He conceded that studies validating the effectiveness of social distancing would be \"very difficult\" to conduct.\n\nFauci also admitted to lacking specific data supporting the use of masks for children to prevent COVID-19 transmission. When asked if he reviewed any studies or data on the effectiveness of masking children, he responded, \"I might have, but I don't recall specifically that I did.\" He further acknowledged not following up on subsequent studies regarding the impacts of mandatory mask use on children, many of which have reported negative effects on students' literacy and learning.\n\nThe Republican-released transcript comes just days before Fauci's scheduled testimony, where he is expected to be grilled about the effectiveness of the COVID restrictions he implemented. Critics have pointed to studies highlighting the adverse effects of these measures, including significant learning losses and social setbacks among children.

Dr. Fauci served as the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and was the face of America's public health response during the COVID-19 pandemic. His closed door, 14-hour, two-day testimony in January 2024 has served as a critical component of the Select Subcommittee's investigations into the origins of COVID-19, pandemic-era domestic policy failures, and improvements to the United States' public health system. In conjunction with the transcript, the Select Subcommittee also released a new staff memo that highlights the key takeaways from Dr. Fauci's transcribed interview. The memo can be found here.\n\nThe Select Subcommittee also released four additional transcripts from senior public health officials. These transcripts, as well as Dr. Fauci's transcript, can be found below:\n\nBelow are important exchanges from Dr. Fauci's transcribed interview:\n\nSOCIAL DISTANCING: The \"6 feet apart\" social distancing recommendation forced on Americans by federal health officials was arbitrary and not based on science. Dr. Fauci testified that this guidance -- which shut down schools and small businesses nationwide -- \"sort of just appeared\" and was not based on any scientific studies.\n\nMajority Counsel: \"Do you recall when discussions regarding, kind of, the at least a 6 foot threshold began?\"\n\nMajority Counsel: \" -- it was applied in schools, it was applied here. At least how the messaging was applied was that 6-foot distancing was the distance that needed to be -- \"\n\nDr. Fauci: \"You know, I don't recall. It sort of just appeared. I don't recall, like, a discussion of whether it should be 5 or 6 or whatever. It was just that 6 foot is -- \"\n\nMajority Counsel: \"Did you see any studies that supported 6 feet?\"\n\nDr. Fauci: \"I was not aware of studies that in fact, that would be a very difficult study to do.\"\n\nMASKING: Dr. Fauci testified that he did not recall any supporting evidence for masking children. Concerningly, mask-wearing has been associated with learning loss and severe speech development issues in America's children.\n\nMajority Counsel: \"Do you recall reviewing any studies or data supporting masking for children?\"\n\nDr. Fauci: \"You know, I might have, Mitch, but I don't recall specifically that I did. I might have.\"\n\nMajority Counsel: \"Since the -- there's been a lot of studies that have come out since the pandemic started, but specifically on this there have been significant on kind of like the learning loss and speech and development issues that have been associated with particularly young children wearing masks while they're growing up. They can't see their teacher talk and can't learn how to form words. Have you followed any of those studies?\"\n\nDr. Fauci: \"No. But I believe that there are a lot of conflicting studies too, that there are those that say, yes, there is an impact, and there are those that say there's not. I still think that's up in the air.\"\n\nTRAVEL RESTRICTIONS: Dr. Fauci unequivocally agreed with EVERY travel restriction issued by the Trump Administration at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. This testimony runs counter to the public narrative that the Trump Administration's travel restrictions were xenophobic. During his transcribed interview, the Biden Administration's counsel curiously prohibited Dr. Fauci from answering questions on whether he recommended the travel restrictions.\n\nMajority Counsel: \"Did you agree with President Trump's decision to restrict travel from China?\"\n\nDr. Fauci: \"I did, and I said there were caveats to restrictions. I agreed with it, but I said we have to be careful because sometimes when you do restrictions they have negative consequences in that you don't have open access to help or even information. But fundamentally, I agreed at that time, since we had almost no infections that we knew of in our country, that at least a temporary restriction would be important.\"\n\nMajority Counsel: \"Did you recommend instituting travel restrictions in response to the pandemic?\"\n\nBiden Administration Official: \"I'm going to step in here.\"\n\nVACCINE MANDATES: Dr. Fauci admitted that vaccine mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic could increase vaccine hesitancy in the future. He also claimed that these mandates were not sufficiently studied ahead of the pandemic. Previously, Dr. Fauci advocated \"that when you make it difficult for people in their lives, they lose their ideological bullshit, and they get vaccinated.\"\n\nMajority Counsel: \"Do you think mandating vaccines can result in some hesitancy?\"\n\nDr. Fauci: \"I think one of the things that we really need to do after the fact, now, to -- you know, after-the-game, after-the-event evaluation of things that need to be done, we really need to take a look at the psyche of the country, have maybe some social-type studies to figure out, does the mandating of vaccines in the way the country's mental framework is right now, does that actually cause more people to not want to get vaccinated, or not? I don't know. But I think that's something we need to know.\"\n\nLAB LEAK THEORY: Dr. Fauci acknowledged that the lab leak hypothesis is not a conspiracy theory. This comes nearly four years after prompting the publication of the now infamous \"Proximal Origin\" paper that attempted to vilify and disprove the lab leak hypothesis.\n\nMajority Counsel: \"Just you sitting here today, do you think the possibility or the hypothesis that the coronavirus emerged from a laboratory accident is a conspiracy theory?\"\n\nDr. Fauci: \"Well, it's a possibility. I think people have made conspiracy aspects from it. And I think you have to separate the two when you keep an open mind, that it could be a lab leak or it could be a natural occurrence. I've mentioned in this committee that I believe the evidence that I've seen weighs my opinion towards one, which is a natural occurrence, but I still leave an open mind. So I think that in and of itself isn't inherently a conspiracy theory, but some people spin off things from that that are kind of crazy.\"\n\nGAIN-OF-FUNCTION RESEARCH: Dr. Fauci repeatedly played semantics with the definition of \"gain-of-function\" research in an effort to avoid conceding that the NIH's funded this dangerous research in China. As the head of NIAID and the face of America's response to the pandemic, Dr. Fauci certainly understood the common definition of \"gain-of-function.\" Yet, he repeatedly refused -- both behind closed doors and to Sen. Rand Paul during a 2021 hearing -- to clarify a general understanding of the term and instead only referred to his own \"operative definition.\n\nDr. Fauci: \"So, when I, to repeat, when I'm asked is something gain of function, I'm referring to the operative definition of gain of function according to the framework of the 3PCO...That's my definition. That is the regulatory operational definition. And as we were talking about before, other people use the word \"gain of function\" this, \"gain of function\" that, and everybody's got their own interpretation of it. But when you're deciding whether a grant should be funded, this is the operational definition. And when I was asked anywhere by the Congress, by the Senate, by Senator Paul this is what I was referring to.\"\n\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST: Dr. Fauci claimed that his staff had no conflicts of interest regarding the origins of COVID-19, yet his Senior Advisor -- Dr. David Morens -- was \"best-friends\" with disgraced and soon-to-be debarred EcoHealth Alliance President Dr. Peter Daszak. Considering Dr. Morens worked under Dr. Fauci's leadership for more than 20 years, it seems highly unlikely that Dr. Fauci was genuinely unaware of this relationship.\n\nMajority Counsel: \"I was wondering if you had thoughts on whether Dr. Daszak should have filed competing interest statements when he was weighing in on these issues, whether through the National Academies or other venues.\"\n\nDr. Fauci: \"You know, I hesitate to speculate about what someone else should do. The only people that I am involved with is my own staff, who we've mentioned many times in this discussion, who don't have a conflict of interest.\"\n\nGRANT APPROVAL: Dr. Fauci testified that he signed off on every foreign and domestic NIAID grant without reviewing the proposals. He was also unable to confirm if NIAID has ANY mechanisms to conduct oversight of the foreign laboratories they fund. NIAID's flawed grant process -- which relies heavily on trusting its grantees without verifying -- leaves opportunities for adversaries to exploit.\n\nMajority Counsel: \"Who gives the final approval?\"\n\nDr. Fauci: \"You know, technically, I sign off on each council, but I don't see the grants and what they are. I never look at what grants are there. It's just somebody at the end of the council where they're all finished and they go, 'Here,' and you sign it.\"\n\n...\n\nMajority Counsel: \"Okay. So to your knowledge, NIAID wouldn't kind of independently verify the biosafety of a foreign lab?\"\n\nDr. Fauci: \"Again, I'd have to say I'm not sure. To my knowledge, I wouldn't be able to make a statement that I would be confident it would be.\"\n\n...\n\nMajority Counsel: \"Do you know if NIAID grants go through any type of national security review as part of the process?\"\n\nMajority Counsel: \"I guess what we're trying to learn going forward is, obviously, U.S. labs are vetted, certified, and there's a standard of how U.S. labs operate. Are foreign labs held to the same standard as U.S. labs when they receive U.S. money, or are they the standards of the country in which they operate?\"\n\nDr. Fauci: \"When I was the director, no one ever asked me, you know, who determines, you know, what the standards of a foreign lab are. But so the answer to your question is I don't know, okay?\"\n\nFEIGNED IGNORANCE: Dr. Fauci claimed he \"did not recall\" numerous issues and events surrounding the pandemic more than 100 times. Specifically, Dr. Fauci testified that despite the fact EcoHealth Alliance was conducting risky gain-of-function research in China, he did not know any details about the grant, nor did he maintain a relationship with its President, Dr. Peter Daszak.\n\nMajority Counsel: \"Do you recall when you first found out that the year 5 progress report was missing from the EcoHealth grant?\"\n\nDr. Fauci: \"I don't recall precisely. It was somewhere on a briefing that the staff gave to me. I don't know exactly when that was. It could have been later. I don't know.\"\n\nMajority Counsel: \"Okay. Do you think, just to the best of your recollection, whether it was before you were aware that the year 5 progress report was late before May 2021 or it would have been after?\"", "source": {"uri": "oversight.house.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "House Committee on Oversight and Reform"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gain-of-function_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gain-of-function research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social distancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

You would have thought that we're still close enough on the historical timeline to the COVID-19 pandemic, especially here in the United States, that the news from Friday would have resulted in atomic-level public reaction.\n\nDue to the other outrage, the banana republic court verdict in lower Manhattan that was micromanaged and orchestrated by Joe Biden donor and trial judge Juan Merchan, the news about the pandemic culpability of Dr. Anthony Fauci barely registered a blip.\n\nThe top medical advisor in the White House in 2019-2023 at the height of the COVID outbreak, Dr. Anthony Fauci at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testified in January in a closed-door session of the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic. The transcript of that hearing was released last Friday.\n\nIn short, the response to the pandemic - the masks, the social distancing, the separation of families, the 6-foot spacing signs graffitied all across the country, the plexiglass walls erected to wall people off from each other, the closed schools, all of it was bovine excrement. All of it. There wasn't a lick of science behind any of the policy. It was Anthony Fauci and his team making it up as they went along, and Fauci relishing the power trip in which he found himself.\n\nIn the National Review's write-up of the release of the transcript, here is Dr. Fauci just nonchalantly admitting that masking, in this case, child masking that caused so much damage to an entire generation of child development, wasn't based in any scientific data. Fauci said this.\n\nDuring the second day of his testimony, Fauci made a similar concession about the lack of scientific evidence to support masking children to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\"Do you recall reviewing any studies or data supporting masking for children?\" a staffer asked Fauci.\n\n\"You know, I might have, Mitch, but I don't recall specifically that I did. I might have,\" Fauci replied.\n\nKeep in mind, this was Anthony Fauci on 60 Minutes before the pandemic really took hold, on the efficaciousness of masking.\n\nIt turned into masking, double masking, masking alone indoors, masking alone in your car, masking children as young as two-years old, and this policy lasted for over two years.\n\nOn social distancing, here's the part of the transcript that the Washington Post reports.\n\n\"It sort of just appeared, that six feet is going to be the distance,\" Fauci testified to Congress in a January closed-door hearing, according to a transcribed interview released Friday. Fauci characterized the recommendation as \"an empiric decision that wasn't based on data.\"\n\nFrancis S. Collins, former director of the National Institutes of Health, also privately testified to Congress in January that he was not aware of evidence behind the social distancing recommendation, according to a transcript released in May.\n\nFour years later, visible reminders of the six-foot rule remain with us, particularly in cities that rushed to adopt the CDC's guidelines hoping to protect residents and keep businesses open. D.C. is dotted with signs in stores and schools -- even on sidewalks or in government buildings -- urging people to stand six feet apart.\n\nMy step-son was a freshman in high school in 2020 when the pandemic arrived. One of the last school functions he was able to participate in was the Chinese New Year Parade in downtown San Francisco. He played trumpet in marching band, and in the back of our minds, we knew this flu thing was out there and just starting to pop up in the States in Early February, but we went on the trip anyway. The crowd was one-third its normal size, and little did we know what was about to happen. School was shut down a few weeks later and moved to remote learning for the rest of the school year, and for the first half of his sophomore year.\n\nWhen school did reopen to in-class learning, double masking was strongly recommended, and band, of any kind, was not immediately available. After a period of time, and a lot of negotiation and wrangling between the band director, the school district, and county, state and federal officials, the band was eventually allowed to play under the following conditions: students could not play music together indoors. It could only be performed outdoors, with 12-foot spacing between students/instruments. All bell instruments (horns), had to have elastic cloth screens over the bells to prevent COVID flying out in B-flat.\n\nMusicians had to wear masks over their nose and mouth until the last second before they had to play. Then, they could pull down the mask, play their part, and immediately mask back up. Some students had masks that had slits cut out of the mouth where the instrument's mouthpiece could fit through. All this was strictly enforced, or else risking the shutting down of the whole program. And thanks to the testimony of Dr. Fauci, the house of cards was shown that all of this guidance was issued by a whole bunch of bureaucrats at all levels of government who had no science, no data, nothing at all to back up the policy. They were winging it.\n\nHave you ever heard a band try to play as a unit spaced out twelve feet apart from the opposite end of the stadium a hundred yards away? I have. It sounds a little thin. The restrictions and headaches suffered just in order to let kids play music was so onerous, it drove our high school's band director into early retirement in 2021.\n\nAs late as April of 2022, Fauci was still on television threatening to put the masks back on.\n\nAgain, there was still no scientific data that warranted the fearmongering by Fauci.\n\nThe vaccines came up, too, in the January transcript. Full disclosure: I had COVID twice. Took Ivermectin both times, immediately recovered. I did have the initial two-dose vaccine afterwards, and one booster. I've had no ill effects, and will not weigh in on the controversy around the vaccines, or alternative treatment regimens, here. I am not hostile to the vaccines, nor am I hostile to any treatment that works against the virus. But here is what Dr. Fauci said about the vaccines from the House Select Committee's transcript release:\n\nVACCINE MANDATES: Dr. Fauci admitted that vaccine mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic could increase vaccine hesitancy in the future. He also claimed that these mandates were not sufficiently studied ahead of the pandemic. Previously, Dr. Fauci advocated \"that when you make it difficult for people in their lives, they lose their ideological bullshit, and they get vaccinated.\"\n\nMajority Counsel: \"Do you think mandating vaccines can result in some hesitancy?\"\n\nDr. Fauci: \"I think one of the things that we really need to do after the fact, now, to -- you know, after-the-game, after-the-event evaluation of things that need to be done, we really need to take a look at the psyche of the country, have maybe some social-type studies to figure out, does the mandating of vaccines in the way the country's mental framework is right now, does that actually cause more people to not want to get vaccinated, or not? I don't know. But I think that's something we need to know.\"\n\nYou want to fly around the country, Fauci asks, you have to get vaccinated. His rules.\n\n[Duane 'Generalissimo' Patterson has exclusive content for VIP members every week, and co-hosts the VIP show \"Week in Review\" with Ed every Friday.

Are every one of those deaths laid at the feet of Anthony Fauci? Of course, not. But a whole bunch of them are, because at the height of his reign, and during COVID, he ruled policy with an iron fist, Fauci's word was not just accepted internationally as the gospel truth, it was regarded as science itself.\n\nOf course, we now know, and Fauci just confirmed, that he was making science up. At what cost? Well, child speech development, for starters.\n\nIn a report from 2022, two years after the start of the pandemic, 95 percent of health visitors reported that the pandemic was having an ongoing negative impact on children's communication, speech, and language skills. Indeed, children born in the first three months of the pandemic met fewer communication developmental milestones compared to those born pre-pandemic. When these children were 1 year old, only 77 percent could express one definite and meaningful word, compared to 98 percent of pre-pandemic babies. Similar differences were observed for other important language milestones such as pointing and waving goodbye.\n\nRemember being separated from your family members, especially grandparents from their grandkids?\n\nRemember not being allowed to hold funeral services, because you couldn't congregate in groups? And if you did, and felt the need to comfort someone in mourning, stuff like this happened?\n\nRemember how many people died in the hospital alone, because no visitors were allowed in to keep the COVID from spreading?\n\nRemember the trillions of dollars this economy lost, all the businesses that didn't survive the shutdown, the job losses, the inflation as a result of over-stimulating an economy that never should have been shut down in the first place? That's all Mr. Science, Anthony Fauci.\n\nDr. Fauci is supposed to testify in an open hearing in front of House Oversight, and is expected to have to answer for newly-discovered emails from an aide that possibly implicate Fauci's culpability in helping to fund the origin of the virus as part of NIAID's gain of function research grant program.\n\nIn a just world, the House Republicans would bring in Kentucky Senator Rand Paul and use him as their lead counsel, ceding him the time to just have at it with Fauci once and for all.\n\nThere are lots of rotten people in government, both present and recently-retired. Joe Biden certainly ranks up there. John Kerry, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Alejandro Mayorkas, Jennifer Granholm, Merrick Garland, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, and Adam Schiff would make a pretty good top ten of bad people. Note that I do not include Kamala Harris in this list, due to the fact that I believe she would head up an entirely different list of morons in government, which are wholly different than rotten.\n\nBut don't overlook Dr. Fauci on the rotten list. He's easily top five. After what we read from his testimony back in January, he probably makes the top three. After today's hearing, we'll have to revisit his ranking.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "duane_patterson@hotair.com", "name": "Duane Patterson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social distancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Kennedy Jr., for example, used an appearance at last weekend's Libertarian National Convention to attack Trump's pandemic response.\n\n\"He was initially very reluctant to impose lockdowns, but then he got rolled by his bureaucrats,\" Kennedy said. \"He caved in, and many of our most fundamental rights disappeared practically overnight.\"\n\nTrump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt snapped back, calling Kennedy a \"radical leftist and environmental whack job\" who loves electric vehicle mandates and hates the National Rifle Association. Meanwhile, Trump is working to distance himself from Fauci.\n\n\"Fauci wasn't a big player in my administration like he was after I left,\" Trump told podcaster Tim Pool. \"Biden made him the king of everything.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign may have to field more Fauci-related questions amid his testimony to Congress and his book On Call: A Doctor's Journey in Public Service, which will be released on June 18 and likely provide Fauci with a new round of press interviews.\n\nBiden won the 2020 race largely on his pandemic messaging, and he's reminding voters of that fact this year.\n\n\"[Trump] recently asked the infamous question: Are you better off today than you were four years ago? Well, Donald, I'm glad you asked the question,\" Biden said during a New York fundraiser on March 29. \"I hope everyone in this country takes a moment to think back to where you were in March of 2020. And, you know, COVID came to America. Trump was president. He tried to downplay the whole virus. ... He told Americans to inject bleach.\"\n\nBiden embraced Fauci once in office as he promised to follow the science out of the pandemic. But the unfolding email scandal paints Fauci in a less-than-flattering light as Morens worked to shield him from any ties to compromising situations.\n\n\"We are getting FOIA'd non stop,\" Morens wrote in April 2021, \"so it's most important that Tony not have anything on the record that could come back to bite.\"\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-KY), perhaps the most prominent Fauci critic in Congress, has called for the Biden Department of Justice to investigate Morens and says Fauci could be indicted on the basis of destroying federal records. Paul has his own book, Deception: The Great COVID Cover-Up, that features Fauci on the cover.\n\nThe White House and the Justice Department did not respond to questions from the Washington Examiner.\n\nEmails between Morens and EcoHealth's Peter Daszak include references to the two presidents, with both showing a clear disdain for Trump. On April 26, 2020, Daszak said that Trump is \"shockingly ignorant and unconcerned about the damage his actions have.\" After EcoHealth won a $7.5 million grant in August of that year, Morens wrote that \"there is still justice in a Trump-infected universe.\"\n\nBut University of California, Irvine public health professor Andrew Noymer said it's not easy to compare the pandemic responses of the two presidents.\n\n\"It's really apples and oranges,\" he said. \"Trump was on duty during the onset of the pandemic, and Biden came into office when people had access to vaccines. That's one of many differences, but the point is it was a different phase. So direct comparisons are hard.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nAnother factor is that with the pandemic now firmly in the rear view, the public will tune out no matter what happens with Fauci or who is vindicated by congressional revelations.\n\n\"I doubt it,\" Republican strategist Doug Heye said when asked if the pandemic will be a big campaign issue. \"That's in most people's rear-view mirror.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "haisten_willis@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Haisten Willis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci disavowed a longtime senior adviser at a congressional hearing on June 3 and said the official violated federal rules by using personal email for official business and editing the press release of a government grantee.\n\nDr. David Morens's title is senior scientific adviser in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) office of the director. Dr. Fauci was the director from 1984 through 2022.\n\nDr. Morens recently acknowledged to the U.S. House of Representatives Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic that he deleted emails, after unearthed messages showed him bragging about learning how to avoid the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). He also communicated frequently with Peter Daszak, the head of the EcoHealth Alliance, which funneled NIAID grant money to a lab in China.\n\n\"I knew nothing of Dr. Morens's actions regarding Dr. Daszak, EcoHealth, or his emails,\" said Dr. Fauci. \"It is important to point out for the record that, despite his title, and even though he was helpful to me in writing scientific papers, Dr. Morens was not an adviser to me on institute policy or other substantive issues.\"\n\nDr. Fauci also said that Dr. Morens did not take part in regular meetings of NIAID leadership or of his immediate staff before agreeing that Dr. Morens violated federal rules by editing an EcoHealth press release, reaching out to the EcoHealth board on behalf of Mr. Daszak, and using personal email for official business.\n\nDr. Morens often spoke of talking with Dr. Fauci, including writing after the government paused the primary EcoHealth grant that \"Peter, from Tony's numerous recent comments to me, they are trying to protect you.\"\n\n\"I never spoke about protecting him,\" Dr. Fauci said. \"I don't know where he got that, but that's not true.\"\n\nIn another missive, Dr. Morens wrote: \"I forgot to say there is no worry about FOIAs. I can either send stuff to Tony on his private gmail, or hand it to him at work or at his house. He is too smart to let colleagues send him stuff that could cause trouble.\"\n\nDr. Fauci said he might have spoken to Dr. Morens over personal email addresses about chapters they write for medical books. \"I do not do government business on my private email,\" he said.\n\nMembers highlighted Dr. Morens's actions and those of Greg Folkers, an aide to Dr. Fauci who used strange letter substitutions in an apparent bid to evade FOIA.\n\n\"These men were among your most senior and trusted staff,\" Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.) said, pointing to email and calendar records.\n\n\"It is hard to believe that all of this occurred without your knowledge and/or approval,\" he added later.\n\nRep. James Comer (R-Ky.) said the actions showed a \"troubling pattern of behavior from your inner circle.\"\n\nDemocrats largely expressed support for Dr. Fauci and condemned what they described as GOP attacks against him.\n\n\"You and our top scientists did everything you could to keep Americans safe during the deadly days of COVID-19,\" Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) said.\n\n\"The vast majority of Americans appreciate your work over the years,\" she also said.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Ironically, however, Fauci permitted the George Floyd protests and riots to wreak havoc across the country.\n\nBelow is Dr. Fauci's transcribed interview via the COVID Select Subcommittee:\n\nSOCIAL DISTANCING: The \"6 feet apart\" social distancing recommendation forced on Americans by federal health officials was arbitrary and not based on science.\n\nMajority Counsel: \"Do you recall when discussions regarding, kind of, the at least a 6 foot threshold began?\"\n\nDr. Fauci: \"The 6 foot in the school?\"\n\nMajority Counsel: \"Six foot overall. I mean, 6-foot was applied at businesses -- \"\n\nDr. Fauci: \"Yeah.\"\n\nMajority Counsel: \" -- it was applied in schools, it was applied here. At least how the messaging was applied was that 6-foot distancing was the distance that needed to be -- \"\n\nDr. Fauci: \"You know, I don't recall. It sort of just appeared. I don't recall, like, a discussion of whether it should be 5 or 6 or whatever. It was just that 6 foot is -- \"\n\nMajority Counsel: \"Did you see any studies that supported 6 feet?\"\n\nDr. Fauci: \"I was not aware of studies that in fact, that would be a very difficult study to do.\"\n\nFrancis Collins, the former director of the National Insitute of Health, admitted in a closed-door interview earlier this year that he did not see any scientific evidence that social distancing was a proven method of containing the virus.\n\nThe controversy extends beyond social distancing. During the pandemic, Americans were subjected to strict mask mandates, with penalties imposed on those who did not comply. These mandates covered everyone - from adults entering businesses to children in schools. Now, it appears these directives were also issued without a solid foundation in science.\n\nWhen questioned about the evidence supporting the masking of children, Dr. Fauci's memory was unclear.\n\nBelow is Dr. Fauci's transcribed interview via the COVID Select Subcommittee:\n\nMASKING: Dr. Fauci testified that he did not recall any supporting evidence for masking children. Concerningly, mask-wearing has been associated with learning loss and severe speech development issues in America's children.\n\nMajority Counsel: \"Do you recall reviewing any studies or data supporting masking for children?\"\n\nDr. Fauci: \"You know, I might have, Mitch, but I don't recall specifically that I did. I might have.\"\n\nMajority Counsel: \"Since the -- there's been a lot of studies that have come out since the pandemic started, but specifically on this there have been significant on kind of like the learning loss and speech and development issues that have been associated with particularly young children wearing masks while they're growing up. They can't see their teacher talk and can't learn how to form words. Have you followed any of those studies?\"\n\nDr. Fauci: \"No. But I believe that there are a lot of conflicting studies too, that there are those that say, yes, there is an impact, and there are those that say there's not. I still think that's up in the air.\"\n\nYou can read the key takeaways in the new memo here.\n\nSo there you have it. Time and time again, those of us, including The Gateway Pundit, who questioned every aspect of the COVID pandemic, from the lockdown regimes and mask mandates all the way through to vaccines and potential treatments, have been proven correct.\n\nU.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY), Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, joined Maria Bartiromo to discuss Fauci's upcoming hearing on Monday.\n\nEarlier this month, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) finally admitted to funding gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the site of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis admission directly contradicts previous statements made under oath by Dr. Anthony Fauci,\n\n\"Fauci lied.

Kennedy Jr., for example, used an appearance at last weekend's Libertarian National Convention to attack Trump's pandemic response.\n\n\"He was initially very reluctant to impose lockdowns, but then he got rolled by his bureaucrats,\" Kennedy said. \"He caved in, and many of our most fundamental rights disappeared practically overnight.\"\n\nTrump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt snapped back, calling Kennedy a \"radical leftist and environmental whack job\" who loves electric vehicle mandates and hates the National Rifle Association. Meanwhile, Trump is working to distance himself from Fauci.\n\n\"Fauci wasn't a big player in my administration like he was after I left,\" Trump told podcaster Tim Pool. \"Biden made him the king of everything.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign may have to field more Fauci-related questions amid his testimony to Congress and his book On Call: A Doctor's Journey in Public Service, which will be released on June 18 and likely provide Fauci with a new round of press interviews.\n\nBiden won the 2020 race largely on his pandemic messaging, and he's reminding voters of that fact this year.\n\n\"[Trump] recently asked the infamous question: Are you better off today than you were four years ago? Well, Donald, I'm glad you asked the question,\" Biden said during a New York fundraiser on March 29. \"I hope everyone in this country takes a moment to think back to where you were in March of 2020. And, you know, COVID came to America. Trump was president. He tried to downplay the whole virus. ... He told Americans to inject bleach.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nBiden embraced Fauci once in office as he promised to follow the science out of the pandemic. But the unfolding email scandal paints Fauci in a less-than-flattering light as Morens worked to shield him from any ties to compromising situations.\n\n\"We are getting FOIA'd non stop,\" Morens wrote in April 2021, \"so it's most important that Tony not have anything on the record that could come back to bite.\"\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-KY), perhaps the most prominent Fauci critic in Congress, has called for the Biden Department of Justice to investigate Morens and says Fauci could be indicted on the basis of destroying federal records. Paul has his own book, Deception: The Great COVID Cover-Up, that features Fauci on the cover.\n\nThe White House and the Justice Department did not respond to questions from the Washington Examiner.\n\nEmails between Morens and EcoHealth's Peter Daszak include references to the two presidents, with both showing a clear disdain for Trump. On April 26, 2020, Daszak said that Trump is \"shockingly ignorant and unconcerned about the damage his actions have.\" After EcoHealth won a $7.5 million grant in August of that year, Morens wrote that \"there is still justice in a Trump-infected universe.\"\n\nBut University of California, Irvine public health professor Andrew Noymer said it's not easy to compare the pandemic responses of the two presidents.\n\n\"It's really apples and oranges,\" he said. \"Trump was on duty during the onset of the pandemic, and Biden came into office when people had access to vaccines. That's one of many differences, but the point is it was a different phase.

Four years later, and over 10 million Americans are still suffering from long COVID. We continue to fight for accountability.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, in his role as chief medical adviser to the president, insisted upon mask and vaccine mandates, lockdowns, and overstated vaccine efficacy, often disregarding the public's and private medical professional's ability to assess the facts.\n\nMany lessons must be learned from Dr. Fauci's tenure, highlighting the need for supervision and ethical leadership. As a physician, I believe in informing patients of the truth and collaborating on plans.\n\nThis week, he will testify before the House of Representatives. We must demand answers for the numerous unresolved issues related to his potential role in the origins of COVID-19, and the subsequent alleged cover-up. Here are several questions I hope are asked:\n\nDr. Fauci has advocated for and funded risky GOF research for over 30 years. He was undoubtedly aware of the history of the engineering and structural problems, along with sloppy procedural issues, at the labs in Wuhan, China.\n\nHe knew the Chinese military was involved in all research at Wuhan laboratories, including that China's military ran a bioweapons program at the Wuhan Institute of Virology labs. Yet, Dr. Fauci continued to use taxpayer money to fund the research projects in Wuhan, China.\n\nWhen confronted about this, Dr. Fauci claimed ignorance, but it was his responsibility to ensure compliance with these grants. This lack of oversight highlights the immediate need for increased accountability at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the necessity for its own inspector general.\n\nWhen following the evidence, Dr. Fauci often sought counsel from questionable advisers and scientists with clear conflicts of interest.\n\nThe Federal Advisory Committee Act mandates that advice given to the federal government by advisory committees be objective, transparent, and publicly accessible. However, email records show that Dr. Fauci consulted his close network of private scientists, some of whom financially benefited from the NIH grants Dr. Fauci oversees, and some in that group were waiting on a grant approval worth up to $9 million.\n\nImportantly, after that meeting, the Fauci-led group published the \"Proximal Origins\" theory, concluding that SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a \"natural virus.\" Once published, Dr. Fauci seemingly embarked on a mass media cover-up and touted that opinion piece that he orchestrated as scientific fact, even referencing it from the White House podium.\n\nMany people also do not know that Dr. Fauci received two government salaries simultaneously, making him the highest-paid federal employee ever. He was both the director of the NIAID and the director of civilian biodefense, which was operating with a $6 billion budget.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

It sort of just appeared,' he said according to committee transcripts when pressed on how the rule came about.\n\nHe added he 'was not aware of studies' that supported the social distancing, conceding that such studies 'would be very difficult' to do.\n\nIn addition to not recalling any evidence supporting social distancing, Fauci also told the committee's counsel that he didn't remember reading anything to support that masking kids would prevent COVID.\n\n'Do you recall reviewing any studies or data supporting masking for children?' he was asked.\n\n'I might have,' he responded before adding 'but I don't recall specifically that I did.'\n\nThe pandemic patriarch also testified that he had not followed any studies after the fact regarding the impacts that forced mask wearing had on children, of which there have been many.\n\nAnd his answer was an ironic COVID-esque pun, 'I still think that's up in the air,' Fauci said about whether masking kids was a solid way to prevent transmission.\n\nFurther, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) told the counsel that he believes the lab leak theory - the idea that COVID began at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) - is a real 'possibility.'\n\n'I think people have made conspiracy aspects from it,' he said, adding 'it could be a lab leak.'\n\n'So I think that in and of itself isn't inherently a conspiracy theory, but some people spin off things from that that are kind of crazy.'\n\nHis admission that COVID may have began at the WIV comes four years after he backed the publication of a paper which threw cold water on the lab leak theory called the 'Proximal Origin' paper.\n\nThe coronavirus committee has dedicated months to discovering the origins of the virus that upended so many lives and resulted in the deaths of 6 million people globally.\n\nRecently they have discovered that Fauci's former top aide, Dr. David Morens, routinely conducted work on his personal email account and deleted files to avoid government transparency laws under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).\n\nHis disregard for FOIA requests was so blatant that be bragged in emails to colleagues that he learned how to make official correspondence 'disappear' and that he would delete things he didn't 'want to see in the New York Times.'\n\nEmails from Morens uncovered by the committee further revealed that he boasted about having a 'secret back channel' to Fauci where he could clandestinely communicate with the former NIAID director.\n\nThat revelation shocked the committee's chairman Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, so thoroughly that he demanded Fauci turnover his personal email and phone records to the investigative body.\n\nAlso shocking, is Fauci's admission to the committee in January that he 'never' looks at the grants that he signed off on, some of which total to millions of taxpayer dollars.\n\n'You know, technically, I sign off on each council, but I don't see the grants and what they are. I never look at what grants are there,' he told the committee's counsel.", "source": {"uri": "sgtreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SGT Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social distancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Fauci defended himself Monday against claims that he orchestrated a coverup of the coronavirus pandemic's origins, with the former government official rejecting some allegations as \"simply preposterous.\"\n\nThe prominent infectious-disease expert, who served as a senior leader at the National Institutes of Health for four decades before leaving government at the end of 2022, said Republicans have distorted emails between himself and other scientists as they discussed whether a laboratory leak of the coronavirus was possible.\n\n\"We spend our whole life trying to determine the causes of infectious diseases, and stop them to protect the American people,\" Fauci said, adding that he did not pressure colleagues to reach a conclusion about the origins of the virus and disputing other Republican charges.\n\nThe former medical adviser is testifying Monday before the House panel investigating the nation's coronavirus response. The hearing is unfolding amid a battle between the panel's Republican and Democratic leaders over whether its focus on Fauci is necessary to understand the virus's possible origins, or a waste of time that is propagating unproven theories about the pandemic and damaging confidence in public health.\n\nIt is the first time Fauci has faced a GOP-led panel to publicly answer questions about the covid-19 pandemic, which is linked to the deaths of more than 1 million Americans. Leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees U.S. health agencies, also joined the hearing. Fauci privately testified before the lawmakers for 14 hours in January.\n\nThe panel has not found evidence that Fauci led a coverup or that the virus leaked from a laboratory. Most U.S. intelligence entities probing the pandemic favor the theory that the virus emerged naturally, via animal-to-human transmission.\n\n[In the pandemic, we were told to keep 6 feet apart. There wasn't any science to support it.]\n\nRepublicans on Monday pushed on the relationship between Fauci and EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit organization that received funding from Fauci's agency to conduct risky virus research in Wuhan, China. Federal officials halted funding to EcoHealth last month, saying the organization failed to monitor and report on that work. Republicans also focused on David Morens, a former Fauci deputy who deleted emails and took other steps to evade federal records law as he emailed with EcoHealth officials and other colleagues.\n\n\"We have senior officials from your office, in their own writing, discussing breaking federal law, deleting official records and sharing private government information with grant recipients,\" Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio), chairman of the panel, said in prepared remarks. Fauci distanced himself from Morens, saying he \"knew nothing\" about his former colleague's actions regarding EcoHealth or his emails.\n\nDemocrats rallied around Fauci, with Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.), the panel's top Democrat, and others defending the 83-year-old scientist's government service and saying that his work to combat HIV and other viruses saved countless lives in the United States and around the world. Fauci testified that he and his family have faced persistent death threats over allegations that he played a role in sparking the covid-19 pandemic.\n\nRepublicans have \"wasted significant time and taxpayer money\" pursuing conspiracies about the pandemic, said Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.), the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight panel. She called on lawmakers to pivot to other efforts, such as stalled legislation to reauthorize funding for public health preparedness programs. \"It's not too late for Republicans to join us,\" Castor said.\n\nThe hearing with Fauci, widely viewed as the face of America's coronavirus response, drew a circus-style environment to a covid panel that has often struggled for attention as the public has moved on from the pandemic. A line of would-be spectators snaked around the Rayburn House Office Building, seeking a seat in the standing-room-only hearing; a man sitting in the front row wore a T-shirt emblazoned with \"JAIL FAUCI.\"\n\nLawmakers also packed the roster, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), a member of the covid panel who skipped seven of its last 10 hearings.\n\nSome prominent scientists have accused Congress's covid panel of feeding conspiracies and intimidating virologists, saying that Republicans are damaging a workforce that will be needed when the next pandemic inevitably arrives.\n\nBut other outside experts said they understand the panel's questions - even if they don't think there's a covid coverup at the highest levels of government.\n\n\"I don't agree with the tone and sort of breathlessness\" behind Wenstrup and other Republicans' questions, said Holden Thorp, editor of the journal Science. \"At the same time, I think that the scientific community has made a number of mistakes that don't look super good for us all ... [and] that have made it easier for them to make this case.\"\n\nThorp testified before the panel in April about how academic journals had approached their coronavirus coverage and whether officials such as Fauci had pressured them to downplay the lab-leak theory, a charge that Thorp denied. Like many of the coronavirus panel's recent hearings before Monday, it drew scant attention, including from Republicans who had called the hearing; just three of the panel's nine GOP members attended.", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Morens used this private account to communicate with Peter Daszak, a British zoologist whose company conducted research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. In his testimony, Fauci denied using private communications to avoid FOIA, and called Morens's actions \"wrong,\" but admitted that it is \"conceivable\" that he conducted business in emails to Lorens's gmail.\n\nFauci's tenure at NIAID has also been criticized for a lack of transparency for his chief of staff's decision to deliberately misspell words as to avoid FOIA requests. During his testimony, Fauci denied taking part in this avoidance of FOIA requests.\n\nIt is unclear whether Fauci will face prosecution, as called for by Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and Elon Musk; nevertheless, it is notable that the former NIAID head has come under increased scrutiny from Democrats as well as Republicans, particularly following recent admissions that he \"made up\" the social distancing rules and the decision to mask children.", "source": {"uri": "theamericanconservative.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The American Conservative"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mason_letteau_stallings@theamericanconservative.com", "name": "Mason Letteau Stallings", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Wenstrup to Newsmax: Fauci Faces Tough GOP Questions", "body": "Retired Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who served as the public health voice during the COVID-19 pandemic, will face a tough line of questions from the House subcommittee investigating the response, Rep. Brad Wenstrup, its chairman, told Newsmax Sunday.\n\nThe grilling, scheduled for Monday, comes after the transcript from two days of Fauci's closed-door interviews with the subcommittee earlier this year, and the Ohio Republican told Newsmax's \"Sunday Report\" that the hearings revealed several details that need further investigation.\n\n\"During that process, Dr. Fauci said the six feet of distancing just sort of appeared, he said that there was really no science behind the idea of using masks, especially for children,\" Wenstrup said. \"We talked about the mandates that were inflicted upon the American people. Look, I think the vaccine saved hundreds of thousands of lives. But the decision to get a vaccine should be between the doctor and the patient, not mandated.\"\n\nFauci, said Wenstrup, \"has some remorse\" about the mandates, and that \"the American people didn't respond in the way he thought they would.\"\n\nBut \"Americans don't do well with 'because I said so,'\" said Wenstrup. \"There really wasn't much bedside manner. The other thing, too, is why were we mandating that people get vaccinated or they lose their jobs? People were coming across our border by the thousands and they weren't tested and they weren't getting vaccinated.\"\n\nFauci also said during the interviews that there are different definitions for the term gain of function research, said Wenstrup.\n\nBut Dr. Lawrence Tabak, the former acting director of the National Institutes of Health, testified \"more than once that what we were doing was we were funding gain of function research in Wuhan, China,\" said Wenstrup. \"You know what's even worse? This is where their bioweapons program is and this is a dangerous thing to be doing.\"\n\nThe committee will also be asking Fauci about how, although he was the highest-paid person in the federal government, there was a \"huge lack of accountability and responsibility\" when it came to how his position was being run.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in this past month, the committee has heard testimony from EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak and David Morens, a senior adviser who worked closely with Fauci. Daszak, said Wenstrup, was doing gain of function research in China and got grants from Fauci's agency, but \"Dr. Fauci said he never looked at the grants. An advisory board looks at it and then he just signs it.\"\n\nFauci, meanwhile, answered many questions in his prior interviews saying that he didn't remember what happened.\n\n\"In our first day of a transcribed interview, he said that he didn't remember over 170 times,\" said Wenstrup. \"We also found in the emails that Dr. Fauci was using his Gmail, which they were using to avoid the American people seeing what they were writing.\"\n\nSome referrals may need to be made to the Department of Justice, he added, but at the same time, \"there are a lot of places in our agencies where they don't have laws and they need to have laws.\"\n\nNEWSMAX is the fastest-growing cable news channel in America!\n\nFind Newsmax channel in your home via cable and satellite systems - More Info Here Watch Newsmax+ on your home TV app or smartphone and watch it anywhere!

Marjorie Taylor Greene refused to call Dr. Anthony Fauci a doctor.\n\nFauci, who was formerly the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), testified to the House Oversight Committee on Monday. Greene refused to call Fauci \"doctor,\" instead referring to him as \"mister,\" saying he does not deserve the title and that he should be in prison, with members objecting to her choice of words. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: House, Senate Republicans Demand Agencies Terminate Grant Funding To EcoHealth)\n\n\"Mr. Fauci, you were quoted on CBS 'Face the Nation' saying, 'it's easy to criticize, but they're really criticizing science, because I represent science. Do you represent science, Mr. Fauci?\" Greene asked.\n\nFauci declined to give a yes or no answer, leading to a clash, but he asserted he is a scientist.\n\nGreene then brought up how NIAID, under Fauci, directed $424,455 to researchers at the University of Georgia in September 2020 to infect dozens of beagles with disease-causing parasites in order to test an experimental drug on them, according to documents obtained by White Coat Waste Project (WCW) and reviewed by the Daily Caller.\n\n\"I want to tell you this is disgusting and evil, what you signed off on and these experiments that happened to beagles paid for by the American taxpayer, and I want you to know Americans don't pay their taxes for animals to be tortured like this, so this type of science that you are representing, Mr. Fauci, is abhorrent and it needs to stop,\" Greene said.\n\n\"You're not doctor you're Mr. Fauci,\" she added.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland objected to Greene over not calling Fauci a doctor, with Greene protesting.\n\n\"In terms of the rules of decorum, are we allowed to deny that a doctor is a doctor just because we don't want him to be a doctor?\" Raskin asked.\n\n\"Yes, because in my time, that man does not deserve to have a license. As a matter of fact, it should be revoked and he belongs in prison,\" Greene said.\n\nThe hearing then delved into contentiousness with representatives saying Greene's questioning was inappropriate and violated rules, before she continued on.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The NIH, a $49 billion agency that is the foremost source of funding in the world for biomedical research, finds itself under unusual bipartisan scrutiny. The subcommittee has demanded more outside oversight of NIH and its 50,000 grants and raised the idea of term limits for officials like Fauci, who led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, an NIH component, from 1984 to 2022.\n\nLawmakers are likely to put Fauci on the spot about Morens' emails at a time when Republicans are questioning NIH's credibility and integrity. Even Democrats have cautioned the agency's leaders.\n\n\"When people don't trust scientists, they don't trust the science,\" Rep. Deborah Ross (D-N.C.) told Morens.\n\nThe subcommittee has yet to turn up evidence implicating the NIH or U.S. scientists in the pandemic's beginnings in Wuhan, China. Nor has its work shed light on the origin of the virus.\n\nBut in a May 28 letter to NIH Director Monica Bertagnolli, the subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio), said the evidence \"suggests a conspiracy at the highest levels of NIH and NIAID to avoid public transparency regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n\nRep. Jill Tokuda, a subcommittee Democrat from Hawaii, said the evidence shows no such conspiracy. She predicted the bipartisan criticism of Morens, 76, will give way to \"a clash of intentions\" at the hearing as Republicans try to pin covid on Fauci.\n\n\"For them, I think this is their moment to, again, bring a lot of these baseless, false allegations to the front,\" Tokuda said.\n\nOn May 29, Wenstrup asked Fauci to turn over personal e-mails ahead of his testimony.\n\nHere are things to know as the subcommittee gears up for Fauci's appearance.\n\nThe Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic is supposed to be investigating how the pandemic started and the federal government's response. That includes such hot-button issues as vaccination policies and school closures.\n\nA central question is whether the covid virus leaped from animals to humans at a market in Wuhan, China, or spread from a leak at the nearby Wuhan Institute of Virology. The Wuhan lab received funding from an NIH grant recipient called EcoHealth Alliance.\n\nThe congressional probe is in some ways an extension of the nation's political, cultural, and scientific battles arising from the pandemic.\n\nThe Republican-led subcommittee has been examining NIH's performance and that of Fauci, who advised both former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden, becoming the face of many of the government's most polarizing pandemic policies.\n\nThe panel called for the government to cut off EcoHealth's funding, a process the Department of Health and Human Services recently initiated.\n\nEcoHealth's president, Peter Daszak, was Morens' friend and the recipient of many of the emails under scrutiny. A wildlife biologist credited with helping to develop the first covid antiviral drug, remdesivir, Daszak said he and his organization did nothing wrong.\n\n\"We were so accurate in our predictions that a bat coronavirus would emerge from China and cause a pandemic, that when it did, we're dragged in front of the crowd with their pitchforks and blamed for it,\" Daszak said in an interview.\n\nThe Republican-led subcommittee is challenging NIH's credibility. The agency performs and funds a wide variety of medical and scientific research, work that is often the foundation of new medicines and other treatments, and has long enjoyed bipartisan support from Congress. The agency is home to the \"Cancer Moonshot,\" a Biden priority.\n\nAs head of NIAID and a presidential adviser, Fauci helped guide the public during the pandemic on measures to avoid infection, such as mask-wearing and maintaining physical distance.\n\nBut at a May 22 hearing, Wenstrup said Fauci's NIAID \"was, unfortunately, less pristine than so many, including the media, would have had us all believe.\"\n\nIn his letter to Bertagnolli, Wenstrup said there was evidence that a former chief of staff of Fauci's might have used intentional misspellings -- such as a variant of \"EcoHealth\" -- to prevent emails from being captured in keyword searches by FOIA officials.\n\nWenstrup's office did not respond to questions or an interview request.\n\nAn aide to the top Democrat on the subcommittee, Rep. Raul Ruiz of California, said he was unavailable for an interview.\n\nThe emails show a pattern of trying to shield communications from public disclosure.\n\n\"We are all smart enough to know to never have smoking guns, and if we did we wouldn't put them in emails, and if we found them we'd delete them,\" Morens wrote on June 16, 2020.\n\n\"The best way to avoid FOIA hassles is to delete all emails when you learn a subject is getting sensitive,\" he wrote on June 28, 2021.\n\nSome of Morens' emails included sexual or sexist remarks, including one from December 2020: \"Beverage is always good, and best delivered by a blonde nymphomaniac.\" In another email, discussing how former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky got her job, he remarked, \"Well, she does wear a skirt.\"\n\nMorens apologized at the May 22 hearing and called some of what he wrote \"misogynistic.\"\n\n\"Some of the emails I've seen that you all have provided look pretty incriminating,\" he testified.\n\nAsked if he ever sent information related to covid to Fauci's personal email, he said he didn't remember but might have.\n\nMorens said some of his comments were \"snarky jokes\" intended to cheer up his friend Daszak, the EcoHealth president, who was receiving death threats over media coverage of his organization's relationship with the Wuhan lab.\n\nMorens testified that he didn't knowingly delete official records.\n\nRoss, the North Carolina representative, said the emails \"inflict serious damage on public trust for the entire scientific enterprise.\" She said the dangers can be seen in eroding public confidence in vaccines, contributing to recent outbreaks of measles.\n\nRep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) said Morens showed disdain for the Freedom of Information Act. The subcommittee's investigation has been an unfounded effort to pin the blame for the pandemic on NIH and NIAID, and Morens' emails have helped blur the issues, she said.\n\nNo, as Democrats have emphasized.\n\nIn a way, Morens' correspondence undercuts allegations that people at the top of NIAID covered up a lab leak in Wuhan.\n\nNone of Morens' emails describe any effort to suppress evidence of a lab leak and, in an email sent from a private account, he ridiculed the idea, calling it \"false to the point of being crazy.\" But the subcommittee's senior Democrat, Ruiz, criticized Morens for dismissing the lab leak theory.\n\n\"Unless and until we see specific evidence on the origins\" of the virus that causes covid, \"the scientific process requires that we examine all possible hypotheses with objectivity,\" Ruiz said.\n\nKFF Health News senior correspondent Arthur Allen contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "scientificamerican.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scientific American"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Democrats opened the hearing saying the investigation so far has found no evidence that Fauci did anything wrong while missing an important opportunity to prepare for the next scary outbreak.\n\nFauci - alternately a trusted voice during the pandemic and the target of partisan attacks, even death threats - spent 14 hours over two days in January being grilled by the House panel behind closed doors. On Monday, they're questioning him again, in public and on camera for the first time since he ended more than five decades of government service.\n\nThis time around he'll face a new set of questions about the credibility of his former agency, the National Institutes of Health. Last month, the House panel revealed emails from an NIH colleague about ways to evade public records laws, including by not discussing controversial issues on government email.\n\nThe main issue: Many scientists believe the virus most likely emerged in nature and jumped from animals to people, probably at a wildlife market in Wuhan, the city where the outbreak began. There's no new scientific information supporting that the virus might instead have leaked from a laboratory. A U.S. intelligence analysis says there's insufficient evidence to prove either way -- and a recent Associated Press investigation found the Chinese government froze critical efforts to trace the source of the virus in the first weeks of the outbreak.\n\nFauci has long said publicly that he was open to both theories but that there's more evidence supporting COVID-19's natural origins, the way other deadly viruses including coronavirus cousins SARS and MERS jumped into people.\n\n\"I have repeatedly stated that I have a completely open mind to either possibility and that if definitive evidence becomes available to validate or refute either theory, I will ready accept it,\" he said in an opening statement for Monday's hearing.\n\nRepublicans also have accused Fauci of lying to Congress when he denied in May 2022 that his agency funded \"gain of function\" research - the practicing of enhancing a virus in a lab to study its potential real-world impact - at a lab in Wuhan.\n\nNIH for years gave grants to a New York nonprofit called EcoHealth Alliance that used some of the funds to work with a Chinese lab studying coronaviruses commonly carried by bats. Last month, the government suspended federal funding to EcoHealth Alliance - and proposed barring it from future funding - citing its failure to properly monitor some of those experiments.\n\nThe definition of \"gain of function\" covers both general research and especially risky experiments to \"enhance\" the ability of potentially pandemic pathogens to spread or cause severe disease in humans.

On June 3, Americans will have an opportunity to hear directly from Dr. Fauci about his role in overseeing our nation's pandemic response, shaping pandemic-era polices, and promoting singular questionable narratives about the origins of COVID-19,\" committee chairman Brad Wenstrup, an Ohio Republican, said in April.\n\nAmid the hearing on Monday, MAGA supporters took to X, formerly Twitter, to criticize House Republicans for who they say are further abandoning Trump.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Wenstrup and Trump's spokesperson via email and Fauci by emailing Georgetown University, where he now works as a professor, for comment.\n\nLaura Loomer, a far-right activist and staunch Trump ally, took aim at House Republicans for not playing \"offense\" following Trump's criminal hush money trial that was brought forward by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nOn Thursday, a New York jury found the former president guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records relating to a hush money payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels by Trump's then-lawyer Michael Cohen shortly before the 2016 presidential election. Trump has maintained his innocence and says the case is politically motivated. His legal team says they will fight the case, which will include an appeal, if necessary.\n\n\"Get ready to be gaslit today by members of the House GOP @HouseGOP as they use this weeks events to further abandon President Trump and not exercise any accountability and not play offense. It's been 3 days since President Trump was convicted, and yet the Republicans have already found a new shiny object to focus on: Fauci and Hunter Biden,\" Loomer wrote.\n\nLoomer, who pointed to Fauci's hearing and Hunter Biden's federal firearms trial that began on Monday, added that House Republicans \"refuse to do anything\" to help the former president as he continues to campaign amid the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\"Meanwhile, the House GOP and other Republicans could be playing offense in many ways that I am going to be pointing out, but they refuse to do anything that could actually help Donald Trump over these next pivotal 5 months before the general election,\" she wrote.\n\nTrump and President Joe Biden are the presumptive Republican and Democratic presidential nominees respectively following a series of primary wins and are headed for a 2020 election rematch in November. Their first debate is set for June 27, with a second one in September.\n\nIn addition, Steve Bannon's War Room podcast CFO Grace Chong took to X to agree with Loomer, responding with a picture that said, \"Mom come pick me up, the weak men are creating hard times.\"\n\nOther X users and MAGA supporters also agreed with Loomer.\n\nUser Suhr Majesty wrote, \"They won't do nothing for Trump. They're paid opposition.\"\n\nUser Vegas Conservative posted: \"Great leaders create a sense of team, teamwork, and inspire loyalty among those that respect him. They ensure those in their orbit get praise and credit when things are going great, and take personal responsibility when things are not. Poor leaders do none of these things.\"\n\nMeanwhile, according to the committee's press release, Wenstrup concluded his opening statement on Monday by noting that the hearing \"seeks to ensure that federal public health institutions and leaders once again become accountable to the American people.\"\n\nHowever, House Democrats have condemned the investigation into Fauci as Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland told reporters Monday that Fauci \"is not some comic book supervillain.\"\n\n\"What's happening with the Republicans on this committee is a case in point. After using the select subcommittee as a megaphone for outlandish conspiracy theories, House Republicans have once again found themselves in a situation where their own investigation debunks their extreme political rhetoric...this investigation of Dr. Fauci shows that he is an honorable public servant committed to public health,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "natalie_venegas@newsweek.com", "name": "Natalie Venegas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigations_into_the_origin_of_COVID-19", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Investigations into the origin of COVID-19"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Fauci was testifying before the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, a panel investigating the federal response to the pandemic.\n\nFauci, the nation's foremost infectious disease expert, played a major role in shaping the response to the outbreak.

Since then, conservatives have assailed the doctor to the point that he testified that he still receives death threats.\n\nGreene defended her treatment of Fauci, replying to Raskin: \"Yes, because in my time that man does not deserve to have a license. As a matter of fact, it should be revoked, and he belongs in prison.\"\n\nShe later added that Fauci had committed \"crimes against humanity.\"\n\nFauci played a major role in the Trump administration's development of COVID-19 vaccines, which have been found to decrease the risk of hospitalization and death.\n\nRep. Brad Wenstrup of Ohio, the Republican who leads the panel, admonished Greene for her actions.\n\n\"The gentlelady should recognize the doctor as a doctor,\" Wenstrup said.\n\nRep. Robert Garcia of California, Democrat who spoke immediately after Greene, apologized to Fauci who how he was treated.\n\n\"Quite frankly -- this might be the most insane hearing I've ever attended, and I've only been in Congress for a year and a half,\" Garcia said. \"I'm so sorry that you are subjected to those levels of attacks.\"\n\nGreene, a close ally of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, has returned to her roots of challenging GOP leadership and upending House hearings with her questions.

Fauci, though he hedged his answer, failed to provide a specific example of a study he viewed supporting child masking. He suggested that he may not have looked at any data at all.\n\n\"Do you recall reviewing any studies or data supporting masking for children?\" GOP counsel asked, according to the transcript.\n\nFauci responded, \"You know, I might have, Mitch, but I don't recall specifically that I did. I might have.\"\n\nThe counsel then pointed to studies and data from the pandemic that suggest masking harmed child development and education.\n\n\"There's been a lot of studies that have come out since the pandemic started, but specifically on this there have been significant on, kind of like the learning loss and speech and development issues that have been associated with particularly young children wearing masks while they're growing up. They can't see their teacher talk and can't learn how to form words. Have you followed any of those studies?\" the counsel asked.\n\n\"No,\" Fauci answered. He went on to say he believes the scientific data on child masking is still mixed.\n\n\"I believe that there are a lot of conflicting studies too, that there are those that say, yes, there is an impact, and there are those that say there's not. I still think that's up in the air,\" he said. \"I mean, I'm very sensitive to children. I have children and I have grandchildren. So, I don't want to have anything that would do to harm them [sic]. But I think that there was a conflicting discussion about the negative impact on speech and formation of the bones of the face, and that I think was debunked pretty easily.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

The playground has a big warning sign that tells parents not to keep the kids there for more than 30 minutes, to wash their hands, don't feed them, to make sure they wear masks and... maintain a 6-foot distance from other kids. (Good luck with that.)\n\nAt the pharmacy, the old 'feet' stickers on the floor mark what was supposed to be the old 6 foot personal DMZ.\n\nObviously no one (or hardly anyone) abides by these rules anymore and the whole thing feels a bit unreal, like a strange movie we saw or an odd dream we had, and yet millions lived under this totalitarian system. (It's as if we had a year where we were suddenly living in the USSR and then the whole thing fell apart like a Cold War at hyperspeed.)\n\nWhere did that 6-foot social distancing thing even come from? Apparently, like so much else, the Department of Trust the Science just made it up.\n\nTrust Fauci.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci said in congressional testimony that he reviewed no scientific evidence behind the specific recommendations for masking children or maintaining 6-foot social distancing before advocating these policies during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhen asked about social distancing recommendations that were implemented in businesses and schools during the early stages of the pandemic, Fauci said he did not recall where the precise number of 6 feet came from.\n\n\"It just sort of appeared,\" Fauci said in his interview. \"I don't recall, like, a discussion of whether it should be 5 or 6 or whatever.\"\n\nFauci also said that he had not seen any scientific study supporting the measurement, noting that such a study would be \"very difficult\" to do with accuracy and scientific rigor.\n\nThe Science Squad would make stuff up to suit the needs of the moment. Much like masking which Fauci was against before he was for.\n\nThe 6 feet rule was just something that sounded good to tell the proles.\n\nFauci, much as people hate him, was a symptom. The problem is that a whole lot of public health and D.C. works this way. As does a sizable chunk of public-facing medical science. Tell people something that sounds authoritative to get to do what you really want them to do. The goal is to get people to stay apart so tell them to wear masks and follow some arbitrary measure of social distancing while acting like there's science behind it.\n\nAnd there never was.\n\nThe wizard behind the curtain was always a humbug. In the face of mass panic, little big men like Fauci would throw their weight around while exploiting that panic. They claimed to embody science when all they embodied was power.", "source": {"uri": "frontpagemag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FrontPage Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_greenfield@frontpagemag.com", "name": "Daniel Greenfield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

(Anna Rose Layden/Pool/Getty Images/TNS)\n\nFormer National Institutes of Health official Anthony Fauci has faced many hostile questions from members of Congress, but when he appears before a House panel on Monday, he'll have something new to answer for: a trove of incendiary emails written by one of his closest advisers.\n\nIn the emails, David Morens, a career federal scientist now on administrative leave, described deleting messages and using a personal email account to evade disclosure of correspondence under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\n\"i learned from our foia lady here how to make emails disappear after i am foia'd but before the search starts, so i think we are all safe,\" Morens wrote in a Feb. 24, 2021, email. \"Plus i deleted most of those earlier emails after sending them to gmail.\"\n\nThe pressure is on as Fauci himself prepares to appear June 3 before a House subcommittee exploring the origins of covid-19. The NIH, a $49 billion agency that is the foremost source of funding in the world for biomedical research, finds itself under unusual bipartisan scrutiny. The subcommittee has demanded more outside oversight of NIH and its 50,000 grants and raised the idea of term limits for officials like Fauci, who led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, an NIH component, from 1984 to 2022.\n\nLawmakers are likely to put Fauci on the spot about Morens' emails at a time when Republicans are questioning NIH's credibility and integrity. Even Democrats have cautioned the agency's leaders.\n\n\"When people don't trust scientists, they don't trust the science,\" Rep. Deborah Ross, D-N.C., told Morens.\n\nThe subcommittee has yet to turn up evidence implicating the NIH or U.S. scientists in the pandemic's beginnings in Wuhan, China. Nor has its work shed light on the origin of the virus.\n\nBut in a May 28 letter to NIH Director Monica Bertagnolli, the subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio), said the evidence \"suggests a conspiracy at the highest levels of NIH and NIAID to avoid public transparency regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n\nRep. Jill Tokuda, a subcommittee Democrat from Hawaii, said the evidence shows no such conspiracy. She predicted the bipartisan criticism of Morens, 76, will give way to \"a clash of intentions\" at the hearing as Republicans try to pin covid on Fauci.\n\n\"For them, I think this is their moment to, again, bring a lot of these baseless, false allegations to the front,\" Tokuda said.\n\nOn May 29, Wenstrup asked Fauci to turn over personal e-mails ahead of his testimony.\n\nHere are things to know as the subcommittee gears up for Fauci's appearance.\n\nWhat Is the subcommittee looking For?\n\nThe Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic is supposed to be investigating how the pandemic started and the federal government's response. That includes such hot-button issues as vaccination policies and school closures.\n\nA central question is whether the covid virus leaped from animals to humans at a market in Wuhan, China, or spread from a leak at the nearby Wuhan Institute of Virology. The Wuhan lab received funding from an NIH grant recipient called EcoHealth Alliance.\n\nThe congressional probe is in some ways an extension of the nation's political, cultural, and scientific battles arising from the pandemic.\n\nThe Republican-led subcommittee has been examining NIH's performance and that of Fauci, who advised both former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden, becoming the face of many of the government's most polarizing pandemic policies.\n\nThe panel called for the government to cut off EcoHealth's funding, a process the Department of Health and Human Services recently initiated.\n\nEcoHealth's president, Peter Daszak, was Morens' friend and the recipient of many of the emails under scrutiny. A wildlife biologist credited with helping to develop the first covid antiviral drug, remdesivir, Daszak said he and his organization did nothing wrong.\n\n\"We were so accurate in our predictions that a bat coronavirus would emerge from China and cause a pandemic, that when it did, we're dragged in front of the crowd with their pitchforks and blamed for it,\" Daszak said in an interview.\n\nWhat's at stake for NIH?\n\nThe Republican-led subcommittee is challenging NIH's credibility. The agency performs and funds a wide variety of medical and scientific research, work that is often the foundation of new medicines and other treatments, and has long enjoyed bipartisan support from Congress. The agency is home to the \" Cancer Moonshot,\" a Biden priority.\n\nAs head of NIAID and a presidential adviser, Fauci helped guide the public during the pandemic on measures to avoid infection, such as mask-wearing and maintaining physical distance.\n\nBut at a May 22 hearing, Wenstrup said Fauci's NIAID \"was, unfortunately, less pristine than so many, including the media, would have had us all believe.\"\n\nIn his letter to Bertagnolli, Wenstrup said there was evidence that a former chief of staff of Fauci's might have used intentional misspellings -- such as a variant of \"EcoHealth\" -- to prevent emails from being captured in keyword searches by FOIA officials.\n\nWenstrup's office did not respond to questions or an interview request.\n\nAn aide to the top Democrat on the subcommittee, Rep. Raul Ruiz of California, said he was unavailable for an interview.\n\nWhy were Morens' emails alarming?\n\nThe emails show a pattern of trying to shield communications from public disclosure.\n\n\"We are all smart enough to know to never have smoking guns, and if we did we wouldn't put them in emails, and if we found them we'd delete them,\" Morens wrote on June 16, 2020.\n\n\"The best way to avoid FOIA hassles is to delete all emails when you learn a subject is getting sensitive,\" he wrote on June 28, 2021.\n\nMorens apologized at the May 22 hearing and called some of what he wrote \"misogynistic.\"\n\n\"Some of the emails I've seen that you all have provided look pretty incriminating,\" he testified.\n\nAsked if he ever sent information related to covid to Fauci's personal email, he said he didn't remember but might have.\n\nMorens said some of his comments were \"snarky jokes\" intended to cheer up his friend Daszak, the EcoHealth president, who was receiving death threats over media coverage of his organization's relationship with the Wuhan lab.\n\nMorens testified that he didn't knowingly delete official records.\n\nRoss, the North Carolina representative, said the emails \"inflict serious damage on public trust for the entire scientific enterprise.\" She said the dangers can be seen in eroding public confidence in vaccines, contributing to recent outbreaks of measles.\n\nRep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) said Morens showed disdain for the Freedom of Information Act. The subcommittee's investigation has been an unfounded effort to pin the blame for the pandemic on NIH and NIAID, and Morens' emails have helped blur the issues, she said.\n\nIn a way, Morens' correspondence undercuts allegations that people at the top of NIAID covered up a lab leak in Wuhan.\n\nNone of Morens' emails describe any effort to suppress evidence of a lab leak and, in an email sent from a private account, he ridiculed the idea, calling it \"false to the point of being crazy.\" But the subcommittee's senior Democrat, Ruiz, criticized Morens for dismissing the lab leak theory.\n\n\"Unless and until we see specific evidence on the origins\" of the virus that causes covid, \"the scientific process requires that we examine all possible hypotheses with objectivity,\" Ruiz said.\n\nKFF Health News senior correspondent Arthur Allen contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stars and Stripes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

He served as the Director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) during 1984-2022. As the NIAID Director, he became a leading figure in issuing public guidance and shaping popular opinion through the thick of the Covid-19 pandemic. Critics, however, have long sought to grill Fauci on his role in the gain of function (GOF) research conducted in China with American grants and assistance that's suspected of having set off the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe GOF research refers to the kind of research that gives a pathogen -- bacteria or virus -- characteristics that it does not naturally has. Usually, such characteristics include increased transmissibility or severity.\n\nThe Monday's testimony will be Fauci's first since he retired from his public roles in 2022. Previously, he gave two seven-hour-long closed-door interviews to the Select Subcommittee.\n\nFauci accused of lying about GOF research\n\nFauci has been accused of lying about his role in funding GOF research in China.\n\nThe NIAID gave multiple grants to a non-profit EcoHealth Alliance that further distributed it to Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) and the Wuhan University Center for Animal Experiment (WUCAE) in China for GOF research, as per the US government documents and communication accessed under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) by The Intercept.\n\nBefore these documents released publicly, Fauci had told the US Congress \"NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology\". The NIH refers to the US government's National Institutes of Health which includes many health institutes including NIAID. The Intercept's findings showed that Fauci's claim was not correct.\n\nIt has also been reported that, in the initial days of the Covid-19 pandemic, Fauci met with Ralph Baric, an American scientist who is longtime collaborator with WIV on GOF research. US Right to Know in a report said that while Fauci could have met Baric just over his expertise in coronaviruses, there is evidence that he has not been forthcoming about his concerns regarding WIV's activities with regard to Covid-origin.\n\n\"Together the emails suggest Fauci has not disclosed the depth of his concerns about the Wuhan lab and its connection to the research enterprise he steered for decades,\" said the report, adding that Fauci dispatched aides to learn about grants to WIV soon after the pandemic was reported.\n\n\"Fauci was alerted in late January [2020] that the genome of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, betrayed signs of engineering. A small group of virologists circulated a paper coauthored by Baric and Shi describing a SARSr-CoV experiment that employed engineering. Fauci immediately dispatched an aide to interrogate whether his institute, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had any connection to the study,\" said the report.\n\nWhat do we know of Covid-origin?\n\nAfter more than four years of the first emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19 disease, there is no conclusive evidence of how the virus first emerged. While the belief that it jumped naturally from an animal -- bats, most likely -- to humans was the mainstream belief initially, the lack of any conclusive evidence for the same even after four years has challenged it.\n\nOn the other hand, an increasing body of scientists, journalists, and other experts have built a circumstantial case for a lab-origin of Covid-19. As per them, the evidence suggests that the virus could have leaked from a lab in Wuhan -- the WIV -- in an accident. Now, it is known that scientists at the WIV were indulging in GOF research on coronaviruses for several years and one of these viruses has been found to be close ancestors of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nWIV's Shi Zhengli, popularly known as the 'batwoman' for her work on bat coronaviruses, carried out research on coronaviruses for years with US collaborators and grants. With EcoHealth Alliance's Peter Daszak, she collected 630 types of coronaviruses between 2010 and 2015 and also collaborated with Baric, a specialist of GOF whom Fauci also met.\n\nIn 2015, Baric and Shi published a paper in which they detailed how they fused a bat coronavirus and a human coronavirus. The resultant virus could infect mice as well as humans, as per the paper. It meant that they gave new infectious properties to viruses that were not originally there.\n\nThe fact that the Chinese scientists were researching coronaviruses and carrying out GOF research, including the closest-known ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 called RaTG13 for years, has led to an increasing body of experts to say that it's likely that the virus could have escaped from the lab. The WIV is next to the location in Wuhan where the first publicly-known outbreak was reported.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Brand Wenstrup (R-Ohio) said in an exclusive interview Thursday. \"But at the same time, we can make criminal referrals. I think we should.\"\n\nThe House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic has already recommended a criminal probe of Dr. Peter Daszak, the disgraced president of Manhattan-based EcoHealth Alliance, which received millions in US grants that helped fund experiments on modified bat coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV).\n\nThe panel has also unearthed shocking formation about the origins of SARS-CoV-2, the failures of the US pandemic response and taxpayer-funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan, China -- the city where the virus emerged more than four years ago.\n\n\"The work they were doing was risky,\" the chairman noted of the Wuhan experiments, \"and, you can see through reverse engineering, was capable of creating something like COVID-19.\"\n\n\"I started looking at this when we were in lockdown in 2020, through the [House] Intelligence Committee, and what creating a chimera was all about, and what gain-of-function research was about, and it kind of frightened me as far as bioweapons and that's a new threat going into the future,\" added Wenstrup, who is also a doctor and retired US Army colonel.\n\nIn a shocking trove of emails obtained by the subcommittee, Fauci's former senior adviser at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Dr. David Morens, admitted to using a private account to evade Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests about EcoHealth's Wuhan grant, claimed he deleted records related to it -- and said he helped his boss to do the same through a \"secret back channel.\"\n\n\"At one point, Dr. Morens said that he never talked to Tony Fauci about the Wuhan Institute of Virology and EcoHealth Alliance,\" Wenstrup said in reference to Morens' congressional testimony of May 22, in which he confirmed the emails were sent but dismissed them as \"jokes.\"\n\n\"But he did do that, and we have the proof of that now, and he talks about how he did,\" he added of the more than 30,000 records Morens handed over.\n\nWhen asked whether Fauci's two-day transcribed interview from January with the COVID subcommittee also included false claims about not being \"involved\" in EcoHealth's funding of gain-of-function research, Wenstrup would only say: \"Somebody's not telling the truth.\"\n\nFauci, 83, said at the time that he did not \"recall any specific interaction\" with Daszak before the pandemic -- and denied having \"back-and-forth discussions\" with EcoHealth's president.\n\nBut the Morens emails reveal the ex-Biden White House medical adviser expressing \"concern\" for Daszak and the suspension of EcoHealth's research grant.\n\n\"Peter, from Tony's numerous recent comments to me, and from what Francis has been vocal about over the past 5 days, they are trying to protect you, which also protects their own reputations,\" Morens wrote to Daszak on Oct. 25, 2021, just days after a National Institutes of Health (NIH) official disclosed to Congress that EcoHealth violated its grant terms for WIV.\n\n\"I had face to face meetings with Tony to discuss science issues,\" Morens also said in a Nov. 18, 2021, email. \"He asked how Peter was doing, as he often does, and seemed to commiserate with him to a degree.\"\n\nWenstrup said the subcommittee had \"a lot of questions\" for Fauci -- and has requested his private email and cell phone records -- based on disclosures about high-level discussions to hide and allegedly destroy records critical to investigating the origins of COVID.\n\nThe NIH funneled more than half a million in taxpayer dollars to WIV for a project titled \"Understanding the Risk of Bat Coronavirus Emergence\" between 2014 and 2021, according to a Government Accountability Office report released last year.\n\nThe project included \"genetic experiments to combine naturally occurring bat coronaviruses with SARS and MERS viruses, resulting in hybridized (also known as chimeric) coronavirus strains.\"\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General determined that the research on lab mice resulted in a modified virus that was 10,000 times more infectious, which EcoHealth failed to report.\n\nA June 2023 report from the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence also found that WIV was conducting pathogens research between 2017 and 2019 \"for defensive and biosecurity needs of the [Chinese] military.\"\n\nNIH principal deputy director Dr. Lawrence Tabak testified to the House COVID subcommittee in May that the experiments constituted gain-of-function research -- the first agency official to have publicly said so since more than 1.1 million Americans have been killed by the virus.\n\nHHS last year barred WIV from receiving US funding for the next 10 years, and proposed Daszak and his organization for debarment for the next three years, citing its failure to report the research results and adhere to appropriate biosafety levels.\n\nIn previous congressional testimony, Fauci and former NIH director Dr. Francis Collins repeatedly denied that the research occurred, and the agency in 2021 replaced a long-held definition of the term on its webpage.\n\nFauci even published a scientific paper in 2012 describing a remarkably similar chain of events to those that some members of the US intelligence community, scientific experts, former federal officials and members of Congress have suggested led to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"Putting aside the specter of bioterrorism for the moment, consider this hypothetical scenario: an important gain-of-function experiment involving a virus with serious pandemic potential is performed in a well-regulated, world-class laboratory by experienced investigators, but the information from the experiment is then used by another scientist who does not have the same training and facilities and is not subject to the same regulations,\" Fauci wrote in a paper titled \"Research on Highly Pathogenic H5N1 Influenza Virus: The Way Forward.\"\n\n\"In an unlikely but conceivable turn of events, what if that scientist becomes infected with the virus, which leads to an outbreak and ultimately triggers a pandemic?\" he asked. \"Many ask reasonable questions: given the possibility of such a scenario -- however remote -- should the initial experiments have been performed and/or published in the first place, and what were the processes involved in this decision?\"\n\n\"Scientists working in this field might say -- as indeed I have said -- that the benefits of such experiments and the resulting knowledge outweigh the risks,\" he concluded.\n\nWhile Tabak has stressed that the viral sequences that emerged from the \"Understanding the Risk of Bat Coronavirus Emergence\" were \"genetically very distant\" from COVID-19, another EcoHealth proposal has been cited as \"smoking gun\" evidence that the virus was engineered in Wuhan.\n\nThat grant proposal, known as Project DEFUSE, was not funded -- but in early drafts and notes on it obtained by US Right to Know, Daszak said he would \"downplay\" the involvement of a researcher at the Wuhan lab when asking for federal funding.\n\nIn his own testimony before Wenstrup's committee, Daszak admitted that EcoHealth had not received any genomic sequences of viruses from WIV since before the pandemic.\n\nWenstrup told The Post he has not seen \"nearly any evidence\" that the coronavirus emerged from nature, while adding that \"there's a lot we'll never know because of the Chinese.\"\n\nSoon after assuming chairmanship of the subcommittee, Wenstrup said the Chinese embassy in Washington sent him a letter saying that they had \"grave concerns\" about him investigating the origins of COVID.\n\nThe FBI, Energy Department and former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Robert Redfield have all pointed to an accidental lab leak as the most likely explanation for the pandemic -- with former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe calling it the \"only\" explanation.\n\nFauci in his closed-door interview with the House subcommittee acknowledged that the lab leak theory was not a \"conspiracy\" -- despite having prompted a scientific paper in February 2020 to disprove it, which he then cited in a White House press briefing to dismiss concerns.\n\n\"I don't know that anyone in the White House or in the general public knew that he had coordinated to have that paper written,\" Wenstrup pointed out, saying the ex-NIAID head testified to having \"never looked at any of the scientific research and papers that talked about how this could be made in a lab.\"\n\n\"We were learning some through intelligence that has been declassified,\" he added. \"They had problems with leaks and the type of work that the Chinese government was doing, as well as what EcoHealth Alliance was doing -- and we were funding it.\"\n\nWhile Wenstrup remains unconvinced the US could ever definitely prove the origins of COVID-19 without Chinese cooperation, he is calling for harsher penalties for public health bureaucrats who break the rules.\n\n\"I'm a soldier, served 25 years,\" said the Ohioan, who received a Bronze Star for his work as a combat surgeon during the Iraq War.\n\nAgencies and military branches under the Pentagon umbrella are the only places in Washington \"where unethical is unlawful,\" he claimed.\n\n\"I think we have to set a higher standard for people that work within our agencies,\" Wenstrup affirmed. \"They may have standards on paper, but what happens when you don't adhere to them, like we saw with the [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act] court?\"\n\n\"So now we have criminal liabilities built in,\" he said in reference to the recent congressional reauthorization of the government's spying authorities, \"and I think we need to do that probably in every agency.\"\n\n\"In this case, with Dr. Fauci, he didn't seem to have much oversight over the billions of dollars that he was OKing to go out the door.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, whether denying Fauci's position coincided with committee decorum.\n\n\"Yes,\" Rep. Greene answered. \"Because in my time that man does not deserve to have a license. As a matter of fact, it should be revoked and he belongs in prison.\"\n\n\"Is this what we have become?\" Rep. Raskin asked. \"Is this what we have devolved into? No decorum.\"\n\nREAD MORE | Ohio Republican slams Fauci over pandemic policies: 'Americans were aggressively bullied'\n\nThe argument sparked calls to have Rep. Greene's words taken down. Rep.

Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, at a meeting of the House Oversight Committee earlier this month. Video of the altercation went viral on social media, including Rep. Crockett's characterization of Rep.

There's No Science To Support That.\n\n\"It sort of just appeared, that six feet is going to be the distance,\" Fauci testified to Congress in a January closed-door hearing, according to a transcribed interview released Friday. Dr. Anthony Fauci characterized the recommendation as \"an empiric decision that wasn't based on data.\" Francis S. Collins, former director of the National Institutes of Health, also privately testified to Congress in January that he was not aware of evidence behind the social distancing recommendation, according to a transcript released in May.

So-called \"duckbill\" N95 masks scored highest in the study, which measured the exhaled breath of participants who were tested both masked and unmasked to measure comparative outputs of SARS-CoV-2. The inexpensive masks, which have two head straps and a horizontal seam, captured 98% of exhaled virus, according to the study published in eBioMedicine.

These are payments made by private companies, like pharmaceuticals, to license medical innovations from government scientists.\n\nAlmost all that cash -- $690 million -- went to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), the subagency led by Dr. Anthony Fauci, and 260 of its scientists.\n\nInformation about this vast private royalty complex is tightly held by NIH. My organization, OpenTheBooks.com, was forced to sue to uncover the royalties paid from September 2009 to October 2021, which amounted to $325 million over 56,000 transactions.\n\nWe had to sue a second time, with Judicial Watch as our counsel, to pry open this new release.\n\nPayments skyrocketed during the pandemic era: those years saw more than double the amount of cash flow to NIH from the private sector, compared to the prior twelve combined. All told, it's $1.036 billion.\n\nIt's unclear if any of the Covid vaccine royalties from Pfizer and Moderna, the latter of which settled with NIH by agreeing to pay $400 million, is even included in these new numbers. NIH isn't saying.\n\nThe American people have one last crack at getting some candor from Fauci, the face of our COVID response, when he testifies Monday before the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic.\n\nThere's plenty to answer for.\n\nHe's spent years scoffing at questions about potential conflicts of interest between COVID policymakers, who relentlessly pushed vaccines, and recipients of private royalties.\n\nNow he'll also need to account for bombshell emails sent by one of his deputies, which described in-house strategies to circumvent the federal Freedom of Information Act.\n\nFauci won't be able to misspell words to evade scrutiny or have folks physically courier messages -- just two of the FOIA-avoiding actions described by Dr. David Morens, a key Fauci deputy.\n\nInstead, cameras from around the world will be trained on Fauci and he'll be answering for information he gave in a sworn deposition earlier this year.\n\nIt's a chance to either come clean or further cement the public's perception of him and the NIH as secretive and self-interested.\n\nBeyond this small cabal of scientists covering up discussions of the virus' origin, NIH has consistently treated FOIA requests like viral attacks of their own. No wonder, then, that we're plaintiffs in six ongoing FOIA cases.\n\nCharacteristically, NIH is still redacting pieces of the data that would help us more easily connect therapeutics with their government-paid inventors. For example, they refuse to show us the amount of royalties paid to each individual scientist. So we still can't entirely follow the money.\n\nIn the meantime, Sen. Rand Paul has sponsored the Royalty Transparency Act, which sailed unanimously through the committee process and deserves a floor vote immediately.\n\nThere's plenty Fauci could do in the meantime, too. He could indicate he supports bills like Paul's. He could call on NIH and CDC to voluntarily \"unmask\" the royalty payments. Then we could see whether their decisions have advanced the general welfare or their own.\n\nFauci could also support fixes to the FOIA law that create real consequences for those who purposely violate it.\n\nAt minimum, he must apologize for the utter contempt for FOIA, and the transparency war waged by his colleagues that's now been revealed in private communications.\n\nAmong the government's most basic duties to the public are providing for the general welfare and reporting its income and spending.\n\nAs Dr. Fauci wraps five decades in government having become its highest-paid bureaucrat, he should consider ticking those boxes again.

The Texas Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit that sought to clarify exceptions to the state's abortion laws. But first ...\n\nThe longtime infectious-disease expert is back on Capitol Hill, though today marks a first: He's no longer a government official.\n\nThe 83-year-old Fauci left the National Institutes of Health at the end of 2022, but he's remained a target for Republicans -- particularly the House select subcommittee on the coronavirus pandemic, which is running today's hearing.\n\nThe GOP-led panel has been investigating whether federal officials tried to hide U.S. ties with researchers in Wuhan, China, where the outbreak was first detected, and other issues they say were ignored by Democrats.\n\nFauci has repeatedly denied allegations of a coverup -- including in 14 hours of private testimony before the covid panel in January -- or any knowledge of a lab leak that sparked the pandemic. Most U.S. intelligence entities probing the pandemic favor the theory that the virus emerged naturally, via animal-to-human transmission.\n\nHere are four questions on my mind ahead of today's hearing, which is scheduled to start at 10 a.m.:\n\n1. Can Republicans link Fauci to his colleagues' mistakes? The covid panel has uncovered problems such as EcoHealth Alliance, which was funded by NIH, failing to monitor and report on risky virus research in China. The panel also previously grilled David Morens, a former Fauci deputy who bragged about deleting emails and evading federal records laws. Expect both EcoHealth and Morens to be at the heart of today's hearing.\n\nThe panel has also focused on challenges in the broader pandemic response, such as Fauci's admission in January that he wasn't aware of any data behind the six-foot social distancing rule. But the social distancing rule was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, despite misleading media coverage that has claimed Fauci \"made up\" the rule.\n\n2. Will Democrats get upset with Fauci? Democrats lashed out at Peter Daszak, EcoHealth's president, and Morens in recent hearings. But they've taken pains to try to protect Fauci himself, saying none of the findings implicate him or confirm a lab leak.\n\nThe recent hearing with Morens was \"not a breakthrough moment in actually understanding the actual origins of the covid-19 pandemic,\" said Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.), the panel's top Democrat.\n\n3. Is this hearing doing any harm? I wrote a long story over the weekend about how panel chair Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio) and Ruiz -- fellow doctors and the panel's leaders -- were at odds over their investigations. Wenstrup believes there was harm done by belittling the lab-leak theory and other controversial questions; Ruiz believes focusing on officials like Fauci is backfiring by hurting confidence in public health.\n\nThe public health community sides with Ruiz.\n\n\"Public health officials are public servants, not public enemies, and we must do more to protect and support public health officials at all levels of government,\" Joseph Kanter, the CEO of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, wrote to the panel ahead of today's hearing. More than 90 groups also signed a separate letter warning about pandemic-linked harassment.\n\n4. How much will the broader public even care? Apathy, rather than partisan politics, may be the biggest threat to the covid panel's work. Polls by KFF, a nonpartisan health think tank, show covid barely rates as an election-year issue.\n\nSome of the covid panel's own members have also appeared to lose interest. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) has skipped seven of the last 10 hearings, by my count. (When I asked Greene about her flagging attendance, she said the panel needed to focus more on vaccines.)\n\nBut conservative media, at least, has helped bring covid back in the news. When I stopped by Wenstrup's office last month, a TV tuned to Fox News was airing a segment about Fauci's adviser deleting emails -- and when I left Wenstrup's office about 40 minutes later, Fox News had pivoted to another segment on the topic.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Moderna was one of two companies to make coronavirus vaccines using messenger RNA technology, which delivers a strip of genetic material called RNA, encased in a fat bubble, to a person's cells. Since then, the company deployed the same technology to manufacture an RSV shot.\n\nLast year, two companies -- GSK and Pfizer -- received FDA approval for their shots for respiratory syncytial virus for older adults, which marked a turning point in a six-decade-long quest to protect vulnerable people against the virus. The Pfizer shot also can be given to pregnant people to protect newborns from RSV.\n\nThe details: Sponsor Lykos Therapeutics conducted two late-stage clinical trials showing significant improvement in PTSD symptoms among patients treated with MDMA. However, the FDA noted in its review that the psychedelic effects of MDMA probably revealed to participants whether they received the drug or placebo, potentially biasing their expectations and affecting results.\n\nThe FDA also flagged safety concerns, including risks to cardiovascular health, liver function and potential abuse of MDMA. And it criticized Lykos for failing to collect data on abuse-related effects like euphoria or elated mood, which could indicate abuse risk.\n\nThe view from Lykos: CEO Amy Emerson said the company stands by the quality and integrity of its research and development.\n\nNext steps: The review comes ahead of an FDA advisory committee meeting this week to discuss Lykos's data on its MDMA-assisted therapy. If approved, the drug would be the first psychedelic treatment to win the agency's green light.\n\nTexas Supreme Court upholds abortion ban\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the state's near-total abortion ban Friday, ruling against a group of 20 women who say they were denied medically necessary care because of the law.\n\nIn a unanimous decision, the all-Republican court upheld a narrow interpretation of the ban, allowing abortions only for pregnant patients facing a life-threatening condition \"before death or serious physical impairment are imminent.\"\n\nThe ruling reversed a temporary injunction issued by a lower court last summer allowing Texans with \"unsafe\" pregnancies or fatal fetal diagnosis to receive an abortion if their doctor made a \"good faith judgment\" that it was necessary.\n\nThe Post's David Ovalle sends this note:\n\nAdvocacy groups are urging the federal government to approve requests from 19 states to allow Medicaid coverage for medications to treat opioid addiction for jail and prison inmates.\n\nIn a letter scheduled to be sent today to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, the 97 organizations asked requests be granted \"to save lives and help vulnerable communities.\"\n\nKey context: Inmates are vulnerable to addiction and overdoses behind bars and after release when their opioid tolerance is low. People with opioid use disorder are often prescribed buprenorphine and methadone, which stave off opioid withdrawals and reduce cravings -- but most correctional facilities do not offer the medications.\n\nThe Biden administration has moved to expand access to medications. Last year, CMS announced it would allow states to request coverage for eligible inmates who are up to 90 days away from release.\n\nOnly California, Washington, Massachusetts and Montana have been granted the expanded Medicaid coverage.\u00ad In April, members of Congress sent a similar letter to CMS urging waiver approvals. A CMS spokesperson said the agency is working with states to review requests.\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 Welcome back, Congress! The House and Senate are both in session starting today.

Huge sums of cash were funnelled to Fauci's team by Big Pharma companies to license experimental medicines such as mRNA.\n\nAlmost all that funnelled money -- $690 million -- went to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), the subagency led by Fauci and his small team.\n\nNypost.com reports: Information about this vast private royalty complex is tightly held by NIH. My organization, OpenTheBooks.com, was forced to sue to uncover the royalties paid from September 2009 to October 2021, which amounted to $325 million over 56,000 transactions.\n\nWe had to sue a second time, with Judicial Watch as our counsel, to pry open this new release.\n\nPayments skyrocketed during the pandemic era: those years saw more than double the amount of cash flow to NIH from the private sector, compared to the prior twelve combined. All told, it's $1.036 billion.\n\nIt's unclear if any of the Covid vaccine royalties from Pfizer and Moderna, the latter of which settled with NIH by agreeing to pay $400 million, is even included in these new numbers. NIH isn't saying.\n\nThe American people have one last crack at getting some candor from Fauci, the face of our COVID response, when he testifies Monday before the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic.\n\nThere's plenty to answer for.\n\nHe's spent years scoffing at questions about potential conflicts of interest between COVID policymakers, who relentlessly pushed vaccines, and recipients of private royalties.\n\nNow he'll also need to account for bombshell emails sent by one of his deputies, which described in-house strategies to circumvent the federal Freedom of Information Act.\n\nFauci won't be able to misspell words to evade scrutiny or have folks physically courier messages -- just two of the FOIA-avoiding actions described by Dr. David Morens, a key Fauci deputy.\n\nInstead, cameras from around the world will be trained on Fauci and he'll be answering for information he gave in a sworn deposition earlier this year.\n\nIt's a chance to either come clean or further cement the public's perception of him and the NIH as secretive and self-interested.\n\nBeyond this small cabal of scientists covering up discussions of the virus' origin, NIH has consistently treated FOIA requests like viral attacks of their own. No wonder, then, that we're plaintiffs in six ongoing FOIA cases.\n\nCharacteristically, NIH is still redacting pieces of the data that would help us more easily connect therapeutics with their government-paid inventors. For example, they refuse to show us the amount of royalties paid to each individual scientist. So we still can't entirely follow the money.\n\nIn the meantime, Sen. Rand Paul has sponsored the Royalty Transparency Act, which sailed unanimously through the committee process and deserves a floor vote immediately.\n\nThere's plenty Fauci could do in the meantime, too. He could indicate he supports bills like Paul's. He could call on NIH and CDC to voluntarily \"unmask\" the royalty payments. Then we could see whether their decisions have advanced the general welfare or their own.\n\nFauci could also support fixes to the FOIA law that create real consequences for those who purposely violate it.\n\nAt minimum, he must apologize for the utter contempt for FOIA, and the transparency war waged by his colleagues that's now been revealed in private communications.\n\nAmong the government's most basic duties to the public are providing for the general welfare and reporting its income and spending.", "source": {"uri": "thepeoplesvoice.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "The People's Voice"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_adl_tabatabai@thepeoplesvoice.tv", "name": "Sean Adl-Tabatabai", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

The hearing -- focused on the U.S.'s COVID-19 response -- could get fiery, as Republicans vow to grill the public health expert who has become a boogeyman on the right.\n\nOn the House floor, lawmakers will consider legislation to sanction International Criminal Court officials after the ICC requested arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli and Hamas leaders. The lower chamber will also vote on the first of 12 appropriations bills for fiscal year 2025.\n\nOn the other side of the Capitol, senators will vote on a bill to protect access to contraceptives, as Democrats seek to highlight reproductive rights in the lead-up to the November elections.\n\nTrump conviction to dominate conversation\n\nLawmakers are sure to face questions about Trump's 34 guilty verdicts when they arrive at the Capitol on Monday, which marks the first day many will come face-to-face with reporters since a 12-person jury voted to convict the former president for falsifying business records in the case, which was centered on a $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe members most sought out will likely be a group of vulnerable House Republicans who have yet to comment on Trump's conviction. The GOP lawmakers hail from districts President Biden won in 2020, a dynamic that makes their reaction to the guilty verdict more complicated as they vie for reelection in November.\n\nThat GOP list includes California Reps. Mike Garcia, Michelle Steel, David Valadao, John Duarte and Young Kim, in addition to Reps. Tom Kean Jr. (N.J.), Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.) and David Schweikert (Ariz.). They did not respond to The Hill's requests for comment last week.\n\nAs the GOP group's silence persists, the House Democrats' campaign arm is beginning to go after the front-line Republicans, upping the pressure as they leave people wondering when -- and how -- they will respond to the historic conviction.\n\n\"If these shameless, self-serving GOP representatives cared a single bit about 'law and order' in California, they'd be condemning this 34-time convicted felon instead of endorsing him to be President of the United States,\" Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Dan Gottlieb said in a statement, name-checking many of the California lawmakers who have remained silent.\n\nThe vast majority of the Republican Party, meanwhile, has continued to hammer away at the guilty charges, labeling the process that led to the conviction politically motivated and criticizing the prosecution's star witness, Michael Cohen, as untrustworthy.\n\nTop Republicans have signaled that their outrage will translate into action on Capitol Hill in the near future. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) announced last week that he will \"demand\" Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and another top prosecutor who worked on the hush money case appear for a hearing on June 13.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) on Sunday said the purpose of that event is to \"investigate what these prosecutors are doing at the state and federal level to use politics, you know, political retribution in the court system to go after political opponents, federal officials like Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"We have to fight back, and we will, with everything in our arsenal,\" he added during a \"Fox News Sunday\" interview. \"But we do that within the confines of the rule of law. We believe in our institutions.\"\n\nHouse GOP set to grill Fauci\n\nHouse Republicans are set to grill Anthony Fauci during a high-profile hearing on the COVID-19 pandemic this week, which will mark the first time since September, 2022 that the public health expert has testified publicly.\n\nThe hearing, before the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, is slated for Monday at 10 a.m.\n\nThe event comes after Fauci -- who stepped down as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at the end of 2022, after nearly 40 years in the post -- sat for two closed-door interviews with the panel in January, during which Republicans pressed him on the \"lab-leak\" theory of the COVID-19 origins and the six-foot social distancing guidelines, among other topics.\n\nThe panel released those transcripts on Friday, ahead of Monday's hearing.\n\nRep. Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio), the chairman of the panel, said he is interested in asking Fauci about his role in the response to the pandemic and the origins of COVID-19. Republicans are also expected to ask Fauci about allegations that a NIAID official evaded public records laws to conceal records related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"Retirement from public service does not excuse Dr. Fauci from accountability to the American people,\" Wenstrup said in a statement last week.\n\nHouse to vote on ICC sanctions legislation, appropriations bill\n\nThe House this week is slated to vote on a bill to sanction the ICC after its chief prosecutor filed arrest warrants for Netanyahu and other Israeli and Hamas leaders last month, a move that sparked widespread bipartisan outrage in Washington.\n\nThe measure -- led by Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) -- calls for imposing sanctions on ICC officials who \"engaged in any effort to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute any protected person of the United States and its allies.\"\n\nThe sanctions would include blocking U.S. property transactions for individuals, deeming them inadmissible to the U.S. and revoking any visas they have.\n\n\"If the ICC insists on targeting Israel, a democracy defending itself against evil, the U.S. must stand against them and ensure there are consequences for these international bureaucrats,\" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) wrote in a floor lookout Sunday night.\n\nThe vote is sure to fracture the Democratic Caucus, which has been split on the ICC's move. Pro-Israel Democrats have slammed it, accusing the officials of drawing a false equivalency between Israel and Hamas, while pro-Palestinians liberals -- who are up in arms over the mounting humanitarian deaths in the Gaza strip -- have called for the court's independence to be respected.\n\nAdding to the internal politics, the White House last week said it was opposed to sanctioning the ICC, complicating bipartisan negotiations that had been ongoing for days.\n\nICC prosecutor Karim Khan filed the arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and the leaders of Hamas last month, arguing that they \"bear criminal responsibility\" for a handful of war crimes, such as starvation of civilians as a method of warfare and extermination as a crime against humanity.\n\nICC judges will not determine whether or not to grant the warrants.\n\nThe House this week is also set to vote on the first appropriations bill for fiscal year 2025, kicking off floor consideration of government funding measures ahead of the Sept. 30 shutdown deadline.\n\nThe legislation -- one of 12 appropriations bills -- funds military construction and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The House Appropriations Committee advanced the measure in a 34-25 vote last month.\n\nSenate to vote on bill protecting right to contraception\n\nThe Senate this week will vote on a bill to protect access to contraception as Democrats look to lean in on the issue of reproductive rights ahead of the November elections.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced in a \"Dear Colleague\" letter on Sunday that the upper chamber would vote on the legislation -- titled the Right to Contraception Act -- on Wednesday.\n\nThe vote comes ahead of the two-year anniversary of the Supreme Court decision that struck down Roe v. Wade -- the case that established a constitutional right to abortion -- sending the question of abortion rights to the states.\n\nThe contraception legislation is unlikely to clear the Senate, where the 60-vote filibuster exists. But the vote will give Democrats an opportunity to put Republicans on the record on reproductive rights, and help fuel pro-choice messaging on the campaign trail ahead of November.\n\n\"Democrats have been clear we will not stand for these attacks and we will fight to preserve reproductive freedoms,\" Schumer said in his Sunday letter.\n\n\"The hard-right MAGA Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade opened the floodgates for Republicans to force their anti-reproductive freedom, anti-women agenda down the throats of all Americans,\" he added.\n\nConsideration of the contraception bill comes after Schumer teed up a messaging vote last month on the bipartisan border deal, which a group of senators unveiled earlier this year. Republicans ultimately blocked the measure, which meant to give vulnerable Senate Democrats an opportunity to cast a vote on the record in favor of cracking down on the situation at the southern border, a matter emerging as a key campaign issue this cycle.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mychael_schnell@thehill.com", "name": "Mychael Schnell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

The hearing -- focused on the U.S.'s COVID-19 response -- could get fiery, as Republicans vow to grill the public health expert who has become a boogeyman on the right.\n\nOn the House floor, lawmakers will consider legislation to sanction International Criminal Court officials after the ICC requested arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli and Hamas leaders. The lower chamber will also vote on the first of 12 appropriations bills for fiscal year 2025.\n\nOn the other side of the Capitol, senators will vote on a bill to protect access to contraceptives, as Democrats seek to highlight reproductive rights in the lead-up to the November elections.\n\nTrump conviction to dominate conversation\n\nLawmakers are sure to face questions about Trump's 34 guilty verdicts when they arrive at the Capitol on Monday, which marks the first day many will come face-to-face with reporters since a 12-person jury voted to convict the former president for falsifying business records in the case, which was centered on a $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe members most sought out will likely be a group of vulnerable House Republicans who have yet to comment on Trump's conviction. The GOP lawmakers hail from districts President Biden won in 2020, a dynamic that makes their reaction to the guilty verdict more complicated as they vie for reelection in November.\n\nThat GOP list includes California Reps. Mike Garcia, Michelle Steel, David Valadao, John Duarte and Young Kim, in addition to Reps. Tom Kean Jr. (N.J.), Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.) and David Schweikert (Ariz.). They did not respond to The Hill's requests for comment last week.\n\nAs the GOP group's silence persists, the House Democrats' campaign arm is beginning to go after the front-line Republicans, upping the pressure as they leave people wondering when -- and how -- they will respond to the historic conviction.\n\n\"If these shameless, self-serving GOP representatives cared a single bit about 'law and order' in California, they'd be condemning this 34-time convicted felon instead of endorsing him to be President of the United States,\" Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Dan Gottlieb said in a statement, name-checking many of the California lawmakers who have remained silent.\n\nThe vast majority of the Republican Party, meanwhile, has continued to hammer away at the guilty charges, labeling the process that led to the conviction politically motivated and criticizing the prosecution's star witness, Michael Cohen, as untrustworthy.\n\nTop Republicans have signaled that their outrage will translate into action on Capitol Hill in the near future. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) announced last week that he will \"demand\" Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and another top prosecutor who worked on the hush money case appear for a hearing on June 13.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) on Sunday said the purpose of that event is to \"investigate what these prosecutors are doing at the state and federal level to use politics, you know, political retribution in the court system to go after political opponents, federal officials like Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"We have to fight back, and we will, with everything in our arsenal,\" he added during a \"Fox News Sunday\" interview. \"But we do that within the confines of the rule of law. We believe in our institutions.\"\n\nHouse GOP set to grill Fauci\n\nHouse Republicans are set to grill Anthony Fauci during a high-profile hearing on the COVID-19 pandemic this week, which will mark the first time since September, 2022 that the public health expert has testified publicly.\n\nThe hearing, before the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, is slated for Monday at 10 a.m.\n\nThe event comes after Fauci -- who stepped down as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at the end of 2022, after nearly 40 years in the post -- sat for two closed-door interviews with the panel in January, during which Republicans pressed him on the \"lab-leak\" theory of the COVID-19 origins and the six-foot social distancing guidelines, among other topics.\n\nThe panel released those transcripts on Friday, ahead of Monday's hearing.\n\nRep. Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio), the chairman of the panel, said he is interested in asking Fauci about his role in the response to the pandemic and the origins of COVID-19. Republicans are also expected to ask Fauci about allegations that a NIAID official evaded public records laws to conceal records related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"Retirement from public service does not excuse Dr. Fauci from accountability to the American people,\" Wenstrup said in a statement last week.\n\nHouse to vote on ICC sanctions legislation, appropriations bill\n\nThe House this week is slated to vote on a bill to sanction the ICC after its chief prosecutor filed arrest warrants for Netanyahu and other Israeli and Hamas leaders last month, a move that sparked widespread bipartisan outrage in Washington.\n\nThe measure -- led by Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) -- calls for imposing sanctions on ICC officials who \"engaged in any effort to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute any protected person of the United States and its allies.\"\n\nThe sanctions would include blocking U.S. property transactions for individuals, deeming them inadmissible to the U.S. and revoking any visas they have.\n\n\"If the ICC insists on targeting Israel, a democracy defending itself against evil, the U.S. must stand against them and ensure there are consequences for these international bureaucrats,\" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) wrote in a floor lookout Sunday night.\n\nThe vote is sure to fracture the Democratic Caucus, which has been split on the ICC's move. Pro-Israel Democrats have slammed it, accusing the officials of drawing a false equivalency between Israel and Hamas, while pro-Palestinians liberals -- who are up in arms over the mounting humanitarian deaths in the Gaza strip -- have called for the court's independence to be respected.\n\nAdding to the internal politics, the White House last week said it was opposed to sanctioning the ICC, complicating bipartisan negotiations that had been ongoing for days.\n\nICC prosecutor Karim Khan filed the arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and the leaders of Hamas last month, arguing that they \"bear criminal responsibility\" for a handful of war crimes, such as starvation of civilians as a method of warfare and extermination as a crime against humanity.\n\nICC judges will not determine whether or not to grant the warrants.\n\nThe House this week is also set to vote on the first appropriations bill for fiscal year 2025, kicking off floor consideration of government funding measures ahead of the Sept. 30 shutdown deadline.\n\nThe legislation -- one of 12 appropriations bills -- funds military construction and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The House Appropriations Committee advanced the measure in a 34-25 vote last month.\n\nSenate to vote on bill protecting right to contraception\n\nThe Senate this week will vote on a bill to protect access to contraception as Democrats look to lean in on the issue of reproductive rights ahead of the November elections.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced in a \"Dear Colleague\" letter on Sunday that the upper chamber would vote on the legislation -- titled the Right to Contraception Act -- on Wednesday.\n\nThe vote comes ahead of the two-year anniversary of the Supreme Court decision that struck down Roe v. Wade -- the case that established a constitutional right to abortion -- sending the question of abortion rights to the states.\n\nThe contraception legislation is unlikely to clear the Senate, where the 60-vote filibuster exists. But the vote will give Democrats an opportunity to put Republicans on the record on reproductive rights, and help fuel pro-choice messaging on the campaign trail ahead of November.\n\n\"Democrats have been clear we will not stand for these attacks and we will fight to preserve reproductive freedoms,\" Schumer said in his Sunday letter.\n\n\"The hard-right MAGA Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade opened the floodgates for Republicans to force their anti-reproductive freedom, anti-women agenda down the throats of all Americans,\" he added.\n\nConsideration of the contraception bill comes after Schumer teed up a messaging vote last month on the bipartisan border deal, which a group of senators unveiled earlier this year. Republicans ultimately blocked the measure, which meant to give vulnerable Senate Democrats an opportunity to cast a vote on the record in favor of cracking down on the situation at the southern border, a matter emerging as a key campaign issue this cycle.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

His nine projects have raked in more than $10 million in four years.\n\nNIH could respond that its employees are simply bad at spelling. A social media user pointed Just the News to 11 grants worth tens of millions of dollars in NIH's funding database that identify the recipient as \"Janessen,\" referring to vaccine maker Jannsen, responsible for the since-discontinued Johnson & Johnson COVID vaccine.\n\nSen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, joined the fray Wednesday in separate letters to NIH, Defense Department, National Science Foundation and U.S. Agency for International Development. (Ebright's Rutgers colleague Bryce Nickels, cofounder of Biosafety Now, posted them.)\n\nErnst demanded each \"confirm you have suspended all funding\" to EcoHealth, list all projects in which the nonprofit is \"involved and receiving taxpayer dollars,\" and explain whether they have access to \"all\" EcoHealth data related to funding, including bat coronavirus sequences.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services debarred both EcoHealth and Daszak this month, and NIH Principal Deputy Director Lawrence Tabak told the House subcommittee the funding ban applies across the government, Ernst reminded the agencies.\n\nTabak's hearing is best known for his admission that NIH funded gain-of-function research at WIV but only under NIH's public definition before Oct. 21, 2021 - not the higher regulatory definition NIH uses to evaluate research proposals.\n\nIn a separate letter to Archivist Colleen Shogan Wednesday, Wenstrup asked for a staff briefing about the National Archives and Records Administration's ongoing investigation of Morens' use of personal email and \"potential wrongful disposition of official records.\"\n\nBecause the subcommittee found that Morens uses the end-to-end encrypted Proton email service in addition to Gmail and had asked Daszak \"to help collect records potentially responsive to the ongoing NIH and NARA investigations,\" Wenstrup is concerned that NIH's investigation missed \"many government records,\" he told Shogan.\n\nNIAID's \"foia lady\" showed Morens \"how to make emails disappear after I am FOIA'd but before the search starts,\" according to an email from Morens to Daszak, read aloud by House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., at Tabak's hearing.\n\nMorens confirmed to Comer at that hearing that the \"foia lady\" who helped him was since-retired Margaret Moore, The Washington Examiner reported. Wenstrup told Fox News he was likely to bring in Moore, who also goes by \"Marge,\" for a transcribed interview.\n\nNIH removed Moore's directory listing, but public health watchdog U.S. Right to Know preserved an archived version.\n\nContempt for USRTK, a frequent FOIA filer on COVID origins, shows up in the emails that Wenstrup showed Bertagnolli, the NIH director.\n\n\"Do you know these guys?\" Morens asked Daszak on Jan. 21, 2022, after receiving a FOIA request from USRTK for five years of his correspondence with \"anyone\" at EcoHealth. He characterized the nonprofit's website as \"alarmist.\"\n\nDaszak called USRTK \"awful\" and \"just out to cause trouble and drum up lab leak controversy, and said he hoped NIH \"can help reduce the amount that comes out. He was especially concerned about their \"embarrassing\" emails \"criticizing the lab lakers,\" which \"will be reported as showing that we were 'conspiring' in some way.\"\n\nUSRTK posted a FOIA production that shows Morens thanking Baylor College of Medicine professor Peter Hotez, with Daszak copied on the June 29, 2021, email, for \"b***h-slapping\" a redacted person on Twitter. Hotez asked Morens to let a redacted name \"know I'm defending him on Twitter today.\"\n\nThe target of Hotez's b***h-slapping appears to be House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who had tweeted the same day that Fauci \"wasn't square with us\" about initial scientific skepticism that SARS-CoV-2 had a natural origin. Hotez quote-tweeted Jordan: \"The awful attacks on scientists from the extremists continue.\"", "source": {"uri": "theminnesotasun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Minnesota Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

If you're not watching RedState's own Jennifer Van Laar's live coverage of this, you should be.\n\nOne thing that has been the topic of work by myself and others here at RedState sprang out of this coverage, and that is the deliberate attempts to conceal emails and government information from Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests by members of Dr. Fauci's inner circle.\n\nHere are a few key statements from Representative James Comer's (R-KY) questioning of Dr. Fauci.\n\nCOMER: There's a troubling pattern of behavior here from your inner circle, not just Dr. Morens but also your Chief of Staff Mr. Folkers. Do you agree that it violates NIAID policy to use personal email for official purposes?\n\nFAUCI: The Dr. Morens issues that was discussed by this Committee violates NIH policy, yes.\n\nCOMER: But does using official email, using personal email for official business, does that violate policy?\n\nFAUCI: Using a personal email for official business violates NIH policy.\n\nCOMER: Does it violate (garbled) NIAAD policy to delete records to intentionally evade FOIA?\n\nFAUCI: Yes.\n\nThere's more, but you get the idea.\n\nThis has been an ongoing discussion, but the question is, where will it all lead?\n\nPreviously on RedState: Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic Releases Memos Implicating Fauci Advisor, Others\n\nCOVER-UP: Anthony Fauci's COVID Team Conspired to Evade FOIA Requests\n\nAs I wrote on last Wednesday:\n\n...in summary, there appears to have been an ongoing, coordinated effort to conceal information from our elected representatives and, in so doing, from the American taxpayers. Not only is this a conspiracy to evade providing information, but it is quite possibly a conspiracy to evade being held to account for misleading the American public in the course of a pandemic that not only took American lives but also - in the course of the hastily-implemented and draconian restrictions and lockdowns - ruined the livelihoods of many Americans, put the U.S. economy into a tailspin, and added billions to the national debt while causing an inflationary cycle that is still ongoing.\n\nSo, Dr. Fauci has been dragged in front of the Subcommittee to testify. What happens next? Here's my prediction:\n\nIn the end, nobody involved with this will receive anything more than a ceremonial response. Oh, there will be more sternly worded letters, and a few bureaucrats may be moved to new positions with less responsibility and exposure but will likely retain their jobs and their pensions. Dr. Fauci will retain all of the wealth he has managed to mysteriously accumulate through a career in government service.\n\nNothing else will happen. This is, in effect, a show trial without the punishment.\n\nThis is why, according to polls, Americans view Congress about as favorably as they would a skunk under the porch. It's also why an out-of-control bureaucracy, one that has long ago far exceeded the constitutional boundaries under which the government is supposed to operate, is so dangerous to our liberty.\n\nAnd this is why, when the next pandemic crisis emerges, they will try all this again.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ward_clark@redstate.com", "name": "Ward Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) is at the head of the pack, as she works to discredit Fauci and only really succeeds in displaying the incredible selfishness and shortsightedness that helped get Greene elected in the first place.\n\nNot that anyone could ever forget the man after years of COVID and even more time spent trying to drag him down, but for those just waking up from a lengthy coma, Anthony Fauci served as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for nearly 40 years, before stepping down in 2022 just two years shy of the four decade mark. He was the leading force when COVID ground the world to a halt, and he worked tirelessly to keep everyone as safe and healthy as possible in the midst of a global pandemic.\n\nHe also became an instant target of anti-vaxxers and COVID deniers, of whom MTG gleefully proclaims herself queen. She's been at the head of the pack for years now, rabidly attacking Fauci for \"forcing\" things like masks and social distancing on us, even though Greene herself was among the science-intolerant masses who blatantly refused to follow COVID protocols.\n\nAs a result of those refusals, and of public figures like Greene continuing to tout provenly false COVID narratives, millions of people were lost to the virus. In the United States alone, more than a million people died between the start of COVID's spread and present day, and we continue to see victims of the virus fill hospital beds even four years out from the first reported case.\n\nAnd, despite the definitive proof that his policies helped save lives through the pandemic, Fauci is still taking flak for his attempts to keep COVID deaths at a minimum. As he heads back for another grueling round of questioning from purely politically motivated Representatives, Greene is making sure that her voice echoes above the rest.\n\nThe glassy-eyed twit took to X to rehash the same empty arguments we've been hearing for years, but her attempt at establishing a new slogan for the anti-vax movement fell flat. (Stop trying to make fetch happen, Marj.)\n\nMost of the people died expressly because they ignored the policies Fauci put in place, but good luck getting that through Greene's brick thick skull. Conspiracy Queen that she is, Greene went onto claim that COVID was \"created in a lab,\" [Unproven] that \"vaccine injuries\" are rampant, [False] and that masking was \"useless,\" [Demonstrably false].\n\nIts a classic unhinged rant from Trump's best student, and it got just the reaction you'd expect. Not support, despite Greene's clear attempts to appeal to the anti-vax masses, but overwhelming pushback, as people pointed out just how many falsehoods fight for dominance in Greene's prepubescent tantrum of a tweet.\n\nIts also working to underline just how little impact Greene has had in her three years in office. She's among the most incompetent and inconsequential members of Congress, with a record that largely includes touting conspiracy theories just like the COVID lies. Those \"Jewish space lasers\" aren't real, and neither is Greene's narrative on Fauci, but she'll keep up the lies until the cows come home -- or until we remove her from Congress for good.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nahila_bonfiglio@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Nahila Bonfiglio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Rich McCormick, R-Ga., who sits on the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, told Newsmax on Monday that he would \"love to see\" Dr. Anthony Fauci \"put in jail\" for the damage he did to \"our entire society\" during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFauci, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, served as chief medical adviser to the president in 2021 and 2022 and was a key promoter of social distancing and COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nIn his first public appearance since stepping down as chief medical adviser, Fauci testified at a Monday hearing of the House COVID-19 panel.\n\n\"This is a guy who literally could be held in contempt because he's lied to us. This is a guy who's actually, in my opinion, cost people lives, and absolute consequences to their health, set our children back in school, helped us divide ourselves and mistrust government from here on out,\" McCormick, who is also a medical doctor, said \"Wake Up America.\"\n\n\"He's done tremendous damage to our entire society and I would love to see the book thrown at him. I'd love to see him put in jail, I'd love to see him financially suffer, but I really depend on the Department of Justice for this, and that makes me have great doubt.\"\n\nMcCormick said the panel has retained lawyers who have read \"literally 45,000 pages of emails,\" in preparation for Monday's hearing.\n\n\"I'm glad I'm not a lawyer. I hope we do hold him accountable,\" he said. \"I hope we do hold him in contempt. I hope he is going to actually have some consequences in the future.\"\n\nMcCormick also said that Fauci admitting that the masks for children and social distancing were not based on science \"is exactly what I'm worried about.\"\n\n\"This is what I hope, if nothing else, that we get out of these hearings,\" McCormick said. \"The government will use any sort of emergency, any sort of dilemma, to grab more power, to actually take away something from us, the people.\n\n\"When the government gets to determine what's moral, what's right, what your medical conditions are treated with, whether you can travel, whether your business can be open or closed, or who you hire or fire, that is not American and that's what this fight is really about. And that's what we're trying to expose so it never happens again.\"\n\nAbout NEWSMAX TV:\n\nNEWSMAX is the fastest-growing cable news channel in America!\n\nFind Newsmax channel in your home via cable and satellite systems - More Info Here Watch Newsmax+ on your home TV app or smartphone and watch it anywhere!

Andrew Harnik/Getty Images/Andrew Harnik/Getty Images hide caption\n\nAt the start of a hearing on COVID's origins last month, Ohio Republican Brad Wenstrup said that the committee was not out to attack science.\n\n\"Let me be clear, I support global health research; I support work that will make the world safer,\" Wenstrup said. \"Our concern is that this research, and research similar, does the opposite -- it puts the world at the risk of a pandemic.\"\n\nIn the three-hour exchange that followed, Wenstrup and his Republican colleagues excoriated Dr. Peter Daszak, a scientist at the center of the debate around COVID's origins. Daszak is the president of EcoHealth Alliance, a group that, prior to the onset of the pandemic, conducted research on bat coronaviruses. Some of that work was done in conjunction with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a Chinese-government laboratory that many Republicans believe may have started the pandemic.\n\nDaszak was taken to task by both Republicans and Democrats for failing to comply with the terms of grants issued to EcoHealth. As a result of the ongoing hearings, EcoHealth Alliance recently had its access to federal grant funding suspended -- with an eye toward debarring them from receiving future funding. Both Daszak and EcoHealth say they will appeal the decision.\n\nOn Monday, the committee will hear testimony from Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who became the public face of science during the pandemic. Committee members are expected to grill Fauci on EcoHealth and other aspects of pandemic decision-making. They will also ask about e-mail exchanges between Daszak and one of Fauci's senior advisors, Dr. David Morens. A subpoena by the committee recently turned up embarrassing exchanges between Morens and Daszak, in which they appeared to be trying to avoid public records laws.\n\nSome in the scientific community see the hearings as the latest in an ongoing harassment campaign to discredit scientists who did their best to support the country during the worst pandemic in over a century.\n\n\"This select subcommittee could have tried to use its powers to try and understand the scientific evidence,\" say Michael Worobey, the head of the department of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona. Instead, he says the subcommittee has chosen to interrogate scientists about grants and e-mails.\n\n\"It is a disservice to the American people to have a hearing on this topic but to not hear what the scientists who understand it best have to say,\" Worobey says.\n\nThe hearings are \"absolutely atrocious,\" says Dr. Peter Hotez, the dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas. \"Parading prominent virologists in front of C-SPAN cameras to humiliate them is going to have long-term detrimental effects on science, biopreparedness and virology.\"\n\nBut others, particularly those who believe that lax laboratory safety practices in China may have sparked the pandemic, say the hearings and the punishment of EcoHealth are appropriate.\n\nAlina Chan, a molecular biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard who has called for the laboratory origins of COVID to be probed more closely, welcomed the scrutiny.\n\n\"EcoHealth Alliance should not receive any further federal funding until it turns over all exchanges with the Wuhan Institute of Virology and demonstrates that it can responsibly track research experiments paid for with taxpayer dollars,\" she said over email.\n\nJamie Metzl, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who studies biotechnology and has investigated possible laboratory origins of the virus, agrees.\n\n\"Both Peter Daszak and EcoHealth have not lived up to the standards of U.S. government grantees,\" he says.\n\nDaszak and EcoHealth have been at the center of the debates of COVID's origins since the very beginning of the pandemic. As an expert in both bat coronaviruses and the work done at the Wuhan laboratory, he was often quoted by media in the pandemic's early days. He also helped organize a letter in the Lancet that labeled the idea of a laboratory origin for the COVID virus as a \"conspiracy theory.\"\n\nBut Daszak's connections to the Wuhan Institute of Virology brought scrutiny, particularly from the political right. Although he says his work never involved \"gain-of-function\" research to make coronaviruses more contagious in humans, journalists uncovered a proposal for a grant to conduct gain-of-function work in 2018. The grant was denied, but many pointed to the application as evidence of a cover-up.\n\nIn its hearing with Daszak in early May, the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic revealed new evidence that EcoHealth had not properly maintained an existing grant with NIH to fund work at the Wuhan Institute. Among other infractions, the committee showed evidence that EcoHealth had failed to properly upload an update on the grant to NIH servers, and that it had failed to obtain lab reports from Wuhan about the work being done there with NIH money.\n\nIn response, the Department of Health and Human Services suspended funding to EcoHealth and has proposed barring the organization and Daszak from federal grants. Debarment generally lasts three years or less, but can be extended depending on the circumstances.\n\nDaszak says that both he and EcoHealth will fight the suspension. \"The people who are promoting the idea that there's some sort of coverup and backroom deals have done a great job of presenting every little snippet they can,\" Daszak said in an interview with NPR. But, he says, the allegations against his group are without merit:\n\n\"Is there something illegal or unethical that EcoHealth Alliance has done? No way,\" he says.\n\nIn addition to the scrutiny it has brought to EcoHealth's funding, the committee has also probed communications between EcoHealth's Daszak and Morens, a senior advisor to Fauci.\n\nThrough a subpoena, the committee obtained emails from Morens that appear to show the two joking about taking a cut from EcoHealth grants and evading public records requests. At one point, Morens wrote: \"I learned from our FOIA lady here how to make emails disappear after I'm FOIA'd.\"\n\nIn a hearing on May 22, Morens said that the emails were part of a misunderstanding because his personal email and NIH email were on the same phone.\n\n\"I was thinking I was communicating in private...Not as a government employee but as a private citizen,\" he told committee members.\n\nDaszak says that Morens never directly supervised EcoHealth grants, and that the pair wasn't conducting official communications via Gmail.\n\n\"David Morens was not and is not involved in the management of any of EcoHealth Alliance's NIH grants or awards,\" he says. \"He's been accused of doing NIH business with us via Gmail, and that's simply untrue.\"\n\nBoth Daszak and Morens maintain that the correspondence came during a dark time for Daszak, who found himself at the center of numerous conspiracy theories.\n\n\"We were being attacked; we had people breaking into our offices, we had threats -- my children's names had been put up on a 4Chan kill list,\" Daszak says.\n\nIn the hearing, Morens says much of the correspondence was meant to help lift the mood of Daszak, who he counts as a personal friend.\n\n\"I was trying to help a friend by cheering him up with black humor and things like that,\" he says.\n\nMonday's hearing with Fauci will likely see the former NIAID director grilled about the emails between Morens and Daszak and about EcoHealth's suspended grant. Some Republicans may also probe whether Fauci himself profited in any way from the pandemic.\n\nThat questioning feeds into a conspiracy theory that EcoHealth was somehow doing Fauci's bidding to seed the pandemic. It's an unfounded claim that Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene openly hinted at during the May 22 hearing: \"I personally believe that Peter Daszak at EcoHealth had a lot to do with the fact that COVID was raging,\" Greene said. Greene has previously promoted conspiracy theories around COVID vaccines, called the coronavirus a \"manufactured plague\" and called for the firing of Anthony Fauci.\n\nMetzl says that he doesn't believe such far-out theories about COVID's origins. But he nevertheless feels that the hearings are appropriate and have turned up evidence that deserves public attention.\n\n\"Tony Fauci [is] not directly responsible for COVID-19,\" he says. \"We should still be asking very tough questions. We should still be investigating everything.\"\n\nBut Worobey says the hearings are creating a political football out of a vital scientific question -- understanding where COVID came from and how it spread. He says the evidence is \"overwhelming\" that COVID began in nature and then was transmitted to humans at a handful of live animal markets in Wuhan.\n\nNow another animal-borne virus, the H5N1 bird flu, is spreading through the U.S., Worobey says -- but \"no one's talking about what should we be doing to prevent these ticking time bombs?\"\n\nHotez says he fears that the hearings are doing little more than damaging the reputation of scientists to score political points. The committee \"said on their official Twitter website, 'get your popcorn ready,'\" he says. \"They are not even pretending this is anything other than political theater or Fox News soundbites.\"", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "geoff_brumfiel@npr.org", "name": "Geoff Brumfiel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_ecology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health ecology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan_Institute_of_Virology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan Institute of Virology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

(FOIA stands for Freedom of Information Act, and anyone can file these requests with federal offices and agencies to gather information that would have previously been out of public view.) Here's what Piper wrote:\n\nGOP staff released a report that showed Morens - now on administrative leave - bragging to Daszak that 'there is no worry about FOIAs' because Fauci is 'too smart to let colleagues send him stuff that could cause trouble' and Morens can 'send stuff to Tony on his private gmail, or hand it to him at work or at his house.'\n\nEmails released by the subcommittee this week show Folkers internally referred to EcoHealth, which passed through NIAID grants to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, as 'Ec~Health,' and virologist Kristian Andersen, who said Fauci 'prompted' him and other scientists to write the narrative-setting 'Proximal Origin' paper against the lab-leak theory, as 'Anders$n.'\n\n...\n\nThe new emails suggest NIAID employees 'strategically use language to avoid key word searches' by intentionally misspelling expected search terms, and that Folkers specifically did this 'routinely,'....\n\nFor context, \"Daszak\" is Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, and \"Folkers\" is Greg Folkers, Fauci's former chief of staff.\n\nHuh, almost like they had something to hide, right? Piper anticipated an NIH defense:\n\nNIH could respond that its employees are simply bad at spelling. A social media user pointed Just the News to 11 grants worth tens of millions of dollars in NIH's funding database that identify the recipient as 'Janessen,' referring to vaccine maker Jannsen, responsible for the since-discontinued Johnson & Johnson COVID vaccine.\n\nThe difference though should be obvious -- one of these can actually pass off as a legitimate typo by government bureaucrats, the other is using symbols in place of letters. No one would ever genuinely believe that top scientists at the NIAID actually thought somebody had a dollar sign in his name, or that EcoHealth was spelled with a tilde in place of the \"o\" sound.\n\nNIAID's 'foia lady' showed Morens 'how to make emails disappear after I am FOIA'd but before the search starts,' according to an email from Morens to Daszak, read aloud by House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., at Tabak's hearing.\n\nMorens confirmed to Comer at that hearing that the 'foia lady' who helped him was since-retired Margaret Moore, The Washington Examiner reported. Wenstrup told Fox News he was likely to bring in Moore, who also goes by 'Marge,' for a transcribed interview.\n\nNIH removed Moore's directory listing, but public health watchdog U.S. Right to Know preserved an archived version.\n\nDon't they know that the internet never forgets?\n\nNow, if using typos to evade FOIA requests were truly standard practice at the NIAID, is it the same at other government agencies too?\n\nWhen you \"search\" for \"James Corney\" on the DOJ website, why do a bunch of documents populate regarding former FBI director James B. Comey? Documents specifically related to the propagandistic Steele Dossier? Is the agency trying to hide the most incriminating evidence behind a \"typo\" too?", "source": {"uri": "americanthinker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Thinker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Both Daszak and EcoHealth say they will appeal the decision.\n\nOn Monday, the committee will hear testimony from Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who became the public face of science during the pandemic. Committee members are expected to grill Fauci on EcoHealth and other aspects of pandemic decision-making. They will also ask about e-mail exchanges between Daszak and one of Fauci's senior advisors, Dr. David Morens. A subpoena by the committee recently turned up embarrassing exchanges between Morens and Daszak, in which they appeared to be trying to avoid public records laws.\n\nSome in the scientific community see the hearings as the latest in an ongoing harassment campaign to discredit scientists who did their best to support the country during the worst pandemic in over a century.\n\n\"This select subcommittee could have tried to use its powers to try and understand the scientific evidence,\" say Michael Worobey, the head of the department of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona. Instead, he says the subcommittee has chosen to interrogate scientists about grants and e-mails.\n\n\"It is a disservice to the American people to have a hearing on this topic but to not hear what the scientists who understand it best have to say,\" Worobey says.\n\nThe hearings are \"absolutely atrocious,\" says Dr. Peter Hotez, the dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas. \"Parading prominent virologists in front of C-SPAN cameras to humiliate them is going to have long-term detrimental effects on science, biopreparedness and virology.\"\n\nBut others, particularly those who believe that lax laboratory safety practices in China may have sparked the pandemic, say the hearings and the punishment of EcoHealth are appropriate.\n\nAlina Chan, a molecular biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard who has called for the laboratory origins of COVID to be probed more closely, welcomed the scrutiny.\n\n\"EcoHealth Alliance should not receive any further federal funding until it turns over all exchanges with the Wuhan Institute of Virology and demonstrates that it can responsibly track research experiments paid for with taxpayer dollars,\" she said over email.\n\nJamie Metzl, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who studies biotechnology and has investigated possible laboratory origins of the virus, agrees.\n\n\"Both Peter Daszak and EcoHealth have not lived up to the standards of U.S. government grantees,\" he says.\n\nDaszak and EcoHealth have been at the center of the debates of COVID's origins since the very beginning of the pandemic. As an expert in both bat coronaviruses and the work done at the Wuhan laboratory, he was often quoted by media in the pandemic's early days. He also helped organize a letter in the Lancet that labeled the idea of a laboratory origin for the COVID virus as a \"conspiracy theory.\"\n\nBut Daszak's connections to the Wuhan Institute of Virology brought scrutiny, particularly from the political right. Although he says his work never involved \"gain-of-function\" research to make coronaviruses more contagious in humans, journalists uncovered a proposal for a grant to conduct gain-of-function work in 2018. The grant was denied, but many pointed to the application as evidence of a cover-up.\n\nIn its hearing with Daszak in early May, the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic revealed new evidence that EcoHealth had not properly maintained an existing grant with NIH to fund work at the Wuhan Institute. Among other infractions, the committee showed evidence that EcoHealth had failed to properly upload an update on the grant to NIH servers, and that it had failed to obtain lab reports from Wuhan about the work being done there with NIH money.\n\nIn response, the Department of Health and Human Services suspended funding to EcoHealth and has proposed barring the organization and Daszak from federal grants. Debarment generally lasts three years or less, but can be extended depending on the circumstances.\n\nDaszak says that both he and EcoHealth will fight the suspension. \"The people who are promoting the idea that there's some sort of coverup and backroom deals have done a great job of presenting every little snippet they can,\" Daszak said in an interview with NPR. But, he says, the allegations against his group are without merit:\n\n\"Is there something illegal or unethical that EcoHealth Alliance has done? No way,\" he says.\n\nIn addition to the scrutiny it has brought to EcoHealth's funding, the committee has also probed communications between EcoHealth's Daszak and Morens, a senior advisor to Fauci.\n\nThrough a subpoena, the committee obtained emails from Morens that appear to show the two joking about taking a cut from EcoHealth grants and evading public records requests. At one point, Morens wrote: \"I learned from our FOIA lady here how to make emails disappear after I'm FOIA'd.\"\n\nIn a hearing on May 22, Morens said that the emails were part of a misunderstanding because his personal email and NIH email were on the same phone.\n\n\"I was thinking I was communicating in private...Not as a government employee but as a private citizen,\" he told committee members.\n\nDaszak says that Morens never directly supervised EcoHealth grants, and that the pair wasn't conducting official communications via Gmail.\n\n\"David Morens was not and is not involved in the management of any of EcoHealth Alliance's NIH grants or awards,\" he says. \"He's been accused of doing NIH business with us via Gmail, and that's simply untrue.\"\n\nBoth Daszak and Morens maintain that the correspondence came during a dark time for Daszak, who found himself at the center of numerous conspiracy theories.\n\n\"We were being attacked; we had people breaking into our offices, we had threats -- my children's names had been put up on a 4Chan kill list,\" Daszak says.\n\nIn the hearing, Morens says much of the correspondence was meant to help lift the mood of Daszak, who he counts as a personal friend.\n\n\"I was trying to help a friend by cheering him up with black humor and things like that,\" he says.\n\nMonday's hearing with Fauci will likely see the former NIAID director grilled about the emails between Morens and Daszak and about EcoHealth's suspended grant. Some Republicans may also probe whether Fauci himself profited in any way from the pandemic.\n\nThat questioning feeds into a conspiracy theory that EcoHealth was somehow doing Fauci's bidding to seed the pandemic. It's an unfounded claim that Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene openly hinted at during the May 22 hearing: \"I personally believe that Peter Daszak at EcoHealth had a lot to do with the fact that COVID was raging,\" Greene said. Greene has previously promoted conspiracy theories around COVID vaccines, called the coronavirus a \"manufactured plague\" and called for the firing of Anthony Fauci.\n\nMetzl says that he doesn't believe such far-out theories about COVID's origins. But he nevertheless feels that the hearings are appropriate and have turned up evidence that deserves public attention.\n\n\"Tony Fauci [is] not directly responsible for COVID-19,\" he says. \"We should still be asking very tough questions. We should still be investigating everything.\"\n\nBut Worobey says the hearings are creating a political football out of a vital scientific question -- understanding where COVID came from and how it spread. He says the evidence is \"overwhelming\" that COVID began in nature and then was transmitted to humans at a handful of live animal markets in Wuhan.\n\nNow another animal-borne virus, the H5N1 bird flu, is spreading through the U.S., Worobey says -- but \"no one's talking about what should we be doing to prevent these ticking time bombs?\"\n\nHotez says he fears that the hearings are doing little more than damaging the reputation of scientists to score political points. The committee \"said on their official Twitter website, 'get your popcorn ready,'\" he says. \"They are not even pretending this is anything other than political theater or Fox News soundbites.\"", "source": {"uri": "kgou.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KGOU 106.3"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_ecology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health ecology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan_Institute_of_Virology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wuhan Institute of Virology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Instead, park rangers transported the man to a higher elevation in an ambulance, and then was flown to University Medical Center in Las Vegas, officials said.\n\nThird-degree burns destroys two layers of skin and may damage bones, muscles and tendons, according to Stanford Medicine. The burned area appears white or charred, and it has no sensation because nerve endings are destroyed.\n\nThe incident came just two weeks after a motorcyclist died in Death Valley from heat exposure, the Death Valley National Park said in a news release. The high temperature that day was 128 degrees, according to preliminary data. Death Valley hit 129 degrees the next day, which hadn't happened in July since 2021.\n\nLast July, a 71-year-old man collapsed and died outside a restroom in Death Valley National Park after park rangers believe he hiked a nearby trail. Another man was found dead in his disabled vehicle on the side of the road in the park, with park rangers suspecting he succumbed to heat illness while driving and then baked in temperatures as high as 126 degrees.\n\nSo far this month, Death Valley has seen 20 days with temperatures over 120 degrees, including every day from July 15 through at least Tuesday. The average temperature for Death Valley in July is 117 degrees.\n\nThe park also had nine consecutive days above 125 degrees this month, which is its second-longest streak above 125 on record.\n\nDespite extreme summer heat - or even because of it - Death Valley National Park is a popular tourist attraction. The park, regarded as one of the hottest places on Earth, drew about 1.1 million visitors in 2023, according to the National Park Service.\n\n\"Many visitors come here in the summer specifically to experience the extreme heat,\" the service said.\n\nThe park responded to 88 emergency medical calls and 23 search-and-rescue requests last year.

Instead, park rangers transported the man to a higher elevation in an ambulance, and then was flown to University Medical Center in Las Vegas, officials said.\n\nThird-degree burns destroys two layers of skin and may damage bones, muscles and tendons, according to Stanford Medicine. The burned area appears white or charred, and it has no sensation because nerve endings are destroyed.\n\nThe incident came just two weeks after a motorcyclist died in Death Valley from heat exposure, the Death Valley National Park said in a news release. The high temperature that day was 128 degrees, according to preliminary data. Death Valley hit 129 degrees the next day, which hadn't happened in July since 2021.\n\nLast July, a 71-year-old man collapsed and died outside a restroom in Death Valley National Park after park rangers believe he hiked a nearby trail. Another man was found dead in his disabled vehicle on the side of the road in the park, with park rangers suspecting he succumbed to heat illness while driving and then baked in temperatures as high as 126 degrees.\n\nSo far this month, Death Valley has seen 20 days with temperatures over 120 degrees, including every day from July 15 through at least Tuesday. The average temperature for Death Valley in July is 117 degrees.\n\nThe park also had nine consecutive days above 125 degrees this month, which is its second-longest streak above 125 on record.\n\nDespite extreme summer heat - or even because of it - Death Valley National Park is a popular tourist attraction. The park, regarded as one of the hottest places on Earth, drew about 1.1 million visitors in 2023, according to the National Park Service.\n\n\"Many visitors come here in the summer specifically to experience the extreme heat,\" the service said.\n\nThe park responded to 88 emergency medical calls and 23 search-and-rescue requests last year. An alert from the National Park Service tells visitors to expect high temperatures of 100 to 130 degrees.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

It's unknown whether his flip flops broke or were lost in the sand, leading him to be barefoot on the hot surface.\n\n\"The ground temperature would have been much hotter that air temperature, which was around 123\u00b0F,\" NPS said in the release.\n\nThe man's family called for help, and park rangers carried him to the parking lot.\n\nNever been to Death Valley? Here's everything travelers need to know\n\nDue to the severity of the burns and his pain, the park rangers determined that the man needed immediate hospital care. Third-degree burns damage layers of the skin down to the tissue, possibly the nerve endings too. The bones, muscles and tendons might also be affected.\n\nThe extreme temperatures in Death Valley made it unsafe for the medevac helicopter to land, and the man was transported in an ambulance to a landing zone at a higher elevation with a slightly cooler temperature. There, a helicopter was able to pick him up and take him to University Medical Center in Las Vegas.\n\nPark rangers have been warning visitors about Death Valley's extreme heat this summer, with temperatures ranging between 100\u00b0F and 130\u00b0F. Located primarily in California, Death Valley is the hottest, driest and lowest national park, making it notable for travelers, but also dangerous.\n\nEarlier this month, a motorcyclist died of heat exposure in the park as temperatures broke a record high of 128\u00b0F. The rider was part of a group of six other motorcyclists traversing the park, and one other had to be hospitalized for severe heat illness. Four of the riders were treated within the park and released.\n\n\"Park rangers recommend that summer travelers to Death Valley National Park stay within a 10 minute walk of an air conditioned vehicle, not hike after 10 a.m., drink plenty of water, eat salty snacks, and wear a hat and sunscreen,\" NPS said.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Valley", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Death Valley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Burn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_ranger", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Park ranger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Places_of_interest_in_the_Death_Valley_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Places of interest in the Death Valley area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Valley_National_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Death Valley National Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Park_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Park Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesquite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mesquite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunrise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tissue (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flops", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flip-flops"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muscle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tendon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tendon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_evacuation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medical evacuation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elevation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Individual_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Individual Parks", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Defunct", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Defunct", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Guides", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Skateboarding/Skate_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Skateboarding/Skate Parks", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/24/USAT/74531140007-dvn-pambulanceand-mercy-airhelicopterat-3000-lz.png?auto=webp&crop=1919,1081,x0,y179&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761159", "eventUri": "eng-9761159", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

The man's condition is unclear.\n\nIt is believed the man was initially wearing flip flops, but it is unclear whether he lost them or if they became buried under sand dunes\n\nBut just two days earlier, on July 18, the same higher-elevation helicopter site had to be used for a woman who collapsed while hiking the Badlands Loop, Mercury News reports.\n\nHer companion told park rangers they set out on the two-and-a-half mile loop at around 9.30am, when the temperature was around 110 degrees.\n\nBut a wrong turn extended their hike, and the unidentified woman was unable to keep walking.\n\nHer hiking companion then returned to the parking lot alone, but found it had no cell phone service to call for help.\n\nFinally at around 11am, another park visitor arrived at the Furnace Creek visitor center to report the emergency.\n\nPark-goers then carried the unconscious woman to the trailhead, and an ambulance brought her to the helicopter.\n\nShe was then flown to a Las Vegas hospital for treatment of heat illness, park officials said.\n\nRangers advise travelers to avoid hiking at Death Valley National Park after 10am\n\nMeanwhile, on July 6, one of six German men traveling by motorcycle died of heat illness as temperatures reached 128-degrees.\n\nAuthorities now advise visitors to stay close to air conditioned areas, remain hydrated, use sunscreen and avoid

A wrong turn extended their hike, he said, and the woman was unable to keep walking. He returned alone to the Zabriskie Point parking lot, which has no cell phone service; around 11 a.m., another park visitor arrived at the Furnace Creek visitor center to report the emergency.\n\nWhen rangers arrived, visitors had carried the unconscious woman to the trailhead. An ambulance took her to the helicopter, and she was flown to a Las Vegas hospital for treatment of what the park report called heat illness.

Because of language issues, the rangers said they were not immediately able to determine whether the 42-year-old Belgian's flip-flops were somehow broken or were lost at Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes during a short Saturday walk.\n\nThe ground temperature would have been much hotter than the air temperature that day, which was around 123 degrees Fahrenheit (50.5 Celsius). Death Valley National Park has seen record highs this summer in the desert that sits 194 feet (59 meters) below sea level near the California-Nevada line.\n\nThe man\u00b4s family called on other visitors to carry him to a parking lot. Rangers then drove him to a higher elevation where a medical helicopter would be able to safely land amid extreme temperatures, which reduce roto lift. The man was flown to University Medical Center in Las Vegas.\n\nThe medical center operates the Lions Burn Care Center. During the summer, many patients from Nevada and parts of California go to the center with contact burns such as the ones the Belgian man suffered.\n\nBlazing hot surfaces like asphalt and concrete are also a danger for catastrophic burn injuries in the urban areas of the desert Southwest. The bulk of the Las Vegas burn center's patients come from the surrounding urban area, which regularly sees summertime highs in the triple digits.\n\nFILE - Desert brush grows on the Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes on Tuesday, July 11, 2023, in Death Valley National Park, Calif.

(AP Photo/Ty ONeil)\n\nThermal injuries from hot surfaces like sidewalks, patios and playground equipment are also common in Arizona's Maricopa County, which encompasses Phoenix.\n\nAir temperatures can also be dangerous in Death Valley, where a motorcyclist died from heat-related causes earlier this month.\n\nAt the valley's salt flats in Badwater Basin, the lowest point in North America, the park has a large red stop sign that warns visitors of the dangers of extreme heat to their bodies after 10 a.m.\n\nPark rangers warn summer travelers to not hike at all in the valley after 10 a.m. and to stay within a 10-minute walk of an air-conditioned vehicle. Rangers recommend drinking plenty of water, eating salty snacks and wearing a hat and sunscreen.\n\nFILE - A stop sign warns tourists of extreme heat at Badwater Basin, Monday, July 8, 2024, in Death Valley National Park, Calif.

With temperatures soaring upwards of 120 degrees Fahrenheit and sand temperatures even hotter, keeping your skin protected is crucial.\n\nOne recent visitor to Death Valley learned the hard way why safety is essential when visiting the park. According to a statement from the National Park Service, a 42-year-old Belgian tourist was walking on the Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes on July 20 when he either broke or lost his flip-flops in the sand. The steaming sand ended up giving him third-degree burns on his feet.\n\n\"The skin was melted off his foot,\" Death Valley National Park Service ranger Gia Ponce told The Los Angeles Times. \"The ground can be much hotter -- 170 [or] 180 [degrees]. Sometimes up into the 200 range.\"\n\nAuthorities say the man was in extreme pain as his family got other visitors to help carry him to the dunes parking lot. There, park rangers looked at his injuries and determined he needed treatment. Unfortunately, because heat creates thinner air, a helicopter couldn't land to airlift him to a hospital, so they took him in an ambulance to higher ground where he was flown out.\n\nIt goes without saying that going to Death Valley's sand dunes is nothing like going to other sandy locations.\n\n\"People think it's going to be like the beach where you can get out there with flip-flops or sandals, but because of the extreme temperatures, those dunes heat up just as much as the pavement does,\" Ponce said. The park rangers themselves don't play with the heat and often wear gloves when touching anything that's been in the sun. \"We gingerly touch surfaces if we're outside, like doorknobs,\" she said.\n\nIf you plan to go to Death Valley this summer, don't do so without following NPS protocol and coming prepared with proper shoes, plenty of water, and a good amount of sunscreen.", "source": {"uri": "mensjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Men's Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_malone_mendez@mensjournal.com", "name": "Chris Malone M\u00e9ndez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Valley", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Death Valley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Valley_National_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Death Valley National Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fahrenheit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Park_Service_ranger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Park Service ranger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Places_of_interest_in_the_Death_Valley_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Places of interest in the Death Valley area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Park_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Park Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flops", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flip-flops"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_ranger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Park ranger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunscreen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunscreen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Individual_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Individual Parks", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Guides", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death_and_Funeral_Customs", "label": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death and Funeral Customs", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near_Death_Experiences", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near Death Experiences", "wgt": 22}], "image": "https://www.mensjournal.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA4MDgzMTI1MDQzOTk2MTAx/tourist-at-mesquite-sand-dunes-death-valley-usa.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761159", "eventUri": "eng-9761159", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 550, "textEnd": 557}], "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

that people's risk of getting heat-related illnesses rises with high humidity, high elevation and if a person does \"strenuous activities.\" They recommend that individuals experiencing heat-stroke

The extreme heat has already caused several deaths -- a man passing through the park on a motorcycle who got lost was eventually found dead of \"severe heat illness,\" while a father-daughter hiking team who came to Death Valley from Wisconsin was also discovered dead on the Syncline Trail. Park authorities later revealed that they had \"gotten lost and run out of water.\"\n\nRelated: A problem has been spreading throughout national parks\n\nAs announced by the National Park Service (NPS), a 42-year-old visitor from Belgium had been walking through the Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes section of Death Valley, known for wide stretches of sand, when he became separated from the flip-flops he was wearing that then got lost in the sand.\n\nPark ranger describes: 'The skin was melted off his foot'\n\nAs the sand is significantly hotter than the already-scorching air, the man suffered third-degree burns on the soles of his feet.\n\nMore On National Parks:\n\nMultiple national parks warn of similar dangerWatch Out: This national park is officially the country's deadliestOne of the biggest crimes committed in a national park is solved\n\n\"The skin was melted off his foot,\" Death Valley National Park Service Ranger Gia Ponce said in a statement to the Los Angeles Times. \"The ground can be much hotter -- 170, 180 [degrees]. Sometimes up into the 200 range.\"\n\nWhile family and nearby park visitors helped carry the man away from the sand and to a nearby parking lot until help arrived, the NPS helicopter could not get to that part of the park due to extreme heat (when the air is that heavy, the helicopter's rotor is unable to turn properly.)\n\nRelated: Get the best cruise tips, deals, and news on the ships from our expert cruiser\n\nVisiting Death Valley in the summer heat? Here is what you need to know\n\n\"Park rangers transported the man in an ambulance to a landing zone at higher elevation, which was 109\u00b0F,\" the NPS writes. \"Mercy Air transported the man to University Medical Center in Las Vegas.\"\n\nFurther information on his condition has not yet been released. With incidents of severe illness and in some cases even death at Death Valley continuing to rise throughout July, the NPS has been issuing warnings around hiking in extreme heat.\n\nWhile this most often comes down to putting off especially long or strenuous hikes until cooler weather and packing enough water (the official recommendation is one liter for every hour spent hiking), visiting the dunes section of the park also requires proper clothing and most importantly footwear with closed toes as flip-flops can easily slip off.\n\n\"People think it's going to be like the beach where you can get out there with flip-flops or sandals but because of the extreme temperatures, those dunes heat up just as much as the pavement does,\" Ponce said further.\n\nThe NPS also issued a statement imploring park visitors to \"stay within a 10-minute walk of an air conditioned vehicle, not hike after 10 a.m., drink plenty of water, eat salty snacks and wear a hat and sunscreen.\"\n\nRelated:

Due to this heat, the man eventually had to be rescued after \"suffering full-thickness burns on his feet.\"\n\nThe NPS said that once park rangers reached the 42-year-old man, they determined that he needed to be transported to a hospital quickly \"due to his burns and pain level.\" However, they had some difficulty as Mercy Air's helicopter wasn't able to land \"safely\" in the area due to the extreme heat conditions, which \"reduce rotor lift.\"\n\nThe man had to be transported by park rangers in an ambulance to a landing zone in a higher location, where the temperature was much lower at 109\u00b0F, according to the NPS. Mercy Air eventually transported the man to the University Medical Center in Las Vegas, where he was able to receive treatment.\n\nPark officials noted in their press release that they recommend Death Valley National Park visitors take several precautions when visiting the area during this time of the year. These include staying \"within a 10 minute walk of an air conditioned vehicle,\" not hiking after 10 a.m., drinking \"plenty of water\" and wearing \"a hat and sunscreen.\"\n\nThe rescue comes after the NPS issued an \"extreme summer heat\" danger alert in effect for Death Valley, noting that travelers should expect high temperatures of 100\u00b0F to 130\u00b0F.\n\nThe NPS warned that people hiking or traveling in this area should \"minimize\" their time outside in heat and \"travel prepared to survive\" as \"cell phones do not work in most of the park.\"\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up

that people should plan ahead to prevent heat-related illnesses like heat rash and heat stroke, which can be dangerous as it could \"lead to brain damage or injure vital organs.\"\n\nThe NPS noted that people's risk of getting heat-related illnesses rises with high humidity, high elevation and if a person does \"strenuous activities.\" They recommend that individuals experiencing heat-stroke

He reportedly lost his shoes while taking a short walk on Saturday at the park's Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes, according the National Parks Service.\n\nThe site provides visitors with the chance to hike routes of their choosing across the dunes. The tourist who was injured was reportedly wearing flip flops while walking on the dunes. At some point, he either lost his flip flop or the footwear broke, leaving his bare foot exposed to the blistering sand.\n\nOthers in his group had to carry him off the dunes and transported him to a ranger station for treatment.\n\nDeath Valley is known for being the hottest place on Earth, and thanks to the ongoing climate crisis temperatures in the region are only likely to increase. The southwest US has been enduring consistent triple digit temperatures this summer, and one individual died in Death Valley early this month on a day when temperatures reached 128 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth was logged in Death Valley in July 1913, when the air temperature reached 134 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the National Park Service.\n\nOn Saturday, the day the tourist was injured, air temperatures at the park reached 123 degrees, and a park official noted that the temperature of the dunes would have been hotter than the air.\n\nRangers treating the tourist transported him via ambulance to a helicopter pick-up spot, where he was flown to a nearby hospital. An initial attempt to connect with a helicopter failed due to the high heat preventing the aircraft from operating safely. Rangers were forced to take the man to higher elevation where the aircraft could land safely, according to CBS News.\n\nThe park service recommends that summer visitors to Death Valley avoid hiking in late morning and afternoon and stay within 10 minutes of a car with air conditioning to avoid heat-related injuries and illnesses. They also advised wearing a hat and sunscreen, bringing plenty of water, and eating salty snacks to assist with water retention.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health published a study last year detailing how air temperatures affect sand temperatures. According to the study, sand can reach more than 100 degrees once the air temperature hits 75 degrees. When the air temperature hits 90 degrees, sand can reach more than 120 degrees -- enough to cause a first-degree burn.\n\nHuman skin can sustain a first-degree burn at 118 degrees, and a second-degree burn at 131 degrees, according to the National Institute for Standards and Technology. A third degree burn can occur after prolonged -- several minutes or longer -- exposure to temperatures over 120 degrees.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Valley", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Death Valley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Places_of_interest_in_the_Death_Valley_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Places of interest in the Death Valley area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Valley_National_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Death Valley National Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Burn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fahrenheit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flops", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flip-flops"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Park_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Park Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_ranger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Park ranger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_illness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat illness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Institute of Standards and Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elevation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hiking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Individual_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Individual Parks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Water_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Water Parks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/09/05/California_Heat_Wave_Weather_58174.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761159", "eventUri": "eng-9761159", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4588235294117647, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

That led to the man quickly developing third-degree burns, and Ponce painted a gory mental picture of the scene in question by saying, \"The skin was melted off his foot\"\n\nA group of visitors managed to carry the victim to safety before he received first aid and was placed in an ambulance that transported him to an area where he could be airlifted to Las Vegas for further treatment.", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BroBible"}, "authors": [{"uri": "connor_toole@brobible.com", "name": "Connor Toole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Valley", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Death Valley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Valley_National_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Death Valley National Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Meteorological Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermometer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thermometer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furnace_Creek,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Furnace Creek, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Furnace Creek, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Park_Service_ranger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Park Service ranger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hiking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesquite,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mesquite, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mesquite, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponce,_Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ponce, Puerto Rico"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Telecommunications", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Telecommunications", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/death-valley-national-park.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761159", "eventUri": "eng-9761159", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 1469, "textEnd": 1478}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-07-", "textStart": 503, "textEnd": 510}], "sentiment": -0.6470588235294117, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

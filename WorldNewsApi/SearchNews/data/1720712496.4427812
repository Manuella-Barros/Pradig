{"id": 232024592, "title": "Atletico Madrid president makes Man City transfer prediction for Julian Alvarez", "text": "Atletico's president has conceded it is unlikely that Julian Alvarez will leave Manchester City this summer. Alvarez has proved to be a bargain for Pep Guardiola since his \u00a314m move from River in January 2022, helping the team to a Treble in his first season at the Etihad before stepping up to take more responsibility last season covering for injuries to Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland. A world champion with City and with Argentina, the 24-year-old is hoping for more success this summer at both the Copa America and the Olympics. City's forward has already attracted interest in the summer market with clubs keen to tempt the player with promises of a bigger role than his current job where he serves predominantly as back-up to the best striker in the world in Haaland. Atletico and PSG are among the teams credited with an interest.

When asked about a potential transfer, Atletico president Enrique Cerezo did not sound confident that anyone would be able to prise Alvarez away. \"Julian Alvarez is a Manchester City player, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to move from there,\u201d he told Mexican outlet UnoTV. Guardiola has shown a willingness to include Alvarez alongside both De Bruyne and Haaland in his City XIs at various points over the past two years, but the Argentine is likely to begin next season needing to fight for selection again.", "summary": "Manchester City striker Julian Alvarez is said to be interesting a number of top European clubs this summer", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/atletico-madrid-president-makes-man-29321301", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29239746.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2154608546.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:00:00", "author": "Simon Bajkowski", "authors": ["Simon Bajkowski"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.051}

The court found that Judge Dianne Hensley, a justice of the peace in McLennan County, has standing to sue the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, which gave her a public warning \u201ccasting doubt on her capacity to act impartially\u201d in her judicial role. The 8-1 decision sends the case back to the state court of appeals, which had dismissed the lawsuit, saying Judge Hensley had failed to exhaust her internal-review options. Hiram Sasser, First Liberty Institute executive general counsel, which represents Judge Hensley, cheered the high court\u2019s decision as a victory for religious freedom. \u201cJudge Hensley\u2019s way of reconciling her religious beliefs while meeting the needs of her community is not only legal but should stand as a model for public officials across Texas,\u201d Mr. Sasser said. \u201cThis is a great victory for Judge Hensley and renews her opportunity to seek justice under the religious liberty protections of the law.\u201d The Waco-based judge stopped performing marriage ceremonies after the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges legalizing same-sex unions, as did all other judges in the county at the time. \u201cConcerned that couples would lack access to a low-cost wedding, Hensley decided to resume conducting weddings for opposite-sex couples and to refer same-sex couples to others she and her staff identified in the area as willing to perform the marriages for the same $100 fee she charged,\u201d said Chief Justice Nathan Hecht in the 28-page majority opinion. \u201cShe prepared a form for her staff to hand out, which explained that she did not perform same-sex weddings because of her religious beliefs and provided contact information for others who would,\u201d he said. After learning of her marriage-referral system in a newspaper article, the commission investigated and issued a public warning against her in 2019. Instead of requesting an appeal hearing by the Special Court of Review, she sued under the free-speech clause and the Texas Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Justice Hecht said Judge Hensley wasn\u2019t required to ask for an appeal hearing before filing her lawsuit. \u201cThe SCR could not have finally decided whether Hensley is entitled to the relief sought in this case or awarded the relief TRFRA provides if it is determined that her claim has merit,\u201d he said in the ruling. \u201cNor could the SCR have mooted Hensley\u2019s TRFRA claim. Hensley was not required to further exhaust her remedy by appeal to a court that could not afford her the relief TRFRA provides to successful claimants before suing in a court that can. #Breaking: Waco judge can sue over reprimand for not marrying gay couples, Texas Supreme Court rules.

In a concurring opinion, Justice James Blaylock said the high court should have immediately ruled that the commission lacked the authority to sanction judges who refer same-sex couples to other officiants. \u201cObergefell gave same-sex couples a right to marriage,\u201d he said, joined by Justice John Devine. \u201cIt did not give same-sex couples a right to coerce a judge with religious objections to officiate same-sex weddings. Nor did it give the Texas Judicial Conduct Commission the right to punish a Christian judge who politely directs same-sex couples down the street.\u201d", "summary": "The Texas Supreme Court cleared the way Friday for a lawsuit filed by a judge who was sanctioned for refusing to conduct gay-marriage ceremonies herself but referred same-sex couples to other nearby officiants who did.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jun/28/texas-supreme-court-sides-with-judge-sanctioned-fo/", "image": "https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/06/11/Census_Same_Sex_Marriage_15885.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:28:24", "author": "Valerie Richardson", "authors": ["Valerie Richardson"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.089}

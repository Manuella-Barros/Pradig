But if you'd rather not opt for costly, invasive or uncomfortable treatment in order to achieve a more voluminous pout, TikTok creators are going wild for a lip hack that has impressive plumping results - with no surgery required.

While UK creator @evepilee called using hyaluronic acid and Vaseline her 'fave lip plumping hack'.

Speaking to FEMAIL, Face the Future's Clinic Lead Kimberley Medd shared her expert opinion. The good news is that she rates hyaluronic acid for giving a plump 'glass lips' finish. She explained: 'The humectant property of HA means it's able to hold a thousand times its weight in water, creating a blurred, glass lip finish.' 'Hyaluronic Acid is an incredibly popular skincare ingredient, and most of us probably have it included somewhere in our routines, whether we realise it or not!' she explained. Copy link to paste in your message Copy link to paste in your message TikTok creator @darcieratcliff shared her method for plumper lips without filler and the TikTokker also opts for 'lots of lip balm' to keep her lips hydrated Our lips are the thinnest part of skin on the body, with only three to five cellular layers in comparison to the 16 cellular levels of skin on the rest of our body, according to skincare expert Medd. She explains how Hyaluronic Acid is a great ingredient to combat dry lips by filling in the cracked dry lines and to keep the lip skin cells hydrated. 'Lips that are dehydrated won't appear as plump, so hyaluronic acid can be a great way to volumise your pout with essential moisture. 'Hyaluronic Acid can also benefit the lips through being anti-ageing, promoting healthier skin and collagen support.' Medd also believes this skincare ingredient is worth the hype, explaining: 'Hyaluronic Acid is a naturally occurring polysaccharide in the body. 'It resides in the large spaces between our skin cells, where is gets to work doing a number of jobs. 'It's not the newest, flashiest or most expensive ingredient out there, but it's tried and tested. Think of it as the old faithful in your regime.'

He unpacked the results of applying hyaluronic acid onto your pout by referencing a study. In the video, he tells viewers: 'So you've started applying hyaluronic acid and your Vaseline to get bigger lips, but exactly what sort of results can you expect, is there any science or research behind this.' He then goes on to share some before and after lips shots, with the explanation: 'This study basically looks at women between the ages of 20 and 40, and gave them a lip serum to apply twice a day, one of the main components of which was hyaluronic acid.' He continued: 'In order to be eligible for the study they had to have no history of lip fillers. So you can see one of the powers of hyaluronic acid here on display is a powerful humectant. 'It can hold up to 1,000 time it weight in water and when your lips are adequately hydrated one could argue that you might have had half a ml of filler in your lips - just look at the results.' Plumper lips were high on beauty wish lists way before the likes of before Kylie Jenner and her lip kits boosted their popularity. The origins of lip filler can be traced back to the 20th century when physicians (somewhat riskily) experimented with injectable materials like paraffin and silicone to enhance lip volume.

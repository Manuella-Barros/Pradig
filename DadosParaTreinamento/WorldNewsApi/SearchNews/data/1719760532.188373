{"id": 225001740, "title": "Strait of Malacca: Could the Strategic Waterway Be China's Achilles Heel?", "text": "The Strait of Malacca, a bustling trade route connecting the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, has long been touted as a strategic weak point for China.In a regional crisis, such as an invasion of Bejing-claimed Taiwan, the U.S. and Indian navies could potentially blockade the strait, the argument goes, which narrows to just 40 miles at its narrowest point.This scenario, known as the \"Malacca Dilemma\" among political scientists, posits a blockade that would disrupt China's naval communications and severely restrict energy imports from the Middle East.For about a decade, China has been moving to reduce the potential impact of such a blockade, including turning its navy into a blue water force and constructing overland oil and gas routes such as those in neighboring Myanmar, Collin Koh, a maritime security expert at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, told Newsweek.Yet, more than 60 percent of Chinese imports by value are transported by sea, with some 80 percent of its oil imports coming through the Malacca Strait.Defending its seaborne trade route in the strait and beyond would mean sailing far from China's mainland bases and into waters bordering its Southeast Asian neighbors. It's unclear whether these coastal nations would sit on the sidelines if China moved its warships through nearby waters to challenge a blockade, Koh said. It's also uncertain whether these smaller states \"can hope to influence events in any practical, realistic manner should the elephants decide to fight it out for control of the waterways.\"There is also the matter of economic interdependence. Even if the U.S. further weans itself off China trade, the world's second-largest economy is the top trading partner of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and these states may not be willing to bear the economic costs, Koh added.Tensions have further increased between China and self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing views as its territory, after Chinese naval, ground-based, and air forces last week carried out drills simulating a blockade around the island in response to the inauguration of Taiwan's China-skeptic President Lai Ching-te.Chinese President Xi Jinping has repeatedly said unification with Taiwan is inevitable, and U.S. officials believe he has instructed the People's Liberation Army to be capable of an invasion by 2027. Washington is Taiwan's primary arms supplier but maintains a policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" meant to leave China guessing whether it would commit U.S. forces to directly defend Taiwan.The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC), an independent government agency, recommended in its 2022 report that Congress have the Defense Department draw up a classified report on the feasibility, practicality, and military requirements \"for an effective blockade of energy shipments bound for China in the event of military conflict involving China.\"When asked whether the Pentagon had produced such a report, a spokesperson told Newsweek the Department of Defense does not comment on classified information or potential wartime scenarios.The Chinese embassy in the U.S. did not immediately respond to a written request for comment.China lacks a blue water navy comparable to that of the U.S. and would be largely hemmed in by a blockade, coupled with the First Island Chain of U.S.-allied island countries extending south from Japan.However, some experts argue that China's vulnerability in the strait is overstated. Eyck Freymann, a Hoover fellow at Stanford University, said in a December talk that \"blockaders must either accommodate neutral states or coerce them into participating.\"\"Both approaches are costly and undermine the operation's effectiveness over time,\" he argued. He pointed to ways neutral parties could erode the effectiveness of a blockade, pointing out the price incentives to do so would be \"massive.\"Workarounds may take the form of alternative routes via land borders or ship crews simply selling their cargo to China after sailing through a blockade.Freymann also pointed to the ease with which Russian oil tankers have continued to sell oil at prices in defiance of Western sanctions by turning off or hacking their Automatic Identification System, which maritime regulations require ships to use in order to broadcast their position for safety reasons.China is taking steps to scale back its reliance on maritime oil shipments.The country plans to double its nuclear capacity by constructing 150 reactors by 2035, positioning itself to overtake the U.S. as the leading nuclear power producer.Meanwhile, China has also been increasing its economic and energy ties with Russia. Beijing now enjoys significant leverage over its isolated neighbor following Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.That year, Russia overtook Saudi Arabia as China's biggest oil supplier, and China's fuel-hungry economy is also benefiting from discounted natural gas piped in through Russia's Power of Siberia pipeline.The USCC's 2023 report states: \"China's ability to buy cheap overland fossil fuel commodities from Russia has also reduced Beijing's vulnerability to a blockade on its extensive oil imports that transverse the Strait of Malacca.\"", "summary": "China has been moving to reduce the potential impact of blockades by turning its navy into a blue water force and constructing overland oil and gas routes.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/could-strait-malacca-china-achilles-heel-1905112", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2399612/uss-nimitz-transits-strait-malacca.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:06:10", "author": "Micah Mccartney", "authors": ["Micah Mccartney"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.152}

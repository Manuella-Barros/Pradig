Shekhar is a Santhal, and works as a doctor in Pakur, close to Ranchi. One of the stories in his collection, 'November Is the Month of Migrations', was about a Santhal woman who trades her body for Rs 50 and some bread pakoras.\n\nThe campaign to vilify Shekhar's work has been gathering force, with trolling, open letters, Facebook parody pages, threats and effigy burning. The literary and cultural activists who led that campaign had wanted to get his award revoked, even though it was for a different book. The opposition, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, called for a ban on Friday in the assembly, and by evening, BJP chief minister Raghubar Das had ordered all copies to be seized, and legal action taken against the writer.\n\nAnother group of Adivasi writers and academics who wrote a strong letter protesting the persecution of Shekhar, said they passed the allegedly \"pornographic\" story around to several Santhal friends. \"All of them, without exception, said the story was painful, disturbing and sad, which made them reflect on the difficult, complex lives our Adivasi women live.

That's why I opposed this harassment,\" says Ruby Hembrom, founder of the publishing house adivaani, dedicated to Adivasi writing. In her view, Shekhar's opponents \"just got lucky\" in getting political attention. \"None of the politicians opposing the book is likely to have read it. This is just an orchestrated move by a small group of people, who convinced portions of the community that Shekhar's writing degraded them,\" she adds. But even a small group can exert disproportionate influence, if they suggest that they 'speak for a larger group'.\"That's because few states have any incentive to protect the writer,\" says writer Nilanjana Roy.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3357664", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T12:45:00Z", "sim": 0.8117647171020508, "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "title": "The Times of India", "id": "1185"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "12:45:00", "url": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/books/features/jharkhand-bans-book-on-tribals-after-it-is-dubbed-porn/articleshow/60042878.cms", "storyUri": "eng-3357664", "id": "8915887", "image": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-60042999/60042999.jpg?142883", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "12:45:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

(File) Toilet: Ek Prem Katha box office collection day 1: Akshay Kumar's film is expected to cross the Rs 10 crore markDisney CEO sees a future without Netflix, Comcast or DirecTVVIP 2 movie review: The phenomenon that is Dhanush rules hearts\n\nWith support from the Opposition, the Jharkhand government on Friday told the Assembly that it would take strict action against Sowvendra Shekhar Hansda, a Santhali novelist and government doctor, for allegedly portraying Santhal women in poor light in one of his books. The action could include registration of FIR against him and seizure of copies of the book, The Adivasi Will Not Dance, besides a ban.\n\nThe action comes in the wake of a protest by some tribal groups in Pakur, where Hansda is deputed in the Additional Public Health Centre of Pakuria block. Tribal activist Gladson Dungdung has also criticised his work, though maintaining that harassing someone is not right. An online petition campaign by a woman from Dumka, who works in Delhi, has been launched seeking withdrawal of Hansda's Sahitya Akademi award. Hansda had received the Sahitya Akademi Yuva Puraskar 2015 for his book, The Mysterious Ailment of Rupi Baskey.\n\nDespite repeated efforts, Hansda could not be contacted. The matter was raised in the Assembly on Friday by BJP's Ghatshila MLA Laxman Tudu. Referring to a news report published in Hindi daily Hindustan, Tudu said the contents of the book were highly insulting towards Santhal women. \"As per the news report, one of the stories paints such an objectionable picture that action must be taken. The story says that the woman agreed to go to bed with anybody in lieu of something to eat. Is it not objectionable?\" he said.\n\nHemant Soren, leader of Opposition and acting chief of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, supported Tudu's contention and demanded that action be taken against Hansda as he was a government doctor.\n\nHolding that the sentiment of the entire House, across party lines, was in favour of action against Hansda, BJP chief whip in the Assembly Radha Krishna Kishore said: \"The matter requires action under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.\"\n\nPresenting the government's stand on the matter in the House, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Saryu Roy said: \"The government is aware of the development and was already planning action in this regard.\" The Deputy Commissioner of Pakur has been asked to inquire into the matter and take strict action, he told the House. He, however, rejected Soren's proposal to bring the book in the House, saying it was a case where the book should be banned.\n\nAccording to the news report, the third story in Hansda's book The Adivasi Will Not Dance talks about a Santhal woman who agrees to go to bed with a man in exchange for food. The report also mentions that the Home Department has been informed about anger prevailing in Santhal Pargana region due to the book. Some tribal groups have burnt effigies and taken out marches in protest.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-12", "textEnd": 63, "textStart": 48}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3357664", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T00:15:00Z", "sim": 0.7686274647712708, "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "title": "The Indian Express", "id": "1155"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "00:15:00", "url": "http://indianexpress.com/article/india/will-act-against-santhali-novelist-jharkhand-govt/", "storyUri": "eng-3357664", "id": "8723456", "image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/08/759-sowmendra.jpg?w=759", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "00:15:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

The author says that the series of short stories in the book highlights the plight of the state's santhal population, especially women, who are subjected to inhuman sexual exploitation when they migrate to other states for work.\n\nThe chief minister said that he decided to ban the book so that the \"mostly illiterate, mostly non-readers of English who are the people of Jharkhand can be protected from this book,\" reports The Telegraph.\n\nOn Friday, at the Jharkhand Assembly, the opposition Jharkhand Mukti Morcha called for a ban of the book. By evening, the chief minister then directed Chief Secretary Rajbala Verma to seize all copies of the book.\n\nThe chief minister also ordered that a First Information Report be filed against Shekhar, PTI reported.\n\n\"The chief minister late Friday night asked the chief secretary to order banning the book. He has also sought legal actions against the author, printer and publisher of the book,\" a CMO official told Hindustan Times.\n\nThe campaign to vilify the author's work has been gathering force. In the last couple of weeks, the author has faced trolling, threats, open letters and burning of his effigy.\n\nHowever, he has his supporters too. A group of Adivasi writers and academics wrote a strong letter protesting the persecution of Shekhar. Times Of India reports that the writers in their letter said that they have passed around the book to their Santhal friends, and none of them found it to be 'pornographic'.\n\n\"All of them, without exception, said the story was painful, disturbing and sad, which made them reflect on the difficult, complex lives our Adivasi women live. This story could be about exploitation, choices borne of desperate conditions or free will, but all it did was evoke tears, a lump in the throat and profound grief. Not one of the readers said the story sexually aroused them,\" said the letter.\n\nRuchir Joshi, in his editorial for The Hindu, writes that when the book was published two years ago, it caused no upheaval among the Adivasis of the State. Calling the argument for banning the book a 'lie', Joshi writes, \"It's a lie because a book cannot 'insult' a religion, a god, a prophet, a people, an ethnic group, a caste, or a country; a book is a book, and you can choose to read it or not; a book doesn't open by itself, it stays shut until someone chooses to pick it up and read it; a book does not collar you in the street or on a village path; a book does not spit in your face, 'outrage your modesty' or assault you.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3357664", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T03:25:00Z", "sim": 0.7490196228027344, "source": {"uri": "huffingtonpost.in", "title": "Huffington Post India", "id": "3561"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "04:45:00", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/08/12/why-the-jharkhand-government-banned-a-book-on-tribals-published_a_23075846/", "storyUri": "eng-3357664", "id": "8872858", "image": "https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/448x236+0+75/resize/1200x630!/format/jpg/quality/85/http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F9ceaa7f58724f438e9ed6e45c60c584e%2F205562470%2FScreen%2BShot%2B2017-08-13%2Bat%2B8.54.33%2BAM.png", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "03:25:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

A direction to register an FIR has also been given.\n\nParliamentary Affairs Minister Saryu Roy told the House that the Deputy Commissioner of Pakur was directed to seize available copies and such seizures would take place anywhere in the state.\n\nRoy also said the government intended to constitute a committee of litt\u00e9rateurs to review the material at hand. \"He is an award-winning writer... Therefore, it would be proper if we get it reviewed by some litt\u00e9rateurs,\" he said. However, there was no announcement of constitution of any such committee.\n\nTalking to The Indian Express over phone, Hansda said: \"I wrote it with a clean conscience. Had it been so objectionable, my book would have not been published and liked and acceptable to people.\" Asked about the ban on his book and possible FIR against him, Hansda refused to comment.\n\nThe matter was raised in the Assembly on Friday by a BJP MLA, based on a report in Hindustan. The Opposition too demanded strict action. The government had then said that strict action would be taken against Hansda, who is a government doctor at Additional Public Health Centre in Pakuria Block of Pakur district.\n\nWhile support for Hansda has been pouring in from his friends and readers, some tribal activists like Gladson Dungdung have criticised his work.\n\nIt was pointed out in the Assembly that one story in the book The Adivasi Will Not Dance portrays a Santhal woman as having agreed to sleep with a person in exchange for something to eat.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: Jharkhand Santhali author", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-13", "textEnd": 63, "textStart": 48}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3357664", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T21:38:00Z", "sim": 0.6980392336845398, "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "title": "The Indian Express", "id": "1155"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "21:38:00", "url": "http://indianexpress.com/article/india/jharkhand-bans-santhali-authors-book-4794293/", "storyUri": "eng-3357664", "id": "8846673", "image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/08/hansda.jpg?w=759", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "21:38:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

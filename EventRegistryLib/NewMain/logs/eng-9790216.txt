I think we all are. There has been a lot of talk and words over the last 12 months, even two years.\n\n\"I am looking to settle that on Tuesday and give it my best performance.\n\n\"This is my fifth major championship final. I don't miss these because I am good at what I do. I will show that in the final.\n\n\"I have been picturing this for my whole life. It is going to be another day in the office for me.

And give our sport the best crowd experience - that's my job.\n\n\"Jakob will try to win, I will try to win, and we will see who wins.\"\n\nGreat Britain will have two men in contention for a 1500m medal after Kerr's fellow Scotsman Neil Gourley also booked his place in the final.\n\nBritish gold medal favourite Keely Hodgkinson cruised through to Monday's women's 800m final after finishing fastest after all the semis at Stade de France.\n\nTomorrow is going to be the most fun. There's no pressure. I'm already there. I'll give my absolute everything and whatever comes of that comes\n\nThe Tokyo 2020 silver medallist laid down one minute 56.86 seconds in the last of the three sessions, quicker than a personal best for Ethiopia's Tsige Duguma who was second of the overall 24-woman field in 1:57.47.\n\nHodgkinson said: \"I've been thinking about it every day for the past year. Obviously I don't want to overthink it too much, I have to go out and do what I know I can do. If I can commit to that, I think I will get what I want.But you never know.\n\n\"As you can see in the semis, literally anything can happen. I was just happy to get through with no problems.\n\n\"I get nervous the whole time. The heats I was nervous, tonight I was nervous. Tomorrow is going to be the most fun. There's no pressure. I'm already there. I'll give my absolute everything and whatever comes of that comes.\"\n\nHodgkinson had not ruled out all three British women making the final, but it was not meant to be for Jemma Reekie, the Tokyo 2020 fourth-place finisher, or 17-year-old debutant Phoebe Gill, who respectively finished eighth and 13th of the 24 semi-finalists.\n\nLyles' former housemate Matthew Hudson-Smith also sealed his spot in the men's 400m semi-final after winning the first heat.\n\nThe Wolverhampton athlete was forced to miss the Tokyo 2020 Olympics after a series of injuries and setbacks, and courageously came back from a mental health crisis to win his first major medal with bronze at the 2022 World Championships, upgrading to silver in 2023.\n\nHe said: \"It was an easy run, I was just going for the win and trying to make it as easy as possible and get ready for the semi-finals.\n\n\"I just wanted to execute my race plan as comfortably as possible.\n\n\"Preparation has been really good, so now I just go for the win.\"\n\nThere was major news ahead of the fourth heat, when it was announced that Bahamian defending Olympic champion Steven Gardiner had dropped out.\n\nGreat Britain's Charlie Dobson also made it through as top man in the sixth and final heat.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "press_association@aol.co.uk", "name":

At times, they've insisted they don't know each other well enough to dislike the other.\n\nYou don't need to be a track junkie to enjoy a great rivalry like this one, which hits its apex Tuesday. Expect the fireworks to fly in the showdown between the Norwegian defending Olympic champion and the Scottish reigning world champion at the Paris Games.\n\n\"They should be expecting one of the most vicious and hardest 1,500s the sport's seen in a very long time,\" Kerr said Sunday, after Ingebrigtsen edged him out in a semifinal that shouldn't have meant all that much but still probably did.\n\nAsked if he agreed with that assessment, well -- of course Ingebrigtsen had his own take.\n\n\"I mean, racing is what you want it to be,\" he said. \"I thrive in the competitive scene. That's why I do this. So maybe there's a difference among us. Some people like other stuff.\"\n\nA look at some of the highlights -- and lowlights -- from the past year between Ingebrigtsen and Kerr.\n\nIngebrigtsen eggs on the crowd in semifinals at world championships\n\nAs he was rounding the final turn in the semifinals of last year's world championships, Ingebrigtsen was more focused on the crowd than the competition.\n\nHe turned to the stands and gestured with his arms for the fans to get out of their seats. Then, paying only scant attention, he cruised past Kerr and a few others to finish first. It was an amazing or, to others, incredibly disrespectful bit of showmanship that set the stage for ...\n\nKerr got the last laugh by taking down Ingebrigtsen in the final\n\nIngebrigtsen went out to the early lead and set the pace in the final. Kerr hung back until the final 200 meters, when he sling-shotted past the favorite to win in a season-best time of 3:29.38.\n\nIt marked the second straight year Ingebrigtsen got beaten by a Brit in a race at worlds he was expected to win. (Jake Wightman won in 2022.) Afterward, Ingebrigtsen said he was sick, and not feeling 100%, which annoyed people who thought it took away from Kerr's victory.\n\n\"Not being 100 percent and not feeling 100 percent when it really matters, it's disappointing,\" Ingebrigtsen said.\n\nKerr suggests Ingebrigtsen's success is a product of pacers\n\nThis is where it gets very \"inside track,\" but Kerr and others suggest Ingebrigtsen's success over all these years has been largely thanks to so-called \"pacers\" -- runners who set a certain pace for a race, then drop out of the mix before the end.\n\nThey are less common at major championships such as worlds and the Olympics, which leaves the top contenders to determine the tactics with no help. Some say it explains why Ingebrigtsen has lost in what's supposed to be his best race at the last two world championships.\n\nIngebrigtsen grew annoyed when asked a question last summer about running without pacers: \"When the pacemakers drop out, I'm the pacemaker. So every race is practice,\" he said.\n\nKerr seized on this in \"The Sunday Plodcast\" last December, saying Ingebrigtsen was paced for his Olympic title three years ago by Timothy Cheruiyot. (Cheruiyot did, indeed, hold the lead for most of this race. But he was running to win and finished second.)\n\n\"I do think people will start realizing that now but I don't think he will because the ego's pretty high on this one,\" Kerr said of the pacemaker digs.\n\nKerr's reaction to Ingebrigtsen's comment about becoming the pacemaker himself was toxic, too.\n\n\"I was like, 'Oh, you have no idea. You must be surrounded by so many 'yes men' that you don't realize that you have weaknesses and I think that was part of his downfall,\" Kerr said.\n\nTuesday's race probably won't be the end of the trash talk\n\nIngebrigtsen also said earlier this year he could beat Kerr blindfolded at 3,000 meters.\n\nIf Kerr beats Ingebrigtsen at 1,500 on Tuesday, he will have the gold medal, but Ingebrigtsen's supporters will point out that the Scotsman will still be 4-13 lifetime against their guy at 1,500 meters and the mile.\n\nIngebrigtsen also has a pair world titles at 5,000 meters and is entered in that race this year, too. Kerr says that's not the real prize among distance racers.\n\nIngebrigtsen said he and Kerr have never spoken.\n\n\"I just think some things that they're saying are on the border of lying and maybe being a coward,\" he said, \"because nobody's told me anything to my face.\"\n\nKerr also says he has no real relationship with his main rival.\n\n\"He's trying to be the best in the world and so am I, and if that ruffles some feathers that's OK with me,\" Kerr said.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType":

Ingebrigtsen, who likes to lead from the front, chose to hang at the back of the pack through the first 300 metres. However, he had taken the lead by the halfway stage, running slightly ahead of Kerr.\n\nThe pair kicked it up a gear as they crossed the line for the final lap, ending in a very marginal victory for the Norwegian. They are considered the favourites for the gold medal in the final which takes place on Tuesday.\n\n\"I got myself in a high position which was the goal and then just relax really,\" Kerr said after the semifinal.\n\n\"It's top six in a race of 12 people. I'm here to do a lot better than that so it's having the right mindset coming in and also making sure that you are giving the respect to the competition.\n\n\"I'm feeling great.

Kerr replied by saying the 23-year-old lacked manners. After that, Ingebrigtsen said he could win blindfolded.\n\nIt is a mystery as to who will win it. Kerr has not competed in the 1500m all year, choosing instead to race in other distances, leading Ingebrigtsen to say earlier this week that Kerr is known as \"the Brit who doesn't compete.\"\n\nThe only time they have raced against each other since last year's championships was in Eugene, Oregon in May in the prestigious Prefontaine Mile, which ended with a Kerr victory.", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "connor_o_halloran@espn.co.uk", "name": "Connor O'Halloran", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Athletics_Championships_\u2013_Men's_1500_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2019 World Athletics Championships \u2013 Men's 1500 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Kerr_(runner)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Kerr (runner)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Ingebrigtsen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jakob Ingebrigtsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "300 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1500_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "1500 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eugene, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eugene, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0804%2Fr1368492_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790216", "eventUri": "eng-9790216", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

At times, they've insisted they don't know each other well enough to dislike the other.\n\nYou don't need to be a track junkie to enjoy a great rivalry like this one, which hits its apex Tuesday. Expect the fireworks to fly in the showdown between the Norwegian defending Olympic champion and the Scottish reigning world champion at the Paris Games.\n\n\"They should be expecting one of the most vicious and hardest 1,500s the sport's seen in a very long time,\" Kerr said Sunday, after Ingebrigtsen edged him out in a semifinal that shouldn't have meant all that much but still probably did.\n\nAsked if he agreed with that assessment, well -- of course Ingebrigtsen had his own take.\n\n\"I mean, racing is what you want it to be,\" he said. \"I thrive in the competitive scene. That's why I do this. So maybe there's a difference among us. Some people like other stuff.\"\n\nA look at some of the highlights -- and lowlights -- from the past year between Ingebrigtsen and Kerr.\n\nAs he was rounding the final turn in the semifinals of last year's world championships, Ingebrigtsen was more focused on the crowd than the competition.\n\nHe turned to the stands and gestured with his arms for the fans to get out of their seats. Then, paying only scant attention, he cruised past Kerr and a few others to finish first. It was an amazing or, to others, incredibly disrespectful bit of showmanship that set the stage for ...\n\nIngebrigtsen went out to the early lead and set the pace in the final. Kerr hung back until the final 200 meters, when he sling-shotted past the favorite to win in a season-best time of 3:29.38.\n\nIt marked the second straight year Ingebrigtsen got beaten by a Brit in a race at worlds he was expected to win. (Jake Wightman won in 2022.) Afterward, Ingebrigtsen said he was sick, and not feeling 100%, which annoyed people who thought it took away from Kerr's victory.\n\n\"Not being 100 percent and not feeling 100 percent when it really matters, it's disappointing,\" Ingebrigtsen said.\n\nThis is where it gets very \"inside track,\" but Kerr and others suggest Ingebrigtsen's success over all these years has been largely thanks to so-called \"pacers\" -- runners who set a certain pace for a race, then drop out of the mix before the end.\n\nThey are less common at major championships such as worlds and the Olympics, which leaves the top contenders to determine the tactics with no help. Some say it explains why Ingebrigtsen has lost in what's supposed to be his best race at the last two world championships.\n\nIngebrigtsen grew annoyed when asked a question last summer about running without pacers: \"When the pacemakers drop out, I'm the pacemaker. So every race is practice,\" he said.\n\nKerr seized on this in \"The Sunday Plodcast\" last December, saying Ingebrigtsen was paced for his Olympic title three years ago by Timothy Cheruiyot. (Cheruiyot did, indeed, hold the lead for most of this race. But he was running to win and finished second.)\n\n\"I do think people will start realizing that now but I don't think he will because the ego's pretty high on this one,\" Kerr said of the pacemaker digs.\n\nKerr's reaction to Ingebrigtsen's comment about becoming the pacemaker himself was toxic, too.\n\n\"I was like, 'Oh, you have no idea. You must be surrounded by so many 'yes men' that you don't realize that you have weaknesses and I think that was part of his downfall,\" Kerr said.\n\nIngebrigtsen also said earlier this year he could beat Kerr blindfolded at 3,000 meters.\n\nIf Kerr beats Ingebrigtsen at 1,500 on Tuesday, he will have the gold medal, but Ingebrigtsen's supporters will point out that the Scotsman will still be 4-13 lifetime against their guy at 1,500 meters and the mile.\n\nIngebrigtsen also has a pair world titles at 5,000 meters and is entered in that race this year, too. Kerr says that's not the real prize among distance racers.\n\nIngebrigtsen said he and Kerr have never spoken.\n\n\"I just think some things that they're saying are on the border of lying and maybe being a coward,\" he said, \"because nobody's told me anything to my face.\"\n\nKerr also says he has no real relationship with his main rival.\n\n\"He's trying to be the best in the world and so am I, and if that ruffles some feathers that's OK with me,\" Kerr said.", "source": {"uri": "beaumontenterprise.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beaumont Enterprise"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eddie_pells@beaumontenterprise.com", "name": "Eddie Pells", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikael_Ingebrigtsen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mikael Ingebrigtsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sam Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Kerr_(runner)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Kerr (runner)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Ingebrigtsen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jakob Ingebrigtsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Wightman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Wightman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacemaker_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pacemaker (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Cheruiyot", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Timothy Cheruiyot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scotsman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Scotsman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_cardiac_pacemaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial cardiac pacemaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1500_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1500 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5000_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "5000 metres"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Running", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/41/25/41/25516132/3/rawImage.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790216", "eventUri": "eng-9790216", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

2020 fourth-place finisher, or 17-year-old debutant Phoebe Gill, who respectively finished eighth and 13th of the 24 semi-finalists.\n\nLyles' former housemate Matthew Hudson-Smith also sealed his

They're claiming what the want to achieve, they're saying what they want to do.\n\n'This is what I love to encourage kids: get out of the shadows of hiding how good you feel, and step out and proclaim it, speak it. Be a trailblazer.\n\n'There is a reason why Josh Kerr is world champion, because he does that and thinks that way. There is a reason Jakob Ingebrigtsen will go down as one of the greatest distance runners in the world.\n\n'I think this conservatism that people want, and they still want great performances is an overreach and I think at the end of the day I ask these athletes to entertain me. If you ask me if these two guys are entertaining, oh yes they are.'\n\nThe 41-year-old went as far as to suggest that almost every athlete shares the same view of their main rival, but don't wish to publicly express it.\n\nBut Aussie track legend John Steffensen says that the rivalry is just what the sport needs\n\nHe added that every athlete shares the same attitude towards their rivals\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\n'Ninety nine per cent of athletes out there are thinking it, now start saying it and showing it,' he said.\n\n'You can't aim to be the best in the world and not be thinking it. We're asking them to hide it because for some reason it doesn't fit our social narrative of life.\n\n'We're watching a colosseum, we're watching the best athletes in the world go mano a mano and there is always going to be a level of this competitiveness and it gets shown in different ways.\n\n'It's about embracing every way an athlete shows how they compete.'\n\nIngebrigtsen and Kerr will meet in the 1500m men's semi-final on Sunday night in Paris.\n\nWatch every moment, every medal and every event of the Olympic Games Paris 2024 live, ad free and on demand with 4K on Stan Sport.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Kerr_(runner)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Kerr (runner)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Steffensen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Steffensen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stan (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Ingebrigtsen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jakob Ingebrigtsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_ace", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flying ace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-distance_running", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Long-distance running"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_rivalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College rivalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1500_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1500 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colosseum"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Long_Distance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Long Distance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/04/16/88141891-0-image-m-41_1722784545080.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790216", "eventUri": "eng-9790216", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

He lets the field charge off here. He's way down. Maybe he's got off a bit too relaxed,\" one said as Ingebrigtsen trailed the field.\n\n\"What a bizarre shot that is. He is almost superhuman. If anyone can do it, it's him.\"\n\nAnother was at a loss to explain Ingebrigtsen's tactics with 300m to go.\n\n\"He's almost dawdling at the back. That is almost bordering on arrogance. He's just sitting there,\" he said.\n\nOne athletics analyst's review of the race has gone viral on TikTok.\n\n\"Jakob Ingebrigtsen just did the most disrespectful thing to his opponents in the 1500m heats,\" he said.\n\n\"He doesn't even look like he's trying. There's no reason to do this other than the fact that he can.\n\n\"He sits at the back to conserve energy and to avoid the early sprint where runners can fall ... avoiding those risks. But he has no reason to go that far back. He's just chilling. He knows he's going to catch them. He knows he's better than everybody in the race and he can basically do what he wants.\n\n\"He's actually tactically worse than everyone else. He gets himself into bad positions. He just doesn't care because he knows he's going to get through.\"\n\nWith 500m to go the analyst says: \"This is where the disrespect really starts. We can see him sitting at the back which is fine, but then he deliberately gets himself into trouble. He's not at the back anymore and he's boxed in.\n\n\"There's no reason for him to want to do this, other than the fact he wants to show that he can do this. It's either a crazy move or just bad tactics.\"\n\nEven with 75m to go, Ingebrigtsen was in a fight for a spot in the top six -- with only the first six runners progressing straight to the semi-finals.\n\nWith a snap of his fingers, he moved up in front of the middle runners while the rest of his competitors fell away. Third position was all he needed.\n\nHis first test will come in Monday's semi-finals where he will be measured against world champion Josh Kerr for the first time.\n\nIngebrigtsen will be pinning his hopes on there being no repeat of the last two world championship finals.\n\nIn Eugene in 2022 and then in Budapest last year, the Norwegian was beaten down the home stretch by Britons, Jake Wightman and Kerr respectively.\n\nWightman is out of the Olympics with an injury, leaving Kerr to have Ingebrigtsen in his crosshairs even though their head-to-head record in 1500m finals stands at 8-1 in favour of the Norwegian.\n\nIt was Kerr who beat Ingebrigtsen the last time they clashed in the mile at the Diamond League meeting in Eugene in May.\n\nSince then, Ingebrigtsen has been unbeaten, winning the Diamond League 1500m on home soil in Oslo, European 1500m and 5000m titles in Rome, a Norwegian championships double, and that 1500m in Monaco.\n\n\"I think it's healthy for the event and the sport,\" Kerr said of his rivalry with the Norwegian.\n\n\"I don't mind about the rivalry. But this is my job, my job's to be out here and win medals. I am lucky that I have a chance to be here and compete. People are welcome to talk about it.\"\n\nWorld Athletics president Sebastian Coe said the 1500m had \"added piquancy because this is probably not a friendship made in heaven\".\n\n\"That doesn't bother me either. We know we want that kind of thing in the sport. So it really could be a race for the ages,\" Coe said.\n\nShould Ingebrigtsen claim back-to-back titles, he would be just the second man after Coe in 1980 and 1984 to win two Olympic 1500m golds.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikael_Ingebrigtsen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mikael Ingebrigtsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1500_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "1500 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Time in Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Ingebrigtsen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jakob Ingebrigtsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurosport", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eurosport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diamond League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Kerr_(runner)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Kerr (runner)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Wightman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Wightman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Coe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sebastian Coe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5000_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "5000 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eugene, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eugene, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oslo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oslo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/62bd4fb54f1c2b2b56252434b77c2e8c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790216", "eventUri": "eng-9790216", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

I think we all are. There has been a lot of talk and words over the last 12 months, even two years.\n\n\"I am looking to settle that on Tuesday and give it my best performance.\n\n\"This is my fifth major championship final.

And give our sport the best crowd experience - that's my job.\n\n\"Jakob will try to win, I will try to win, and we will see who wins.\"\n\nGreat Britain will have two men in contention for a 1500m medal after Kerr's fellow Scotsman Neil Gourley also booked his place in the final.\n\nBritish gold medal favourite Keely Hodgkinson cruised through to Monday's women's 800m final after finishing fastest after all the semis at Stade de France.\n\nTomorrow is going to be the most fun. There's no pressure. I'm already there. I'll give my absolute everything and whatever comes of that comes\n\nThe Tokyo 2020 silver medallist laid down one minute 56.86 seconds in the last of the three sessions, quicker than a personal best for Ethiopia's Tsige Duguma who was second of the overall 24-woman field in 1:57.47.\n\nHodgkinson said: \"I've been thinking about it every day for the past year. Obviously I don't want to overthink it too much, I have to go out and do what I know I can do. If I can commit to that, I think I will get what I want.But you never know.\n\n\"As you can see in the semis, literally anything can happen. I was just happy to get through with no problems.\n\n\"I get nervous the whole time. The heats I was nervous, tonight I was nervous. Tomorrow is going to be the most fun. There's no pressure. I'm already there. I'll give my absolute everything and whatever comes of that comes.\"\n\nHodgkinson had not ruled out all three British women making the final, but it was not meant to be for Jemma Reekie, the Tokyo 2020 fourth-place finisher, or 17-year-old debutant Phoebe Gill, who respectively finished eighth and 13th of the 24 semi-finalists.\n\nLyles' former housemate Matthew Hudson-Smith also sealed his spot in the men's 400m semi-final after winning the first heat.\n\nThe Wolverhampton athlete was forced to miss the Tokyo 2020 Olympics after a series of injuries and setbacks, and courageously came back from a mental health crisis to win his first major medal with bronze at the 2022 World Championships, upgrading to silver in 2023.\n\nHe said: \"It was an easy run, I was just going for the win and trying to make it as easy as possible and get ready for the semi-finals.\n\n\"I just wanted to execute my race plan as comfortably as possible.\n\n\"Preparation has been really good, so now I just go for the win.\"\n\nThere was major news ahead of the fourth heat, when it was announced that Bahamian defending Olympic champion Steven Gardiner had dropped out.\n\nGreat Britain's Charlie Dobson also made it through as top man in the sixth and final heat.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But Kerr's only concern was over-delivering on his media rounds on Saturday, and brushed off any suggestion the result will have any effect on the final.\n\nHe insists he has timed his preparation to perfection ahead of this Games and is ready to deliver a historic gold medal.\n\n\"Fans should expect the most competitive 1500m the sport has seen in a long time,\" he said.\n\n\"There's been a lot of talking words over the last few years, I'm looking to settle that on Tuesday and give it my best performance.\n\n\"I feel great. I felt really good today. I will be interested in the splits but other than getting in trouble with how much media I did a few days ago, it's been pretty smooth.\"\n\nThough the heavy favourites, Kerr and Ingebrigtsen are far from guaranteed a medal and Glasgow's Neil Gourley is among the chasing pack bidding to bag the win.\n\nGourley was in the final semi-final and finished strongly in 3:32.11 to leave himself dreaming of a podium spot.\n\n\"Something physical like a medal would definitely do it,\" he said when asked what would be considered success.\n\n\"I want to have the best race I've ever had in the final. If I do that, I am putting myself in with a chance of winning a medal. That has to be the goal.\"\n\nThe Stade de France is the place to be in the second week of the Games and if the 1500m final can match the 100m for drama, then we're in for all-timer.\n\nUSA's Noah Lyles came away with the gold after a seven-way photo finish to that saw all eight men run under 10 seconds for the first time in Olympic history.\n\nLyles was sluggish out of the blocks but came roaring back to take it by a nose hair from Jamaica's Kishane Thompson and USA's Fred Kerley, and add to the World Championship gold he won last year.\n\nThe final winning margin was just five thousandths of a second in what will go down as one of the all-time great Olympic races. Team GB's Zharnel Hughes and Louie Hinchliffe both went out in the semi-finals.\n\nKeely Hodgkinson will hope for less stress tonight but has promised a box-office 800m final after underlining why she is the favourite for gold by qualifying fastest.\n\nThe 22-year-old is bidding to upgrade the silver she won in Tokyo three years ago to gold and claim her first global major title.\n\nShe looked at the top of her game at the Stade de France last night, easing to victory in just 1:56.86s to leave her rivals trailing in her wake.\n\nVictory would see her emulate Kelly Holmes' 800m gold from 20 years ago and Hodgkinson says she can now look forward to the race after trying to block it from her mind until she qualified.\n\n\"It felt great. You can't talk about medals until you're in the final so I'm super happy to put that performance together,\" she said.\n\n\"All I can say is tune in for a really exciting race.\n\n\"You can't take any chances. It gave me a good practice but I just wanted to be safely qualified. Job done. We're in the final now. Mission is on.\n\n\"I have said it all year I really want to upgrade my silver.\n\n\"I think I am in the best shape physically, mentally, emotionally to do that, that I have been ever. So I just hope that I can put it together and let's see what we can do.\"\n\nMeanwhile, there was disappointment for Beith's Jemma Reekie after she failed to reach the final.\n\nReekie was sitting pretty in the lead at the end of the first lap but did not have the speed in her legs down the final 100m and eventually finished fifth.\n\n\"It was not good but I am going to go away and speak to my coach and get myself together,\" she said.\n\n\"I am in the best shape of my life and I made some mistakes there and that is what happens but I just need to go away and think about it.\n\n\"I ran well a few weeks ago. For sure, I've built on since then and training has gone better than what it was before and I need to go back and look at it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, 400m hopeful Matt Hudson-Smith surged into the semi-finals with a comfortable first-round victory.\n\nThe 29-year-old is among the favourites for gold after setting a new European record of 43.74s at the Diamond League race in London last month, and eased through in relatively comfortable 44.78s.\n\n\"It was an easy run, I was just going for the win , and try and make it as easy as possible and get ready for the semi-finals,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "kidderminstershuttle.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kidderminster Shuttle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Kerr_(runner)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Kerr (runner)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Ingebrigtsen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jakob Ingebrigtsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1500_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "1500 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gourley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neil Gourley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/800_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "800 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keely_Hodgkinson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keely Hodgkinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diamond League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemma_Reekie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jemma Reekie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zharnel_Hughes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zharnel Hughes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/400_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "400 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Holmes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Racing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.kidderminstershuttle.co.uk/resources/images/18385781/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790216", "eventUri": "eng-9790216", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

I think we all are. There has been a lot of talk and words over the last 12 months, even two years. I am looking to settle that on Tuesday and give it my best performance. I will show that in the final.\"\n\nThe quirks of the 1500m semi-final draw meant that the two men were also in the same race on Sunday, with Ingebrigtsen going to the front after 400m with Kerr following just behind him. But for the last 20m of the race the two were eyeballing each other as Ingebrigtsen took the win in 3min 32.38sec, with Kerr 0.08sec back. Now Kerr insists he is ready. \"I have been picturing this for my whole life,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, rarely has a woman cruised into an Olympic 800m final as effortlessly as Keely Hodgkinson, who showed again why she is a prohibitive favourite for gold on Monday evening. The 22-year-old from Wigan was running well within herself as she led from the front to win in 1min 56.86sec. There are whispers in the camp that she is in high 1:53 shape. If that is the case, no one will stop her in Paris.\n\nAfterwards she was nervous - but confident - about what lay ahead. \"I've been thinking about it every day for the past year,\" she said. \"I've felt nervous the whole time. The heats, I was nervous. Tonight I was nervous. Tomorrow is going to be the most fun. There's no pressure. I'm already there. I'll give my absolute everything and whatever comes of that comes.\"\n\nThere was no place in the Olympic final, however, for the 17-year-old Phoebe Gill or Jemma Reekie, who finished fourth and fifth in their respective semi-finals. Gill has had a tremendous season, and ran creditably as she came home in 1:58.47 behind Kenya's world champion Mary Moraa, who won in 1:57.86.\n\nReekie looked to have every chance in her semi-final and was second coming off the final bend before fading to fifth behind Tsige Duguma, who won in 1:57.47.\n\nEarlier Matt Hudson-Smith qualified for the 400m semi-finals by winning his heat in 44.78.

But Kerr's only concern was over-delivering on his media rounds on Saturday, and brushed off any suggestion the result will have any effect on the final.\n\nHe insists he has timed his preparation to perfection ahead of this Games and is ready to deliver a historic gold medal.\n\n\"Fans should expect the most competitive 1500m the sport has seen in a long time,\" he said.\n\n\"There's been a lot of talking words over the last few years, I'm looking to settle that on Tuesday and give it my best performance.\n\n\"I feel great. I felt really good today. I will be interested in the splits but other than getting in trouble with how much media I did a few days ago, it's been pretty smooth.\"\n\nThough the heavy favourites, Kerr and Ingebrigtsen are far from guaranteed a medal and Glasgow's Neil Gourley is among the chasing pack bidding to bag the win.\n\nGourley was in the final semi-final and finished strongly in 3:32.11 to leave himself dreaming of a podium spot.\n\n\"Something physical like a medal would definitely do it,\" he said when asked what would be considered success.\n\n\"I want to have the best race I've ever had in the final. If I do that, I am putting myself in with a chance of winning a medal. That has to be the goal.\"\n\nThe Stade de France is the place to be in the second week of the Games and if the 1500m final can match the 100m for drama, then we're in for all-timer.\n\nUSA's Noah Lyles came away with the gold after a seven-way photo finish to that saw all eight men run under 10 seconds for the first time in Olympic history.\n\nLyles was sluggish out of the blocks but came roaring back to take it by a nose hair from Jamaica's Kishane Thompson and USA's Fred Kerley, and add to the World Championship gold he won last year.\n\nThe final winning margin was just five thousandths of a second in what will go down as one of the all-time great Olympic races. Team GB's Zharnel Hughes and Louie Hinchliffe both went out in the semi-finals.\n\nKeely Hodgkinson will hope for less stress tonight but has promised a box-office 800m final after underlining why she is the favourite for gold by qualifying fastest.\n\nThe 22-year-old is bidding to upgrade the silver she won in Tokyo three years ago to gold and claim her first global major title.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will auto-play soon8Cancel Play now\n\nShe looked at the top of her game at the Stade de France last night, easing to victory in just 1:56.86s to leave her rivals trailing in her wake.\n\nVictory would see her emulate Kelly Holmes' 800m gold from 20 years ago and Hodgkinson says she can now look forward to the race after trying to block it from her mind until she qualified.\n\n\"It felt great. You can't talk about medals until you're in the final so I'm super happy to put that performance together,\" she said.\n\n\"All I can say is tune in for a really exciting race.\n\n\"You can't take any chances. It gave me a good practice but I just wanted to be safely qualified. Job done. We're in the final now. Mission is on.\n\n\"I have said it all year I really want to upgrade my silver.\n\n\"I think I am in the best shape physically, mentally, emotionally to do that, that I have been ever. So I just hope that I can put it together and let's see what we can do.\"\n\nMeanwhile, there was disappointment for Beith's Jemma Reekie after she failed to reach the final.\n\nReekie was sitting pretty in the lead at the end of the first lap but did not have the speed in her legs down the final 100m and eventually finished fifth.\n\n\"It was not good but I am going to go away and speak to my coach and get myself together,\" she said.\n\n\"I am in the best shape of my life and I made some mistakes there and that is what happens but I just need to go away and think about it.\n\n\"I ran well a few weeks ago. For sure, I've built on since then and training has gone better than what it was before and I need to go back and look at it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, 400m hopeful Matt Hudson-Smith surged into the semi-finals with a comfortable first-round victory.\n\nThe 29-year-old is among the favourites for gold after setting a new European record of 43.74s at the Diamond League race in London last month, and eased through in relatively comfortable 44.78s.\n\n\"It was an easy run, I was just going for the win , and try and make it as easy as possible and get ready for the semi-finals,\" he said.\n\nWatch every

I think we all are. There has been a lot of talk and words over the last 12 months, even two years.\n\n\"I am looking to settle that on Tuesday and give it my best performance.\n\n\"This is my fifth major championship final.

And give our sport the best crowd experience - that's my job.\n\n\"Jakob will try to win, I will try to win, and we will see who wins.\"\n\nGreat Britain will have two men in contention for a 1500m medal after Kerr's fellow Scotsman Neil Gourley also booked his place in the final.\n\nBritish gold medal favourite Keely Hodgkinson cruised through to Monday's women's 800m final after finishing fastest after all the semis at Stade de France.\n\nTomorrow is going to be the most fun. There's no pressure. I'm already there. I'll give my absolute everything and whatever comes of that comes\n\nThe Tokyo 2020 silver medallist laid down one minute 56.86 seconds in the last of the three sessions, quicker than a personal best for Ethiopia's Tsige Duguma who was second of the overall 24-woman field in 1:57.47.\n\nHodgkinson said: \"I've been thinking about it every day for the past year. Obviously I don't want to overthink it too much, I have to go out and do what I know I can do. If I can commit to that, I think I will get what I want.But you never know.\n\n\"As you can see in the semis, literally anything can happen. I was just happy to get through with no problems.\n\n\"I get nervous the whole time. The heats I was nervous, tonight I was nervous. Tomorrow is going to be the most fun. There's no pressure. I'm already there. I'll give my absolute everything and whatever comes of that comes.\"\n\nHodgkinson had not ruled out all three British women making the final, but it was not meant to be for Jemma Reekie, the Tokyo 2020 fourth-place finisher, or 17-year-old debutant Phoebe Gill, who respectively finished eighth and 13th of the 24 semi-finalists.\n\nLyles' former housemate Matthew Hudson-Smith also sealed his spot in the men's 400m semi-final after winning the first heat.\n\nThe Wolverhampton athlete was forced to miss the Tokyo 2020 Olympics after a series of injuries and setbacks, and courageously came

After months of jibes and taunts, of mind games and egos colliding, it was time for Britain's Josh Kerr vs. Norway's Jakob Ingebrigtsen.\n\nIt was a buildup boxing promoters would be proud of. A clash of the heavyweights: The reigning world champion against the reigning Olympic champion. One in red, one in blue. The question was, who would deliver the knockout punch?\n\nThey fought tough from the start. The pair went hell-for-leather -- Ingebrigtsen leading from the front and Kerr snapping at his heels. It was only near the end, once they had weathered each other's punches and fought the urge to fall that their bodies finally gave in. First it was Ingebrigtsen, falling away with 100 meters to go. Then it was Kerr, losing his speed when he most needed it; he had peaked before the line too.\n\nIt allowed for a third competitor to take the spoils. With just 20 meters to go, flying past them, unscathed and relatively unknown, was American Cole Hocker.\n\nThe 23-year-old from Indianapolis had showed guts to stick with the leaders, and when it came to the final moments, he used his finishing speed to produce one of the major upset victories of these Paris Games.\n\n\"I kind of told myself that I'm in this race too,\" Hocker said later. \"If they let me fly under the radar, then so be it. I think that might've just been the best.\"\n\nThe 1,500-meters event isn't like the 100-meter race, where athletes are aiming to set a time and hope nobody can match it. The 1,500 is more tactical and chesslike. It's about looking at the rest of the field, gauging your tank and knowing when to make your move. That's what made the buildup even more fascinating.\n\nIngebrigtsen had been burned by Kerr's tactics before. The feud started at last year's World Championships, where the Norwegian led from the start but didn't set the pace quite high enough, enabling Kerr to reel him in and speed ahead at the final bend. The only time the pair had raced since then, Kerr performed the opposite routine, leading from the front and keeping Ingebrigtsen behind him even until the line.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ingebrigtsen decided he wouldn't let Kerr dominate him again. Ingebrigtsen would dare to set a pace no one could match. Only, he miscalculated. \"I opened with a 54-second lap,\" Ingebrigtsen said. \"That wasn't the plan at all.\" The Norwegian was running so fast in the first lap that he was ahead of even Hicham El Guerrouj's 1998 world record.\n\n\"It was at least two seconds too fast,\" Ingebrigtsen said.\n\nIngebrigtsen wanted to drop back, to lean against the ropes and take a breather. His issue was he looked behind and saw Kerr. The Brit was on his shoulder; he wouldn't leave Ingebrigtsen be.\n\n\"It was about going into deep waters early and see who could survive,\" Kerr said.\n\nAnd so, they both dared to run faster than they had ever before. Their arms pumped and their feet pounded as they roared around the track. The rest of the field dared to follow too. By the end, seven of the 12 runners would set personal bests. Four of those were national records. If this were a boxing fight, it would be Hagler vs. Hearns. It was about going flat out and hoping you were left standing at the end.\n\nOnly, something was bound to give, and it happened with less than 200 meters to go. Ingebrigtsen began to slow up -- and suddenly, the regrets started kicking in. \"I ruined it for myself by going way too hard,\" he later said.\n\nKerr looked set for gold, set for bragging rights, set for glory. He fired round the bend and turned for home. But his speed began to sap too.\n\nIt allowed a gap for Hocker on the inside, and he didn't need a second invitation to rip up the script. \"It might be an upset to a lot of people, but if you've been following my season, you'd know I'd be capable of it,\" Hocker said.\n\nHocker has long been known for his finishing speed. The runner knew that final card to play. But after such a fast race, it seemed improbable he would still be able to produce it.\n\nThe race result had shocked seemingly everyone -- well, everyone except Hocker.\n\n\"Winning gold was my goal this entire year,\" he said. \"I wrote that down, and I repeated it to myself even if I didn't believe it. My performances showed me that I was capable of running 3:27, whatever it took. I knew I was a medal contender, and I knew that if I get it right, it would be a gold medal. I've been saying that.\"\n\nAnd so, it was Ingebrigtsen and Kerr who were wrong.\n\nThe Norwegian was the fighter left lying on the canvas, finishing fourth without a medal.\n\n\"My team always say that 'because you have a big mouth and is the one to beat, you have everything to lose in competitions,'\" Ingebrigtsen said on Instagram. \"Today, Cole Hocker, Yared Nuguse and Josh Kerr outsmarted me.\"\n\nKerr held on for silver, although he barely finished ahead of bronze medalist Nuguse of Team USA.\n\nMeanwhile, Hocker took gold. The fighter who saw the opportunity arise and delivered the knockout blow.\n\n\"Speaking personally, it can be nice to fly under the radar,\" Hocker said. \"I feel like I took advantage of it.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikael_Ingebrigtsen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mikael Ingebrigtsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sam Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Kerr_(runner)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Kerr (runner)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Ingebrigtsen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jakob Ingebrigtsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Hocker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cole Hocker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yared_Nuguse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yared Nuguse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_records_in_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National records in athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company_Loyalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company Loyalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0806%2Fr1369515_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790216", "eventUri": "eng-9790216", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 460688972, "relevance": 2}

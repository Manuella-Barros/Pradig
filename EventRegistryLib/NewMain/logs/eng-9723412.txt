Biden has vowed to stay in the race, telling ABC News' George Stephanopoulos in an interview released last week that he will drop out only if God Almighty tells him to.\n\nThe Hill and Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ) updated their 2024 presidential forecast and predictions this week to show Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, gaining ground in battleground states with a 58 percent chance of winning the presidency.\n\n\"The former President is now slightly favored over Biden in Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. In contrast, Biden maintains a slight edge in Michigan, Minnesota, and Maine,\" the update said about the eight states.\n\nAccording to The Hill/DDHQ forecast map, Trump leads Biden 51 percent to 49 percent in Nevada, 61 to 39 in Arizona, 63 to 38 in Georgia, 59 to 41 in Pennsylvania, and 59 to 41 in Wisconsin. Biden leads Trump 53 percent to 47 percent in Michigan, 67 to 33 in Minnesota, and 66 to 34 in Maine.\n\nTrump has now tied his best odds of winning the election since the forecast launched last May, according to the update.\n\nTrump is currently predicted to win 235 electoral votes while Biden will get 226, according to the forecast map. Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan still remain toss-ups, while Minnesota and Maine lean Democratic. The forecast update said that Trump can get to 270 electoral votes, enough to win the election, if he wins any four of the eight states mentioned above, but there are other ways.\n\n\"His most efficient path remains Pennsylvania and Georgia, which would net him exactly 270 electoral votes without needing to flip any other states,\" the update read.\n\nWhile Biden won all eight states in 2020, he led in the toss-up states by slim margins. He won Nevada by 2.4 percentage points, Arizona by 0.3, Georgia by 0.2, Pennsylvania by 1.2, Wisconsin by 0.7 and Michigan by 2.8.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Biden and Trump's campaigns via email on Wednesday.\n\nBiden-Harris 2024 Battleground States Director Dan Kanninen said in a statement given to Newsweek by the Biden campaign on Sunday: \"While Trump has little to no presence in the battlegrounds and spends time holding events in New York City, our campaign has more than 200 offices and 1,000 staffers across the states that make up our path to 270 electoral votes.\"\n\nIn a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll conducted from July 1 to 5, Trump led Biden by 2 percentage points (47 percent to 45 percent) among the seven swing states polled -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In those states, 4,902 registered voters were polled and there was a margin of error of plus or minus 1 percentage point.\n\nWhen looking at each state individually, Biden was ahead of Trump in Michigan by 5 percentage points (48-43) and Wisconsin by 3 points (47-44). Trump led Biden in Georgia by 1 percentage point (47-46), Nevada by 3 points (48-45), Pennsylvania by 7 points (51-44), Arizona by 3 points (48-45) and North Carolina by 3 points (46-43).\n\nThere were 694 registered voters polled in Michigan, 695 in Wisconsin, 790 in Georgia, 452 in Nevada, 794 in Pennsylvania, 781 in Arizona and 696 in North Carolina. The margin of error for Georgia and Pennsylvania was plus or minus 3 percentage points; Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin was plus or minus 4 percentage points; and Nevada was plus or

In fact, Donald Trump leads in 11 out of 12 polls conducted in the aftermath of the debate. And the 12th poll is a tie.\n\nThree media polls - the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and CNN - all showed Trump beating Biden by six points. At this point in the 2020 campaign, Biden had a 9-point lead over Trump.\n\nIn addition, new Emerson College poll tested Trump against various potential Biden replacements. Trump beats them all.\n\nThis was a national poll of people all over the country. But we don't elect presidents based on the popular vote. What really matters are the seven battleground states - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin - that will determine the outcome in the Electoral College.\n\nClick Like if you are pro-life to like the LifeNews Facebook page!\n\nPolling shows Donald Trump is currently leading in all seven decisive battleground states.\n\nAnd speaking of \"battleground states,\" New York may be emerging as another potential battleground.

Here are the five biggest takeaways.\n\nTrump's small advantage has expanded\n\nThe bottom line is that Trump is now more likely to win November's election.\n\nThe difference is not monumental, perhaps because the nation as a whole is so polarized that massive sea-changes in opinion are highly rare. But the shift is meaningful, especially in a race that everyone expected to be tight.\n\nIn the national polling average maintained by The Hill and Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ), Trump held an extremely slender lead of 0.4 percentage points on the eve of the debate. He is now up by 1.3 points.\n\nSimilar patterns are seen in other polling averages. In the RealClearPolitics (RCP) average, for instance, Trump's advantage has more than doubled, from 1.5 percentage points on June 27 to 3.3 points now.\n\nThese are modest advantages, to be sure.\n\nBut it is worth remembering two factors that increase Democratic gloom and Republican glee.\n\nFirst, polling during both of Trump's past presidential runs has tended to undercount his support. Second, the vagaries of the Electoral College mean Biden likely needs to win the popular vote convincingly. In 2020, he defeated Trump by more than 4 points in the popular vote, but won the key states in the Electoral College by extremely narrow margins.\n\nThe battleground trend is more mixed -- but, again, Trump has advantage\n\nThe election will, in the end, be decided by about a half-dozen states.\n\nHere, there is some solace for Biden loyalists, at least in terms of the trajectory since the debate. But Trump plainly has the advantage overall.\n\nThe most fiercely fought battlegrounds are likely to be Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nSurprisingly, the polls have moved in Biden's favor -- very slightly -- in three of the six since the debate, according to the DDHQ average. But Trump leads overall in five of the six states.\n\nTrump's edge has narrowed in Arizona and Georgia, and Biden now has a tiny lead of less than half a percentage point in Michigan.\n\nHowever, Trump has roughly doubled his leads in both Nevada and Pennsylvania. The latter is the biggest battleground state.\n\nMeanwhile, polling has shown three states that had been previously seen as a stretch for Trump could now be in play -- New Hampshire, Minnesota and Virginia.\n\nThe nonpartisan Cook Political Report moved six states toward Trump in new ratings released Tuesday. The shift included reclassifying Minnesota and New Hampshire as \"lean Democrat\" rather than \"likely Democrat.\"\n\nDoubts about Biden run deep\n\nEven before the debate, we knew the 2024 election was between two candidates whom huge swathes of the public dislike.\n\nThe post-debate polling, focusing on reactions to Biden's meandering performance, demonstrates how deep those doubts run.\n\nAn Economist/YouGov poll released on Wednesday showed a majority of all Americans, 56 percent, believing Biden should either \"definitely\" or \"probably\" stand aside as the Democratic nominee. Even more striking, 42 percent of Democrats hold this view.\n\nThe same poll found 61 percent of Americans believing that Biden's health and age would \"severely limit\" his ability to do his job if elected to a second term.\n\nA CNN/SSRS poll soon after the debate found 75 percent of voters believing that Democrats would stand a better chance with another nominee.\n\nOn July 3, a Wall Street Journal poll found 80 percent of voters think Biden is too old to run.\n\nIt's theoretically possible to overcome those numbers, especially given Trump's political history encompasses his words and actions around Jan. 6, 2021, and his more recent felony convictions in New York.\n\nStill, concerns on the age question make Biden's climb extremely steep.\n\nHistoric parallels give Democrats more pause\n\nSome Democrats are reaching for the fire alarm on Biden, in part because they note how badly he is doing by comparison with recent presidential elections.\n\nSen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) made this point during an interview with CNN's Kaitlan Collins on Tuesday, when Bennet said he no longer believes Biden will win.\n\nTrump's 3-point edge in the current RCP national average, for example, is all the more powerful because the former president never led that average during the 2020 cycle.\n\nThis time four years ago, Biden led Trump by 9 points.\n\nBack in 2016, Trump led Hillary Clinton only very briefly.\n\nAt this point in the 2016 cycle, Clinton was up by 4.5 points in the RCP average. In the end, Clinton bested Trump by 2.1 points in the popular vote -- and, of course, lost the election.\n\nGoing back to 2012, then-President Obama generally held the lead over GOP nominee Mitt Romney, with the exception of a late blip after a faltering debate performance of his own.\n\nSet against those comparisons. Biden's position looks especially shaky.\n\n2 big polls may be skewing perception about the scale of Trump's lead\n\nThe Biden team's argument, ever since the Atlanta debate, has been that the fundamentals of the race have not shifted.\n\nThat's not really true, as seen above. But Biden hasn't undergone a complete collapse either.\n\nIn fact, the president may have suffered, perception-wise, because two of his worst polls came from major organizations that can set the news agenda: the New York Times and CNN.\n\nA couple of polls soon after the debate, commissioned by those organizations, each gave Trump a 6-point lead.\n\nThey overshadowed surveys from other reputable pollsters that showed a much tighter contest.\n\nA YouGov/CBS News poll showed Trump up by just 2 points and an Ipsos/Reuters poll showed the race tied.\n\nTo be sure, the overall picture is extremely ominous for Democrats.\n\nBut it's not yet definitive that Trump is running away with the race.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri":

In the 2016 campaign and across four years in the White House, Trump proved himself incapable of message discipline, venting against fellow Republicans on social media and turned press conferences into rambling denunciations of the latest character to displease him. This behaviour regularly handed Democrats and journalists the chance to shift the news cycle from issues difficult for them (e.g. immigration) and onto issues difficult for the GOP (e.g. Trump's intemperance and Republican infighting). Few presidents have so routinely undermined their own momentum.\n\nTrump's new-found reticence comes at the perfect time for his candidacy. It is so out-of-character that it is a toss-up as to whether he has hired better advisers or his usual advisers just managed to change the passcode on his iPhone. Truth Social tirades have been kept to a minimum. Trump is behaving almost like a professional politician.\n\nThis has Democrats almost as worried as Biden's mental capacity. Their entire re-election campaign is built around the orange boogeyman, whose outbursts motivate Democrats and repel swing voters. Having manoeuvred him into the GOP nomination with a spot of Maga-baiting lawfare, the Democrats are learning that having Trump as the Republican candidate is only useful to them if he is front and centre, being his bombastic, suburbs-alienating self. With Trump giving the news media the silent treatment, reporters have been left with no option but to cover the president and that isn't going well for him or them.\n\nPanic set in with Biden's catastrophic debate performance, with Democrats at odds over whether to nominate another candidate and the media scrambling to reconcile irrefutable evidence of the president's mental decline with their previous characterisation of any Republican claims to this effect as misinformation and ugly politics. But the Biden campaign's problems didn't begin with the debate. There were reasons to worry long before then, but both the party and its journalistic outriders resolutely ignored them.\n\nThe polling has been trending against Biden for some time now. Of the 26 national polls conducted in the last 30 days, 17 put Trump ahead, five put Biden in the lead, and four had the race tied. Trump's average lead is 3.3 points - or 4.9 when respondents are also given the option of third-party candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Cornel West, and Jill Stein. But while national polls give a flavour of the general public mood, presidential elections are won and lost in battleground states, and it is there that polls are beginning to alarm Democrats.\n\nWisconsin, which has ten electoral college votes, went Trump in 2016 by a margin of 0.77 points and Biden in 2020 by 0.63. There have been 15 polls conducted in the state in the last three months, ten of which gave the advantage to Trump, two to Biden and three resulted in a tie. Michigan, with 15 electoral votes, narrowly backed Trump in 2016 then reverted to blue four years later. However, the state has a sizeable Muslim population, some of whom are said to be unhappy at Biden's failure to be more stridently anti-Israel. Two-thirds of polls in the last three months have favoured Trump. Pennsylvania was the backbone of Hillary Clinton's supposed 'blue wall' in 2016 but it fell to Trump before returning to the Democrat column last time. The state's 19 electorate votes are up for grabs and Biden hasn't led in a single statewide poll since late March.\n\nThe last time Nevada voted for a Republican presidential candidate was George W. Bush in 2004 but its six votes look set to go to Trump. President Biden hasn't managed a poll lead in the Silver State since last October. Since 1952, Arizona has endorsed a Democrat for president only twice but in recent years it has been described as a purple state transitioning from red to blue, thanks in part to immigration. But it's been a year since Biden was out front in a poll there, suggesting the state's 11 electoral votes are Trump's for the taking. Traditionally a red state, Georgia (16 votes) helped Biden get over the line in 2020 but Trump has been in the lead there since last December. Since 1968, only two Democrat presidential candidates have won North Carolina: Jimmy Carter, in 1976 but not 1980, and Barack Obama, in 2008 but not 2012. In the last four elections, the Tar Heel State has been won by a margin of less than five per cent, but Trump has been in the lead there for 22 polls in a row.\n\nThe freakout isn't limited to battleground states. Politico reports that - I can't believe I'm about to write these words - Democrats are worried about New York. Yes, that New York. The New York that, politically speaking, is bluer than Sonic, Cookie Monster and the entire Smurf clan combined. A state that last voted for a Republican for president in 1984 and where Biden won in 2020 by a margin of 23 points. In the latest poll, Trump has cut the president's lead to just eight points in the Empire State. The notion of Trump taking New York's 28 electoral votes is still highly implausible at this point but the 45th president enjoys a narrow lead in a couple of key congressional districts, which might hamper Democrats' ambitions of reclaiming the House.\n\nThe current stalemate between Jill Biden and those Democrats who want a fresh nominee will do little to improve these numbers, but it's not clear that a change will either. For one, Democrats will have to explain why they consider Biden too far gone to be their nominee but are happy for him to continue as commander-in-chief until next January. For another, they will have to come up with an answer as to why they aren't putting Kamala Harris top of the ticket. (An answer, that is, other than 'We don't want to lose all 50 states plus the District'.) And replacing the nominee at the convention next month in Chicago could be a bloody affair, with competing egos knifing one another for the top spot.

Martin O'Malley's 2016 presidential campaign in the state.\n\nDemocrats' concerns about Biden's ability to win are expanding beyond this cycle's predetermined battlegrounds into states that long ago turned blue in presidential elections. In Minnesota, Rep. Angie Craig called on Biden to step aside for a \"new generation of leaders.\" The governors of Maine and New Mexico told the president in a private meeting at the White House last week they were concerned over whether he could still win their states. Another top Maine Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden -- who is running for reelection in a district that Donald Trump won by 6 percentage points in 2020 -- went so far as to say he expects voters will return the former president to the White House. Even Democrats in deep-blue New York see Biden slipping.\n\nBut perhaps nowhere are these bluer-state blues on such stark display as in New Hampshire, which Trump came within half a percentage point of winning in 2016 -- and where a post-debate poll now shows him erasing the double-digit lead Biden held heading into 2024.\n\nMembers of the state's all-Democratic congressional delegation have expressed disappointment in Biden's performance and concerns about how he moves forward from it. And on Tuesday, when the Cook Political Report shifted Electoral College ratings in six swing states toward Republicans, New Hampshire became one of two, along with Minnesota, reclassified as \"lean\" rather than \"likely\" Democratic in the presidential race.\n\nNew Hampshire presents a unique set of circumstances for Biden. The Democrat has long had a complicated political relationship with the state, which culminated this cycle in his move to strip New Hampshire from its prized perch atop the party's presidential primary calendar -- a snub that continues to reverberate even though Biden easily won a write-in campaign waged on his behalf. Unlike other swing states that trend blue in presidential elections, Republicans fully control the state's government.\n\nAnd now Biden's polling lead is evaporating here. A post-debate St. Anselm poll showed Trump up 2 percentage points over the president -- within the margin of error, but a stark reversal from Biden's 10-point lead in the college's last survey in December.\n\nNeil Levesque, the director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, which houses the survey center, said the poll should serve as a warning for Biden.\n\n\"We've all been watching the six or seven key battleground states, and they've now pretty much gone for Trump,\" Levesque said. \"Now if we're into the second tier, in which New Hampshire definitely lies, that's a very alarming situation for the White House.\"\n\nBiden's allies in New Hampshire disputed that his debate-stage face-plant -- and the resurgence of concerns about his age and abilities that has come from it -- could put the state he won by more than 7 percentage points in 2020 back in play. They cited his campaign's infrastructure in the state -- 14 field offices versus one for Trump, a bevy of staffers and a steady stream of surrogates -- as signs of strength. They pointed to how Biden won nearly 64 percent of the Democratic primary vote as a write-in candidate. And they dismissed the St. Anselm poll as an outlier.\n\n\"New Hampshire is going to be OK,\" said Jim Demers, a longtime Democratic strategist in the state who is backing Biden and helped lead the write-in campaign. \"I expect the polls are going to bounce around no matter what. But we have such a large voting bloc of undeclared, independent voters, and that crowd tends not to be supporters of Donald Trump.\"\n\nTrump has a poor track record in bluer swing states. He lost New Hampshire, Minnesota, Virginia and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020. And while he picked up one electoral vote in Maine in each of the last two elections by winning the state's 2nd Congressional District, he lost the state's vote overall.\n\nBut Republicans are emboldened after Biden's calamitous debate performance. Michael Whatley, the chair of the Republican National Committee, said days after the debate that Republicans had \"started to engage\" in New Hampshire, Minnesota and Virginia. Trump's campaign is also opening field offices in Minnesota and Virginia, though those plans were already in motion before the debate, according to an internal memo reviewed by POLITICO.\n\n\"President Trump had a dominant debate performance. ... Joe Biden, on the other hand, is weak, failed, and dishonest, and Democrats are dumpster fire. This stark contrast is why President Trump [is] dominating in every battleground state, and longtime blue states such as Minnesota, Virginia, New Hampshire, and New Jersey are now in play,\" said Trump campaign spokesperson Danielle Alvarez.\n\nIf Trump continues to act as he did in the debate -- \"being civil and staying on message\" -- and Biden \"continues to perform as he performed in that debate and other public settings, yeah, Minnesota will be in play,\" said Mike Erlandson, a former chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.\n\nBiden's campaign has spent months building up infrastructure across safer blue swing states to prevent Republicans from putting them back in play, with more than a dozen field offices in both New Hampshire and Minnesota and 11 in Virginia.\n\n\"While Trump has little to no presence in the battlegrounds and spends time holding events in New York City, our campaign has more than 200 offices and 1,000 staffers across the states that make up our path to 270 electoral votes. Now Trump's campaign is trying to shift their attention to states that supported Joe Biden over him by up to double digits in 2020,\" said Biden campaign battleground states director Dan Kanninen. \"We're keeping our eye on the ball, doing the work everywhere and taking no voter for granted in our campaign to win.\"\n\nBut Biden is no longer simply competing against Trump. He is being forced to wage war against widespread anxiety about his age and electoral chances -- concerns he was able to quash when they were raised by Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and others during the primary process but that are now running rampant.\n\nPhillips said Tuesday that \"his case is the same\" as it was months ago. \"Clearly,\" he told reporters at the Capitol, \"there's been a shift in others.\"\n\nDemocratic Party chairs across blue-leaning states have roundly dismissed the notion that Biden's struggles could put their states back on the battleground map and pledged to keep supporting him as the nominee.\n\nYet the Biden campaign has been forced to work to shore up support outside of the party apparatus. In New Hampshire, that meant leaning on star power -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a staunch supporter of the president whose name often comes up alongside other surrogates as potential replacements on the Democratic ticket -- to attempt to quell Democratic angst in the state about Biden's performance.\n\nIn front of the press at a highway service plaza and behind closed doors at private fundraisers for Democrats running for New Hampshire's state Legislature, Newsom delivered impassioned defenses of the president and was steadfast that Biden would be the nominee.\n\nNewsom brushed aside a reporter's question about whether he'd put his own name forward at a hypothetical brokered convention as \"exactly the question Donald Trump is hoping everyone asks as he's out on the golf course.\" And he cast the growing number of Democrats calling on Biden to step aside as a distraction.\n\nBut outside of the friendly confines of the closed-door fundraiser, Democratic activists in New Hampshire are looking at November with a sense of dread they haven't felt in years.\n\nSteve Shurtleff, a former New Hampshire House speaker who was once one of Biden's biggest backers in the state but supported Phillips in this year's primary, said he hopes the president will cede the nomination to preserve both his legacy and Democrats' electoral prospects.\n\nShurtleff said he's been \"hearing from a lot of Democrats saying they do wish the president would step down\" as the party's nominee. And he, like other activists, faulted Biden for passing on an opportunity to prove his mettle earlier this cycle by skipping the state's primary.\n\n\"New Hampshire is a purple state. In national elections, we tend to vote Democratic. And of course the four members of our congressional delegation are all Democrats. But down the ballot it's much more mixed,\" Shurtleff said in an interview. \"And I think now, looking at the Saint Anselm poll, which is usually a good poll, it's possible this state could go red.\"\n\nDemocratic activist Kimberly Kirkland was even more despairing. She described feeling \"angry\" at Biden for \"defying the public will\" and said it was \"demoralizing\" that he was staying in the race. And, pointing to how Republicans control the governor's seat and the Legislature, she warned that Trump could \"absolutely\" win New Hampshire.\n\n\"If Biden stays on the ticket, we're going to lose turnout,\" she said. \"There are people who would come out for [Gov.] Gretchen Whitmer or Gavin Newsom or [Secretary] Pete Buttigieg or [Vice President] Kamala Harris who will just not come out because they're just going to be so pissed that Biden hung onto this.\"", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Yet little talk has been allocated to where the Electoral College numbers currently sit. While some states are almost certain to follow historical trends (think New York for Democrats and Wyoming for Republicans), the real contest rests in the toss-ups.\n\nDifferent organizations follow their own individual criteria for what makes a \"toss-up\" state. RealClearPolitics (RCP) currently lists 198 safe bets for President Joe Biden out of the available 538 and 219 for Donald Trump. This leaves 121 Electoral College votes in the toss-up range from 11 states*. The number to aim for is the all-important 270.\n\nPoll company FiveThirtyEight calculates that things are a little tighter, with Biden on 226 and Trump on 262 - leaving just four states as toss-ups: Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. A total of 50 EC votes up for grabs.\n\nWhile every outlet uses different models to determine the results, each partakes of the same polling feast to gather its ingredients. So, what happens if we examine the wider toss-up group (RCP's) and filter for only states that have either candidate polling outside the margin of error?\n\nBiden has not beaten Trump in an Arizona poll since April 2023. In 2020, Biden took the Grand Canyon State by less than 10,000 votes out of more than 3.2 million ballots cast, breaking a GOP run that had been in place since 2000.\n\nGeorgia - 16 EC Votes: Trump +4%\n\nYou have to go back to November 2023 to find a poll that favored Biden in Georgia. Like Arizona, the Peach State has a recent history of choosing Republicans for president, until 2020, when it went for Biden by less than 12,000 votes out of a total of almost five million. Trump took Georgia in 2016 by a clear five points against Hillary Clinton.\n\nNevada - 6 EC Votes: Trump +5.2%\n\nThe Silver State has been reliably blue since Barack Obama's 12-point blowout in 2008. Trump lost here in 2016 to Clinton by roughly two-and-a-half points and in 2020 to Biden by approximately the same margin. But the polling heavily favors The Donald this time around. The last time Biden came top in a poll was the week of the Hamas attack in Israel.\n\nNorth Carolina - 16 EC Votes: Trump +5.8%\n\nAside from a brief flirtation with Obama in 2008 (who beat John McCain by just 14,000 votes), North Carolina has been reliably red since Ronald Reagan beat Jimmy Carter in 1980. In both 2016 and 2020, Trump won the state, a feat that - if the polling is any indication - he is likely to repeat in 2024. One has to venture back to October 2023 to find a survey that favors the incumbent president.\n\nPennsylvania - 19 EC Votes: Trump +5.3%\n\nWith its precious 19 EC votes, the Keystone State is on everyone's radar. Biden has practically camped out here in the hopes that the voters will do for him once more what they did in 2020 - put him over the top (notably, as they also did for Trump in 2016). With Pennsylvania in the president's back pocket, he has more pathways to the crucial 270 EC votes. But the current polling suggests that this might be a heavy lift.\n\nWhen adding the above EC votes to Trump's \"safe seat\" total, he comes in at 287, more than enough to win the required 270 - even if he were to lose Arizona, North Carolina, Nevada, or Georgia.\n\nThe observant reader will notice that, of the toss-up races with a candidate outside of the margin of error, Biden does not appear in a single one. Astutely noted! While Biden currently holds a lead in Minnesota (3%), New Hampshire (3%), and Virginia (2.2%), they are all within the margin of error; the same goes for Trump in Michigan (0.6%) and Wisconsin (2.2%).\n\nShould these polls be proven accurate, Biden would need to win Minnesota, New Hampshire, Virginia, Michigan, Wisconsin, and one EC vote extra, such as from Nebraska's Second District. This would give him a total of 251 - meaning he needs to overturn a 5.3% advantage and capture Pennsylvania from Trump to cross the finish line. It's a much harder road for the incumbent than for the challenger.\n\nA lot can change in the 100-plus days of campaigning that remain. But two notable events have come to pass that could determine the ultimate course. First, Trump seems highly unlikely to be convicted of any more felonies before the election. He also will likely not be sentenced to prison any time soon for the 34 he has already been found guilty of in light of the sure-to-come appeals in the wake of the Supreme Court's recent presidential immunity ruling.\n\nSecond, Biden appears unable to dig himself out of the cognitive ability ditch in which he found himself after the disastrous debate. Support within his own party is wavering, with a number of congressional Democrats openly asking for a new candidate. Add to that the Fourth Estate's calls for his replacement, and it suggests that Biden's prospects have only one trajectory.", "source": {"uri": "libertynation.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

American institutions are not the infrastructure of democracy, according to Trump, but black boxes through which the people who actually run the country exercise their power, indifferent and unaccountable to the will of the people. These accusations are disingenuous and self-serving, not to mention more aptly leveled at the party Trump leads, which is currently exercised primarily through the six unelected partisans he has placed on the Supreme Court. But Trump, aided by a GOP that coalesced around him, has conditioned a significant portion of the American electorate to excuse and more often applaud this political nihilism: \"In a world where everything is bullshit and everyone only thinks about themselves, after all, you might as well focus on winning to the point of getting tired of winning, as Trump memorably said in 2016.\"\n\nBiden ran in 2020 not just against Trump, but against the disillusionment that he and his movement feed on. The country was emerging from a term of endless chaos and corruption, and was still grappling with a pandemic that had laid bare the limits of Trump's zero-sum politics. In what he described as a winter of peril and possibility, Biden vowed in his inaugural address to restore the soul and secure the future of America by marshaling the power and wisdom of the institutions Trump sought to destroy. America must do better than this, he declared upon taking office. This is a time to be bold, because there is so much to do.\n\nBiden has delivered on many of the promises he made in that speech. But he has failed to exorcise the MAGA movement from our politics, and now it threatens to come back even stronger: The right has drawn up its Project 2025 wish list, and Trump, who holds a commanding lead in the polls, appears ready to make this Christian nationalist nightmare, as well as his own fantasies of personal retribution, a reality. Worse, where Biden once seized the moment, he now seems to be turning away from it: he dismisses unfavorable polls and media coverage as false or biased; he distorts legitimate skepticism about his candidacy as a stab in the back of the elite; and he replaces that boldness of vision with something closer to \"save your breath and get on board,\" as David Axelrod summed it up the other day. It's me or Trump.\n\nThe choice is obvious, even after last month's debate raised serious questions about Biden's age and insight: His reelection would at least keep democracy on life support, while Trump's would mean a return to chaos and beyond. Yet it's one thing to ask people to hold their noses when they vote; it's quite another to ask them to cover their eyes and ears -- and that's what Biden and his allies are doing now, to the nation's peril in November and beyond.\n\nNone of this suggests an equivalence between Biden and Trump or the parties they lead. Trump poses a grave danger to the country, and defeating him is, as Biden said in a letter Monday, the only task before them in November. But that effort is seriously undermined by the votive-candle politics that have taken hold in some corners of the Democratic Party, which at times seems to argue not only that Biden remains the candidate most likely to defeat Trump, but that there is nothing to fear at all, except that elites are persecuting him over a single bad debate.\n\nOf course, the elites have been late to this: For months, voters have been saying in polls that they consider Biden too old to run again and would prefer that he step aside. Yes, Democrats overwhelmingly put Biden on primary ballots this year, as he and his representatives have been quick to point out. But there has been no serious primary to speak of, and no real stress test of his candidacy to expose the weaknesses exposed in the debate with Trump. After that disappointing performance, a CNN poll found that three-quarters of voters thought Democrats would have a better chance of winning with someone other than Biden at the top of the ticket -- and they are probably right, if subsequent polls are any indication. He is trailing his predecessor in national polls, and he is struggling more in the battleground states he needs to hold on to the presidency. In Wisconsin, for example, Biden is trailing by five points in a new poll, even though Sen. Tammy Baldwin, the incumbent Democrat in the state, enjoys a commanding lead over her Republican opponent in the poll.\n\nPeople seem to want to vote for Democrats, whose policies on abortion and a number of other issues are broadly popular with the public. They just seem less enthusiastic about voting for Biden, so much so that Vice President Kamala Harris and even Hillary Clinton, whose failed and overconfident 2016 campaign gave us Trump in the first place, are both polling better than the current party leader and his opponent.\n\nThe idea that the presidential race is a dead heat was already overblown before the debate, as election analyst Dave Wasserman noted Tuesday. Today, Trump has a clear lead over Biden and a much more plausible path to 270 electoral votes. On Tuesday, Cook Political Report upgraded its ratings in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia and Nevada, all of which Biden won in 2020, from \"decisive\" to \"leaning Republican,\" and considered more Democratic territory like New Hampshire and Minnesota to be in play for Trump.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri":

As of July 8, 2024, Trump is leading in all of them as his popularity has only soared since he was convicted of a felony in a New York courtroom on May 31.\n\nCheck out the Economist predictive charts and graphs at this link.\n\nThe Economist's model of America's presidential election estimates each major candidate's chances of winning each state and the overall electoral college.\n\nThe model was developed with scholars at Columbia University, and combines national and state-level polls with fundamental data about the state of the economy, historical voting patterns, and the demographics of each state to predict the likelihood of various outcomes of the race.\n\nThe model constructs thousands of scenarios, each one containing different variables that account for things like polling bias and other characteristics.\n\nFor more details on exactly how the model works, read the full methodology.", "source": {"uri": "mustreadalaska.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Must Read Alaska"}, "authors": [{"uri": "suzanne_downing@mustreadalaska.com", "name": "Suzanne Downing", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://mustreadalaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Trump-t-shirt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723412", "eventUri": "eng-9723412", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 849, "textEnd": 855}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

He had another slight uptick in the week following, before slowly dropping down this week. Biden still remains ahead of Trump in the search bar.\n\nInterest in Trump's name has continued to decline since the week of June 23-29 while searches for Biden's name continue to be twice as popular.\n\nThe presidential debate, which marked a turning point for Biden's campaign, was held on June 27, and Biden's troubling performance has sent the Democratic Party into a tailspin as calls for him to step aside continue to grow louder and from more prominent Democrats.\n\nTrump and Biden had previously been neck-and-neck on Google Search, with Trump holding a slight lead for the most part. Searches for Biden's name saw a slight surge the week of September 10-16, 2023, but it appeared to be a blip since searches for Trump's name overtook him again the week after.\n\nTrump himself has seen two major jumps in search interest over the last 12 months. Searches for his name soared between August 20 to 26, 2023 and May 26 to June 1, 2023. Trump's lead on Google Trends was more than fourfold in August and over fivefold in May.\n\nThe nation saw it's first mug shot of a former president on August 24, when Trump surrendered to authorities at the Fulton County Jail in Atlanta, Georgia. Shortly after, Trump himself posted the booking photo onto his reinstated X, formerly Twitter account, marking his first tweet since he was suspended from the platform in January 2021.\n\nTrump became the first former president to be convicted on May 30 after a Manhattan jury found him guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in his criminal hush money case. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and is appealing the verdict.\n\nSearches for \"Joe Biden\" are higher in D.C., Delaware, Nebraska, Ohio and Maryland while more people are googling \"Donald Trump\" in New Mexico, Iowa, Missouri, South Carolina and West Virginia.\n\nThere has also been a rise in related Biden searches for Representative Dean Phillips, who unsuccessfully challenged Biden for the Democratic nomination earlier this year, \"impeachment inquiry,\" \"medical emergency,\" \"write-in\" and \"birthday cake.\" Those searching Trump are also looking up Phillips, as well as \"mug shot,\" \"dtj stock,\" \"dtj stock price\" and \"New Hampshire primary.\"\n\nBiden's surge on Google Trends underscores the drama surrounding his candidacy, and suggests that Americans are paying attention to the internal panic within the Democratic Party. Biden's campaign has sought to calm fears in the aftermath of the debate, scheduling an extended interview with ABC News for the public while issuing all-staff memos addressing the state of the race.\n\nThe president also wrote a letter to Democratic members of Congress on Monday, insisting that he's staying in the race, but whether that has quelled any concerns is unclear.\n\nTwo days later, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sidestepped a question asking her if Biden should run for reelection, instead stressing that \"time is running short\" for Biden to make a decision, even after the president insisted he would continue to run. Later on Wednesday, Senator Peter Welch became the first Senate Democrat to call on Biden to withdraw from the race.\n\nAs the president continues to stare down his party, Biden remains at the forefront of U.S. politics and news, which could be good news for Trump, since it could shift negative attention away from the former president. Republican strategist Matt Klink had previously told Newsweek that if the Democrats replaced Biden as their nominee, \"it would completely flip the script for the 2024 presidential election.\"\n\n\"Instead of a comparison between the two candidates both with significant negatives, it would create more of a 2020-like climate where Donald Trump becomes the issue,\" Klink said.\n\nAlthough more people are googling Biden, Trump has the upper hand in the polls. RealClearPolling averages show Trump ahead of Biden by 3 percentage points while FiveThirtyEight has Trump with a 2-point lead. Two recently-released polls from the New York Times/Siena College and the Wall Street Journal found Trump with a larger 6-point advantage.\n\nAt this time during the last presidential election, Biden had been leading Trump by 9 points on July 11, 2020, according to RealClearPolling.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Maine hasn't gone fully red since 1988. New Mexico has picked the GOP nominee only once in the last eight elections. And in Minnesota, voters haven't done that since 1972.\n\nBut President Joe Biden's disastrous debate -- and his subsequent inability to reassure disquieted Democrats -- suddenly has members of his party warning that they are now at risk of losing all of those states.\n\n\"Our enemies are at the gate, and they are gleeful,\" said Jay Surdukowski, an attorney and Democratic activist from New Hampshire who co-chaired former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley's 2016 presidential campaign in the state.\n\nDemocrats' concerns about Biden's ability to win are expanding beyond this cycle's predetermined battlegrounds into states that long ago turned blue in presidential elections. In Minnesota, Rep. Angie Craig called on Biden to step aside for a \"new generation of leaders.\" The governors of Maine and New Mexico told the president in a private meeting at the White House last week they were concerned over whether he could still win their states. Another top Maine Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden -- who is running for reelection in a district that Donald Trump won by 6 percentage points in 2020 -- went so far as to say he expects voters will return the former president to the White House. Even Democrats in deep-blue New York see Biden slipping.\n\nBut perhaps nowhere are these bluer-state blues on such stark display as in New Hampshire, which Trump came within half a percentage point of winning in 2016 -- and where a post-debate poll now shows him erasing the double-digit lead Biden held heading into 2024.\n\nMembers of the state's all-Democratic congressional delegation have expressed disappointment in Biden's performance and concerns about how he moves forward from it. And on Tuesday, when the Cook Political Report shifted Electoral College ratings in six swing states toward Republicans, New Hampshire became one of two, along with Minnesota, reclassified as \"lean\" rather than \"likely\" Democratic in the presidential race.\n\nNew Hampshire presents a unique set of circumstances for Biden. The Democrat has long had a complicated political relationship with the state, which culminated this cycle in his move to strip New Hampshire from its prized perch atop the party's presidential primary calendar -- a snub that continues to reverberate even though Biden easily won a write-in campaign waged on his behalf. Unlike other swing states that trend blue in presidential elections, Republicans fully control the state's government.\n\nAnd now Biden's polling lead is evaporating here. A post-debate St. Anselm poll showed Trump up 2 percentage points over the president -- within the margin of error, but a stark reversal from Biden's 10-point lead in the college's last survey in December.\n\nNeil Levesque, the director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, which houses the survey center, said the poll should serve as a warning for Biden.\n\n\"We've all been watching the six or seven key battleground states, and they've now pretty much gone for Trump,\" Levesque said. \"Now if we're into the second tier, in which New Hampshire definitely lies, that's a very alarming situation for the White House.\"\n\nBiden's allies in New Hampshire disputed that his debate-stage face-plant -- and the resurgence of concerns about his age and abilities that has come from it -- could put the state he won by more than 7 percentage points in 2020 back in play. They cited his campaign's infrastructure in the state -- 14 field offices versus one for Trump, a bevy of staffers and a steady stream of surrogates -- as signs of strength. They pointed to how Biden won nearly 64 percent of the Democratic primary vote as a write-in candidate. And they dismissed the St. Anselm poll as an outlier.\n\n\"New Hampshire is going to be OK,\" said Jim Demers, a longtime Democratic strategist in the state who is backing Biden and helped lead the write-in campaign. \"I expect the polls are going to bounce around no matter what. But we have such a large voting bloc of undeclared, independent voters, and that crowd tends not to be supporters of Donald Trump.\"\n\nTrump has a poor track record in bluer swing states. He lost New Hampshire, Minnesota, Virginia and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020. And while he picked up one electoral vote in Maine in each of the last two elections by winning the state's 2nd Congressional District, he lost the state's vote overall.\n\nBut Republicans are emboldened after Biden's calamitous debate performance. Michael Whatley, the chair of the Republican National Committee, said days after the debate that Republicans had \"started to engage\" in New Hampshire, Minnesota and Virginia. Trump's campaign is also opening field offices in Minnesota and Virginia, though those plans were already in motion before the debate, according to an internal memo reviewed by POLITICO.\n\n\"President Trump had a dominant debate performance. ... Joe Biden, on the other hand, is weak, failed, and dishonest, and Democrats are dumpster fire. This stark contrast is why President Trump [is] dominating in every battleground state, and longtime blue states such as Minnesota, Virginia, New Hampshire, and New Jersey are now in play,\" said Trump campaign spokesperson Danielle Alvarez.\n\nIf Trump continues to act as he did in the debate -- \"being civil and staying on message\" -- and Biden \"continues to perform as he performed in that debate and other public settings, yeah, Minnesota will be in play,\" said Mike Erlandson, a former chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.\n\nBiden's campaign has spent months building up infrastructure across safer blue swing states to prevent Republicans from putting them back in play, with more than a dozen field offices in both New Hampshire and Minnesota and 11 in Virginia.\n\n\"While Trump has little to no presence in the battlegrounds and spends time holding events in New York City, our campaign has more than 200 offices and 1,000 staffers across the states that make up our path to 270 electoral votes. Now Trump's campaign is trying to shift their attention to states that supported Joe Biden over him by up to double digits in 2020,\" said Biden campaign battleground states director Dan Kanninen. \"We're keeping our eye on the ball, doing the work everywhere and taking no voter for granted in our campaign to win.\"\n\nBut Biden is no longer simply competing against Trump. He is being forced to wage war against widespread anxiety about his age and electoral chances -- concerns he was able to quash when they were raised by Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and others during the primary process but that are now running rampant.\n\nPhillips said Tuesday that \"his case is the same\" as it was months ago. \"Clearly,\" he told reporters at the Capitol, \"there's been a shift in others.\"\n\nDemocratic Party chairs across blue-leaning states have roundly dismissed the notion that Biden's struggles could put their states back on the battleground map and pledged to keep supporting him as the nominee.\n\nYet the Biden campaign has been forced to work to shore up support outside of the party apparatus. In New Hampshire, that meant leaning on star power -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a staunch supporter of the president whose name often comes up alongside other surrogates as potential replacements on the Democratic ticket -- to attempt to quell Democratic angst in the state about Biden's performance.\n\nIn front of the press at a highway service plaza and behind closed doors at private fundraisers for Democrats running for New Hampshire's state Legislature, Newsom delivered impassioned defenses of the president and was steadfast that Biden would be the nominee.\n\nNewsom brushed aside a reporter's question about whether he'd put his own name forward at a hypothetical brokered convention as \"exactly the question Donald Trump is hoping everyone asks as he's out on the golf course.\" And he cast the growing number of Democrats calling on Biden to step aside as a distraction.\n\nBut outside of the friendly confines of the closed-door fundraiser, Democratic activists in New Hampshire are looking at November with a sense of dread they haven't felt in years.\n\nSteve Shurtleff, a former New Hampshire House speaker who was once one of Biden's biggest backers in the state but supported Phillips in this year's primary, said he hopes the president will cede the nomination to preserve both his legacy and Democrats' electoral prospects.\n\nShurtleff said he's been \"hearing from a lot of Democrats saying they do wish the president would step down\" as the party's nominee. And he, like other activists, faulted Biden for passing on an opportunity to prove his mettle earlier this cycle by skipping the state's primary.\n\n\"New Hampshire is a purple state. In national elections, we tend to vote Democratic. And of course the four members of our congressional delegation are all Democrats. But down the ballot it's much more mixed,\" Shurtleff said in an interview. \"And I think now, looking at the Saint Anselm poll, which is usually a good poll, it's possible this state could go red.\"\n\nDemocratic activist Kimberly Kirkland was even more despairing. She described feeling \"angry\" at Biden for \"defying the public will\" and said it was \"demoralizing\" that he was staying in the race. And, pointing to how Republicans control the governor's seat and the Legislature, she warned that Trump could \"absolutely\" win New Hampshire.\n\n\"If Biden stays on the ticket, we're going to lose turnout,\" she said. \"There are people who would come out for [Gov.] Gretchen Whitmer or Gavin Newsom or [Secretary] Pete Buttigieg or [Vice President] Kamala Harris who will just not come out because they're just going to be so pissed that Biden hung onto this.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But after Biden turned up at the first presidential debate looking addled and aged, election oddsmakers tracked a slight tilt Trumpward.\n\nLast week, the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia moved Minnesota out of the \"Likely Democratic\" category and into \"Leans Democratic,\" and moved Michigan from \"Leans Democratic\" to \"Toss-Up.\" On Wednesday, analysts at the Cook Political Report reclassified Minnesota from a likely Democratic win to merely leaning. Post-debate poll data is scant, but America saw what it saw on debate night and Minnesota is one of six states where Cook estimates former President Donald Trump likely picked up an advantage.\n\nLook no farther than Minnesota's swing congressional districts to find Democrats who have crunched those numbers already.\n\nIn the Third District, U.S. Rep. Dean Phillips made an unpopular, career-ending run for president against Biden. In the Second District, U.S. Rep. Angie Craig became the first House Democrat from a toss-up district to call on the president to end his campaign and make way for \"a new generation of leaders.\"\n\n\"The trend that we're seeing nationally is that the Democrats who are Biden skeptics at this moment are disproportionately those who have been avid consumers of polling data in swing districts and are talking to a broad spectrum of voters to win their races -- and have deep concerns about what Biden remaining on the ticket could do to their chances of holding on,\" David Wasserman, senior editor and elections analyst for the Cook Political Report, said in a Thursday conference call with journalists.\n\nCraig -- who weathered two consecutive elections that were almost derailed by third-party challengers, both living and deceased -- would be keenly aware of what can happen if disillusioned Democratic voters drift away, Wasserman said.\n\nBiden carried Minnesota by 52% in 2020, to Trump's 45%. The 2016 presidential race was much closer in Minnesota. Hillary Clinton bested Trump 46.4% to 44.9%.\n\nBut Biden's approval numbers were low before his shambling debate performance in late June.\n\n\"As such, it's hard to justify keeping states that Biden carried by less than eight points, like Minnesota, New Hampshire and Nebraska's 2nd District, in Likely Democrat. They now move to Lean Democrat,\" wrote Cook's editor-in-chief, Amy Walter.\n\nVoters don't seem to be flocking to Trump -- whose own debate performance veered from addled to untruthful in the extreme. But Walter noted that Biden was trailing Trump by 1 point in a RealClearPolitics national poll on June 27. On Wednesday, Trump was ahead by 3 points.\n\n\"Biden was losing pre-debate,\" Walter wrote. \"Now, he's losing by a bit more.\"\n\nIn light of the new polling data, there are now just three states in Cook's toss-up column -- too close to call for either candidate: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Cook has moved Arizona, Georgia and Nevada from Toss-Up to Lean Republican.\n\nWalter noted that Trump is just as unpopular as Biden. Never-Trump voters may be turning away from Biden, but they don't seem to be turning to Trump.\n\nThen again, she said, \"Trump doesn't need to win over disappointed or disillusioned anti-Trump voters; he just needs them to stay home.\"", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

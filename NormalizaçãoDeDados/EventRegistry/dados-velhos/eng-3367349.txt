That's why we're winning.\"\n\nKeon Broxton homered twice and Neil Walker and Travis Shaw also went deep as Milwaukee completed a sweep of the two-game series with its fourth straight win after an extended offensive slump.\n\n\"It's certainly fun when you hit home runs,\" Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.\n\nPina's one-out shot to right field came off Pirates reliever Juan Nicasio (1-5). The 30-year-old rookie glanced into the Brewers' dugout before watching the ball disappear over the outfield wall.\n\n\"The clubhouse, the dugout, we're feeling the energy,\" Pina said. \"We feel like this is the team we used to be in the first half.\"\n\nThe Pirates grabbed an early lead on Josh Bell's run-scoring single. Pittsburgh extended the lead to 4-0 in the third on consecutive two-out singles by Andrew McCutchen, Bell and David Freese.\n\nThe Brewers broke through in the third on Broxton's leadoff home run. After Eric Sogard walked, Walker smacked a homer against his former team to cut Milwaukee's deficit to 4-3.\n\nShaw's leadoff homer in the sixth, the third home run off Pittsburgh starter Gerrit Cole, tied the score.\n\nCole, who entered the game having won his last seven starts on the road, gave up four runs and five hits in six innings. He struck out nine and walked three.\n\n\"They are a dangerous club,\" Cole said. \"It is just frustrating to get spotted that (lead) and not be able to hold it. That's kind of the sour taste in my mouth right now.\"\n\nPittsburgh regained the lead in the seventh on Josh Harrison's RBI single. John Jaso scored from second base, sliding in just ahead of the tag, a call that stood after a brief review.\n\nThe Brewers tied it again in the bottom of the inning when Broxton led off with his second homer of the game, a shot to left off reliever George Kontos.\n\nBell led off the eighth with a triple and scored on Adam Frazier's single off Milwaukee reliever Anthony Swarzak (1-0).\n\nBrewers starter Jimmy Nelson, who allowed a career-high 10 runs in his previous outing, settled down after the shaky third inning, retiring 11 consecutive batters during one stretch. He gave up five runs, three earned, and eight hits in 6 1/3 innings. Nelson struck out seven and walked one.\n\nCorey Knebel earned his 24th save in 29 chances.\n\nADDED MOTIVATION\n\nBroxton started in center field after watching infielder Jonathan Villar get his first-ever start at the position on Tuesday night.\n\n\"I'd be lying if I said it didn't,\" Broxton said when asked if the decision served as motivation. \"It definitely does. I want to be out there playing and helping the team. But if I'm not doing it at that time, I have to be respectful of what Counsell wants.\" Counsell praised Broxton's work ethic. \"He's worked on his game tremendously hard,\" Counsell said. \"But he'll be the first guy cheering you on in the dugout if he's not playing.\"\n\nNOT THIS TIME\n\nCole turned in three dominating performances against the Brewers this season until falling victim to the long ball on Wednesday. Cole pitched seven innings and surrendered just one run in each of his previous outings against Milwaukee. Overall, he was 7-0 in his last seven starts on the road. With the no decision on Wednesday, Cole still hasn't lost since May 22 in Atlanta.\n\n\"They were able to do damage on the swings that they took,\" Cole said. \"It was unfortunate I couldn't hold them down.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nPirates: C Francisco Cervelli remained out of the lineup. He left Sunday's games with left hand and wrist discomfort. Chris Stewart started in his place.\n\nBrewers: SS Orlando Arcia sat out for the second consecutive game with back spasms. ... C Stephen Vogt (left knee sprain) went 2 for 3 while playing first base for Triple-A Colorado Springs in a game at Iowa. Vogt is expected to make one more rehab start before likely rejoining Milwaukee for a weekend series in Colorado. ... OF Ryan Braun got a routine day off. ... Swarzak pitched in relief for the first time since Aug. 10 after being sidelined with a stiff neck.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPirates: Jameson Taillon (7-5) gets the start Thursday as Pittsburgh begins a four-game series at home against St. Louis. Taillon is 0-1 with a 4.91 ERA in three career starts against the Cardinals.\n\nBrewers: Matt Garza (6-6) takes the mound as Milwaukee opens a three-game series at Colorado on Friday. Brandon Woodruff, who had been scheduled to start on Friday, will instead face the Rockies on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

After Eric Sogard walked, Walker smacked a homer against his former team to cut Milwaukee's deficit to 4-3.\n\nShaw's leadoff homer in the sixth, the third home run off Pittsburgh starter Gerrit Cole, tied the score.\n\nCole, who entered the game having won his last seven starts on the road, gave up four runs and five hits in six innings. He struck out nine and walked three.\n\n\"They are a dangerous club,\" Cole said. \"It is just frustrating to get spotted that (lead) and not be able to hold it. That's kind of the sour taste in my mouth right now.\"\n\nPittsburgh regained the lead in the seventh on Josh Harrison's RBI single. John Jaso scored from second base, sliding in just ahead of the tag, a call that stood after a brief review.\n\nThe Brewers tied it again in the bottom of the inning when Broxton led off with his second homer of the game, a shot to left off reliever George Kontos.\n\nBell led off the eighth with a triple and scored on Adam Frazier's single off Milwaukee reliever Anthony Swarzak (1-0).\n\nBrewers starter Jimmy Nelson, who allowed a career-high 10 runs in his previous outing, settled down after the shaky third inning, retiring 11 consecutive batters during one stretch. He gave up five runs, three earned, and eight hits in 6 1/3 innings. Nelson struck out seven and walked one.\n\nCorey Knebel earned his 24th save in 29 chances.\n\nADDED MOTIVATION\n\nBroxton started in center field after watching infielder Jonathan Villar get his first-ever start at the position on Tuesday night.\n\n\"I'd be lying if I said it didn't,\" Broxton said when asked if the decision served as motivation. \"It definitely does. I want to be out there playing and helping the team. But if I'm not doing it at that time, I have to be respectful of what Counsell wants.\" Counsell praised Broxton's work ethic. \"He's worked on his game tremendously hard,\" Counsell said. \"But he'll be the first guy cheering you on in the dugout if he's not playing.\"\n\nNOT THIS TIME\n\nCole turned in three dominating performances against the Brewers this season until falling victim to the long ball on Wednesday. Cole pitched seven innings and surrendered just one run in each of his previous outings against Milwaukee. Overall, he was 7-0 in his last seven starts on the road. With the no decision on Wednesday, Cole still hasn't lost since May 22 in Atlanta.\n\n\"They were able to do damage on the swings that they took,\" Cole said. \"It was unfortunate I couldn't hold them down.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nPirates: C Francisco Cervelli remained out of the lineup. He left Sunday's games with left hand and wrist discomfort. Chris Stewart started in his place.\n\nBrewers: SS Orlando Arcia sat out for the second consecutive game with back spasms. ... C Stephen Vogt (left knee sprain) went 2 for 3 while playing first base for Triple-A Colorado Springs in a game at Iowa. Vogt is expected to make one more rehab start before likely rejoining Milwaukee for a weekend series in Colorado. ... OF Ryan Braun got a routine day off. ... Swarzak pitched in relief for the first time since Aug. 10 after being sidelined with a stiff neck.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPirates: Jameson Taillon (7-5) gets the start Thursday as Pittsburgh begins a four-game series at home against St. Louis. Taillon is 0-1 with a 4.91 ERA in three career starts against the Cardinals.\n\nBrewers: Matt Garza (6-6) takes the mound as Milwaukee opens a three-game series at Colorado on Friday. Brandon Woodruff, who had been scheduled to start on Friday, will instead face the Rockies on Saturday.\n\n--\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball", "date": "2017-08-16",

That started a month-long offensive drought for Milwaukee and its eventual fall from first place in the National League Central.\n\nWith Orlando Arcia a late scratch due to back spasms and Eric Sogard filling in for him at shortstop, the Brewers had an all left-handed-hitting infield and five left-handed hitters in the lineup altogether - Jonathan Villar and Neil Walker are switch-hitters - to face right-hander Ivan Nova.\n\nTravis Shaw, who entered the night a career .769 hitter against Nova (10 for 13 with three homers), singled to open the Brewers' second. Then Domingo Santana walked and Walker reached on an error to load the bases with nobody out, setting Milwaukee up for a potential big inning.\n\nPi\u00f1a's groundout drove in Shaw to make it 1-0, but Sogard followed by grounding into a 4-6-3 double play and the Brewers were forced to settle for just the single run.\n\nDavies, who was coming in off perhaps his worst start of the season, induced five ground-ball outs in the first two innings before working around multiple base-runners in each of the next three.\n\nThe fourth proved to be the most interesting for Davies. With two outs and Josh Bell on first, Adam Frazier dumped a single into right. Rather than playing it safe and at least hitting the cutoff man, Santana rushed in and uncorked a wild throw that got past Shaw at third.\n\nBell tried scoring, but the ball bounced back to Shaw on the rebound and he made a strong throw home to get a sliding Bell at the plate. Manager Clint Hurdle challenged the play, believing Pi\u00f1a blocked the plate, but the out call was confirmed in short order.\n\nThe Brewers couldn't get much of anything going against Nova after the second, and the Pirates finally took advantage in the sixth. With Bell on base again, Frazier laced a two-out triple down the first-base line and Bell came around to score to knot it at 1-1.\n\nMilwaukee quickly responded by manufacturing a run in the bottom of the sixth.\n\nShaw walked with one out, went to second on a passed ball and took third on a groundout by Santana. After Pittsburgh put Walker on via an intentional walk, Pi\u00f1a pulled a grounder into the hole that deflected off third baseman David Freese's glove and to shortstop Jordy Mercer.\n\nMercer made a strong throw to first but Bell's deep stretch pulled his foot just off the base as Pi\u00f1a crossed it, leaving him with an infield single and the Brewers back in front at 2-1.\n\nLike Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Sports on Facebook for the latest Wisconsin sports updates right in your news feed.Visit JS Sports on FacebookLike Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Sports on Facebook for the latest Wisconsin sports updates right in your news feed.Visit on Facebook\n\nDavies and Jared Hughes combined on a scoreless seventh, with Hughes getting Josh Harrison on a comebacker with the potential tying run at second base for the final out.\n\nIn a 101-pitch outing, Davies allowed six hits, one run and two walks with a pair of strikeouts - a nice bounce-back effort for the right-hander, who improved to 14-6 on the season while lowering his ERA to 4.26.\n\nBroxton applied the finishing touch in the seventh. Batting in the pitcher's spot, he led off the bottom half of the frame by homering to right-center off A.J. Schugel to give the Brewers a two-run cushion at 3-1.\n\nJacob Barnes and Corey Knebel combined to pitch a scoreless eighth and ninth, respectively, with Knebel recording his 23rd save.\n\nBEHIND THE BOX SCORE\n\n\" Manager Craig Counsell announced Brandon Woodruff, Matt Garza and Chase Anderson as his three starters for the upcoming weekend series at Colorado.\n\n\"Chase was pitching very, very well before he got hurt,\" Counsell said. \"He's a guy we've missed. Brent (Suter) filled in very nicely for him, but if we can get Chase into that form, that's a big addition, for sure.\"\n\nThe return of Anderson is a boon and somewhat of a surprise, considering it was initially expected he'd need three minor-league rehab starts before returning. Anderson, who's been on the disabled list since June 29 with a strained left oblique, was 6-2 with a 2.89 ERA and WHIP of 1.11 through 16 turns.\n\n\"I'm ready for the rehab experience to be over,\" Anderson said. \"I feel like I'm built back up.\"\n\n\" The Brewers also likely will be welcoming catcher Stephen Vogt back along with Anderson in Colorado. Vogt, who's been out with a left-knee sprain since July 18, is in the midst of a minor-league rehab stint that was transferred earlier Tuesday to Class AAA Colorado Springs.\n\n\"He's on track to join us,\" said Counsell. \"He's got three games left to play. He'll catch two out of three games in Colorado Springs and if he's healthy at that point and feeling good, he'll join us in Colorado.\"\n\nSTAT SHEET\n\n\" Walker, who played for the Pirates from 2009-'15, is hitting .333 with four homers and 10 RBI in 10 career games against his former team.\n\n\" The Brewers have outscored their opponents, 95-54, in the first inning this season - the largest margin in the major leagues. Their 95 first-inning runs also top the majors.\n\nTAKEAWAY\n\nThere wasn't a lot of offense to speak of, but with Davies dealing the Brewers didn't need much. Getting Davies back on track is big as well, considering how poorly he fared his last time out.\n\nRECORD\n\nThis year: 62-59 (34-30 home; 28-29 away)\n\nLast year: 52-69\n\nATTENDANCE\n\nTuesday: 32,605\n\n2017 total: 1,984,676 (31,011 avg.)\n\nLast year: 1,840,225 (28,753 avg.)\n\nNEXT GAME\n\nWednesday: Brewers vs. Pirates, 1:10 p.m. Milwaukee RHP Jimmy Nelson (9-6, 3.72) vs. Pittsburgh RHP Gerrit Cole (10-8, 3.96) TV: FS Wisconsin.

We had a good series against Cincinnati, Zach (Davies) pitched great again (Tuesday night), and we scored enough runs to win.\"\n\nMilwaukee's offense got a boost from the addition of Neil Walker, who has three hits in his first two games since coming over from the New York Mets. He also has been impressive in the field and is likely to see a majority of the action at second base down the stretch.\n\n\"He (has) played really well,\" manager Craig Counsell said. \"He knows what he's doing.\"\n\nJimmy Nelson (9-6, 3.72 ERA) gets the ball for Milwaukee, looking to bounce back after a rough outing last week against the Cincinnati Reds when he was tagged for 10 runs (nine earned) on 11 hits and three walks in 3 2/3 innings.\n\n\"When it rains, it pours,\" Nelson said after that outing. \"That was pretty tough. Can't do anything about it now. Just get back to work.\"\n\nPrior to that, though, Nelson has been every bit an ace for the Brewers, going 8-3 with a 2.96 ERA over a 16-start stretch. He has struggled against the Pirates in 2017, though, going 0-1 with a 4.50 ERA with seven strikeouts in eight innings over two starts.\n\nOverall, Nelson is 5-4 with a 3.64 ERA in 12 career starts against Pittsburgh,\n\nThe Pirates will send right-hander Gerrit Cole to the mound, and he will try to continue his success against Milwaukee this year: 1-0 with 1.29 ERA in three starts. He is 3-3 with a 2.95 ERA in 10 starts vs. the Brewers in his career. Cole is 1-2 with a 4.37 ERA in four career starts at Miller Park.\n\nCole has been red hot over the past six weeks, going 4-1 with a 2.74 ERA in five starts since the beginning of July.\n\n\"I guess it's been pretty good,\" Cole said of his recent success. \"There's still room for improvement. (I'm) still getting nicked here and there. I'll try to get better for the next one.\"\n\nThe Pirates (58-61) have lost three in a row to fall 4 1/2 games behind the Cubs, but they could get a boost with the return of Francisco Cervelli. The catcher missed Pittsburgh's past three games with a sore left wrist but won't need a trip to the disabled list, according to manager Clint Hurdle.\n\n\"This is an injury he will need to play through,\" Hurdle said. \"(The time off was) an opportunity for us to calm it down a little bit.\"\n\nCervelli is batting .500 in six games against Milwaukee this season but is 3-for-14 (.214) in his

That's why we're winning.\"\n\nKeon Broxton homered twice and Neil Walker and Travis Shaw also went deep as Milwaukee completed a sweep of the two-game series with its fourth straight win after an extended offensive slump.\n\n\"It's certainly fun when you hit home runs,\" Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.\n\nPina's one-out shot to right field came off Pirates reliever Juan Nicasio (1-5). The 30-year-old rookie glanced into the Brewers' dugout before watching the ball disappear over the outfield wall.\n\n\"The clubhouse, the dugout, we're feeling the energy,\" Pina said. \"We feel like this is the team we used to be in the first half.\"\n\nThe Pirates grabbed an early lead on Josh Bell's run-scoring single. Pittsburgh extended the lead to 4-0 in the third on consecutive two-out singles by Andrew McCutchen, Bell and David Freese.\n\nThe Brewers broke through in the third on Broxton's leadoff home run. After Eric Sogard walked, Walker smacked a homer against his former team to cut Milwaukee's deficit to 4-3.\n\nShaw's leadoff homer in the sixth, the third home run off Pittsburgh starter Gerrit Cole, tied the score.\n\nCole, who entered the game having won his past seven starts on the road, gave up four runs and five hits in six innings. He struck out nine and walked three.\n\n\"They are a dangerous club,\" Cole said. \"It is just frustrating to get spotted that (lead) and not be able to hold it. That's kind of the sour taste in my mouth right now.\"\n\nPittsburgh regained the lead in the seventh on Josh Harrison's RBI single. John Jaso scored from second base, sliding in just ahead of the tag, a call that stood after a brief review.\n\nThe Brewers tied it again in the bottom of the inning when Broxton led off with his second homer of the game, a shot to left off reliever George Kontos.\n\nBell led off the eighth with a triple and scored on Adam Frazier's single off Milwaukee reliever Anthony Swarzak (1-0).\n\nBrewers starter Jimmy Nelson, who allowed a career-high 10 runs in his previous outing, settled down after the shaky third inning, retiring 11 consecutive batters during one stretch. He gave up five runs, three earned, and eight hits in 6\u00aa innings. Nelson struck out seven and walked one.\n\nCorey Knebel earned his 24th save in 29 chances.\n\nCole turned in three dominating performances against the Brewers this season until falling victim to the long ball on Wednesday. Cole pitched seven innings and surrendered just one run in each of his previous outings against Milwaukee. Overall, he was 7-0 in his last seven starts on the road. With the no decision on Wednesday, Cole still hasn't lost since May 22 in Atlanta.\n\n\"They were able to do damage on the swings that they took,\" Cole said. \"It was unfortunate I couldn't hold them down.\"\n\nAdded motivation\n\nBroxton started in center field after watching infielder Jonathan Villar get his first-ever start at the position on Tuesday night.\n\n\"I'd be lying if I said it didn't,\" Broxton said when asked if the decision served as motivation. \"It definitely does. I want to be out there playing and helping the team. But if I'm not doing it at that time, I have to be respectful of what Counsell wants.\"\n\nCounsell praised Broxton's work ethic.\n\n\"He's worked on his game tremendously hard,\" Counsell said. \"But he'll be the first guy cheering you on in the dugout if he's not playing.\"\n\nFrom the infirmary\n\nBrewers shortstop Orlando Arcia sat out for the second consecutive game with back spasms.\n\n* Outfielder Ryan Braun got a routine day off.\n\n* Catcher Stephen Vogt (left knee sprain) is expected to make one more rehab start before likely rejoining Milwaukee for a weekend series in Colorado.\n\nUp next\n\nBrewers right-hander Matt Garza (6-6, 4.38 ERA) takes the mound as Milwaukee opens a three-game series at Colorado on Friday.\n\nBrandon Woodruff (1-1, 1.50), who had been scheduled to start on Friday, will take the mound Saturday.\n\nColorado is expected to send out right-hander German Marquez (9-5, 4.13) on Friday.\n\nTucson woos Brewers\n\nPima County officials sent a 17-page package to the Brewers last week in an effort to bring them to Kino Sports Complex in Tucson, Arizona, for spring training.\n\nThe Brewers train at Maryvale Baseball Park in Phoenix, but the team's contract is year-to-year.\n\nThe team has recently pushed for a move to Gilbert, but Mayor Jenn Daniels was not interested in the idea of spending taxpayer money on the facility.\n\nThe Brewers state they've discussed a new, long-term lease in Maryvale, but are looking to expand attendance, which is limited in Maryvale.\n\nPittsburgh AB R H BI BB SO Avg.\n\nMarte lf 5 2 2 0 0 1 .250\n\nHarrison 2b 4 1 1 1 1 2 .275\n\nMcCutchen cf 4 1 1 1 0 1 .286\n\nBell 1b 4 1 3 2 0 0 .260\n\nFreese 3b 4 0 1 1 0 2 .262\n\nFrazier rf 4 0 1 1 0 1 .279\n\nMercer ss 4 0 0 0 0 1 .249\n\nStewart c 4 0 2 0 0 2 .198\n\nCole p 2 0 0 0 0 1 .143\n\nJaso ph 1 1 0 0 0 0 .212\n\nRodriguez rf 1 0 0 0 0 0 .193\n\nTotals 37 6 11 6 1 11\n\nMilwaukee AB R H BI BB SO Avg.\n\nSogard ss 3 1 0 0 1 2 .284\n\nWalker 2b 3 1 2 2 1 0 .273\n\nSantana rf 4 0 0 0 0 3 .269\n\nShaw 3b 4 1 1 1 0 2 .293\n\nAguilar 1b 3 1 1 0 1 0 .263\n\nPina c 4 1 2 2 0 1 .290\n\nPerez lf 4 0 0 0 0 2 .258\n\nBroxton cf 4 2 2 2 0 2 .226\n\nNelson p 2 0 0 0 0 2 .083\n\nThames ph 1 0 0 0 0 1 .243\n\nTotals 32 7 8 7 3 15\n\nPittsburgh 103 000 110 -- 6 11 0\n\nMilwaukee 003 001 12x -- 7 8 2\n\nE -- Aguilar (6), Nelson (2).

Keon Broxton hit a pair, Neil Walker hit his first in a Brewers uniform, Travis Shaw smacked No. 26 this season and Manny Pina gave Milwaukee the lead for good with a two-run shot in the bottom of the eighth.\n\nThe Brewers pulled within a game of the National League Central-leading Cubs, who will play later Wednesday. The Pirates temporarily fell five games back.\n\nPina's homer against Juan Nicasio made a winner of Brewers reliever Anthony Swarzak, who had just surrendered a go-ahead run to the Pirates in the top of the inning on Adam Frazier's one-out single. The hit scored Josh Bell, who led the way for the Pirates with three hits -- including two of their two-out, run-scoring singles. Bell led off the eighth with a stand-up triple before Frazier drove him home.\n\nMOMENTS THAT MATTERED\n\nBroxton heats up: Broxton, a former Pirate, came off the bench Tuesday night to hit a pinch-hit solo home run, and he stayed hot Wednesday afternoon by hitting a solo home run to right field in the third inning to start a three-run Brewers strike, and a tying solo home run to left field in the seventh. It gave the streaky Broxton 19 home runs this season -- and three in the span of four plate appearances.\n\nPirates capitalize on errors: Pittsburgh scored a pair of go-ahead runs thanks to Brewers errors. In the first inning, Nelson's errant pickoff attempt pushed Starling Marte to third base for Bell's two-out single and a 1-0 lead. In the seventh, John Jaso's grounder glanced off first baseman Jesus Aguilar's glove for another error, and Jaso eventually scored for a 5-4 lead on Josh Harrison's two-out hit. Jaso scored ahead of a two-hop throw home from Brewers left fielder Hernan Perez, a call that stood upon review after the Brewers challenged.\n\nWalker stays hot: After the Pirates extended their lead to 4-0 with five singles off Brewers starter Jimmy Nelson in a three-run third inning, the Brewers powered their way back into the game in the home half against Pittsburgh starter Gerrit Cole. Broxton's solo homer leading off the frame was his second in as many at-bats (he hit a pinch-hit homer in Tuesday's win), and two batters later, Walker cut the deficit to 4-3 with a two-run shot. It was Walker's first home run since coming to the Brewers in a weekend trade with the Mets.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\nPirates: Jameson Taillon will take the ball to open a four-game series against the Cardinals at 7:05 p.m. ET on Thursday. The right-hander has yet to beat St. Louis in his career and is 0-1 with a 4.91 ERA in two starts this season.\n\nBrewers: The Brewers are off on Thursday before heading out west for a nine-game road trip, beginning with a three-game series at Colorado on Friday. Matt Garza will take the mound in the series opener at 7:40 p.m. CT. The Rockies will counter with right-hander German Marquez. Garza has not faced the Rockies this season, but he is 2-5 with a 6.10 ERA in seven career starts against them.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 49,

Davies scattered six hits, one run and two walks with two strikeouts over 6 \u2154 innings, getting himself back on track after a one-game hiccup in his previous start and the Milwaukee Brewers their third straight victory, 3-1, at Miller Park.\n\n\"He did things a little different today,\" manager Craig Counsell said. \"He got ready early and had a little extra time, almost like it was a road game. He was trying to change something up.\n\n\"It's been early at home when he's gotten beat. I think the ground balls are key for him. When you're seeing ground balls, you're getting off-balance swings a little out front or beat with the fastball.\n\n\"That's a good sign for me, and he did a nice job of it.\"\n\n#Brewers starter Zach Davies talks about close win over Pirates and new momentum. pic.twitter.com/NjkrjC3XmT -- Tom (@Haudricourt)\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\nDavies has indeed had issues in the opening frame this season. Coming into Tuesday, he'd logged a 7.12 ERA and opposing batters had hit him at a .320 clip in his previous 24 starts. Both numbers were the worst in any inning for him, with the second inning a close second.\n\nIn his previous start against the Minnesota Twins, Davies allowed three second-inning runs and three more in the third en route to arguably his worst outing of the season. And it was his last start against the Pirates at Miller Park on June 20 that he pitched his worst first inning, allowing six runs in an eventual 7-3 loss.\n\nBOX SCORE: Brewers 3, Pirates 1\n\nRELATED: Brewers scratch out win with balanced effort\n\nNOTES: Brewers try Jonathan Villar in center field\n\nRELATED: Milwaukee Brewers weekly minor-league report\n\nMLB: Live scoreboard, box scores, standings, schedules\n\nHe got off on a much stronger note in this one, recording five straight ground-ball outs and then fanning Adam Frazier for a scoreless first two frames.\n\nDavies then worked around multiple baserunners in the third, fourth and fifth thanks to some strong defense from Eric Sogard, Neil Walker and Travis Shaw in particular before Pittsburgh finally scored on him in the sixth on Frazier's RBI triple to briefly pull even at 1-1.\n\nThat's when Walker again delivered defensively, this time smothering Jordy Mercer's ground ball toward the hole on the right side to keep the potential go-ahead run from scoring.\n\nDavies' night ended in the seventh inning at 101 pitches, and Jared Hughes came on to get the final out to strand Starling Marte at second.\n\nThe Brewers grabbed the lead back in the bottom of the inning on Manny Pi\u00f1a's RBI infield single and stayed in front the rest of the way with Jacob Barnes and Corey Knebel combining on a scoreless final three innings to finish it out.\n\nDavies earned the victory, improving to 14-4 overall while lowering his ERA to 4.26.\n\nHe said the tweak to his pre-game preparations helped set the stage for his performance by allowing him some extra time to focus and catch his breath - a somewhat different approach considering many players try to rev themselves up as much as possible before storming the field.\n\n\"Just getting ready earlier, getting a little bit of a break between warming up and the bullpen and going out on the mound - that's really all it was,\" he said. \"I think it gives you time to relax and settle in instead of going out there a little bit more on adrenaline, a little bit more energetic.\n\n\"Kind of just brings you back down. At least for me, a guy who's a command guy and trying to spot it, that's the biggest thing.\"\n\nCounsell said Davies was back to looking more like the pitcher that had rattled off five wins in seven starts since July 1 rather than the one who struggled against the Twins.\n\n\"It was back to the good ones like we saw in that little stretch he was on,\" he said. \"His good outings, to me, he keeps the hitter guessing. Any time, any count, the hitter can never get comfortable with the speed or a pitch that's coming.\n\n\"He did a nice job keeping them off balance. I thought we played really nice defense as well. It was a nice outing, for sure.\"\n\nAlso to no one's surprise, the Brewers and Pirates played yet another close game. It marked the seventh straight time a game had been decided by two or fewer runs between them. Milwaukee had been swept in four straight at PNC Park from July 17-20 opening what wound up being a disastrous 2-8 road trip.\n\nPi\u00f1a drove in the first two runs of the game for the Brewers, then former Pirate Keon Broxton applied the finishing touches with his 17th home run of the season in the seventh.\n\n#Brewers Keon Broxton talks about his big pinch hit HR in 3-1 win over Pirates. pic.twitter.com/GhC46gpLy8 -- Tom (@Haudricourt)\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\n\"These last three series in a row, we're playing tight games every single night,\" said Counsell. \"It seems like every game is two runs, one run - they're evenly matched. It's a run-prevention game, keeping runs off the board.\n\n\"They've all been low-scoring games where defense matters. It puts pressure on the pitchers to make quality pitches, but they've been making quality pitches.\"\n\nAdded Davies: \"Just a good battle. Both teams care about the game, both teams are in it to win it and it might be another rivalry within the division. Going forward it's going to be tight throughout the rest of this race, so we're going to go out there and try to win every inning.\"\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 49, "label": "dmoz/Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "wgt": 100, "id": 52, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 137, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "wgt": 100, "id": 205, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "wgt": 100, "id": 641, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "type": "loc", "id": "225137"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field#Home_plate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302619", "label": {"eng": "Home plate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303571", "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303573", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303711", "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303713", "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303714", "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304992", "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305016", "label": {"eng": "Batting (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305018", "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305020", "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305787", "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305791", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305794", "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305802", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "305860", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "310507", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310511", "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "310537", "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closer_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310664", "label": {"eng": "Closer (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "325678", "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Walker_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "325935", "label": {"eng": "Neil Walker (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "331803", "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starling_Marte", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "375717", "label": {"eng": "Starling Marte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordy_Mercer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "406535", "label": {"eng": "Jordy Mercer"}}]}

It was the fourth consecutive triumph for the Brewers, who swept the two-game set from the Pirates.\n\nWhen the day was done, the Brewers had scored all seven of their runs by hitting five homers, including two by Keon Broxton. The Pirates' total of six RBI singles was not enough.\n\nBoth starting pitchers had major hiccups in the third inning, each giving up three runs. Jimmy Nelson's troubles started after his opposite number, Gerrit Cole, bunted into a double play, leaving none on with two outs.\n\nBOX SCORE: Brewers 7, Pirates 6\n\nMLB: Live scoreboard, box scores, standings, schedules\n\nStarling Marte singled and stole second, and Josh Harrison walked, setting up consecutive run-scoring singles by Andrew McCutchen, Josh Bell and David Freese. Just like that, Pittsburgh's 1-0 lead expanded to 4-0 and the Brewers appeared to be in big trouble against Cole, who had a 1.20 ERA against them in three previous starts this season.\n\nBut the Brewers turned to an old friend - the home run - to start peeling layers off the Pirates' lead. Broxton, who had a big pinch-hit home run the previous evening, led off the bottom of the inning with an opposite-field shot to right, his 18th of the season.\n\nEric Sogard drew a one-out walk and Neil Walker hurt his hometown (and former) club with a two-run homer to right, his first with the Brewers. Suddenly, the Brewers were back in the game.\n\nTravis Shaw brought the Brewers all the way back when he led off the bottom of the sixth with a shot to right, his 26th of the season.\n\nAn error by first baseman Jesus Aguilar paved the way for an unearned run off Nelson in the seventh, putting the Pirates back on top, 5-4. The run-scoring single by Harrison came off Jared Hughes, who took over with two on and one out.\n\nAgain, the Brewers answered with the long ball. Broxton greeted reliever George Kontos with a homer in the bottom of the inning - a line shot to left on a 1-2 slider.\n\nBut the Pirates kept coming. Reliever Anthony Swarzak, out of action a few days with a stiff neck, returned to action in the eighth and was greeted by a booming triple to right by Bell. Swarzak struck out Freese looking but Adam Frazier collected Pittsburgh's sixth run-scoring single of the day to make it 6-5.\n\nBEHIND THE BOX SCORE\n\n\" SS Orlando Arcia missed his second consecutive game after suffering back spasms. Manager Craig Counsell said Arcia tweaked his back taking swings in the cage Tuesday afternoon. With a scheduled day off Thursday, Arcia will get more rest before the Brewers open a weekend series in Colorado.\n\n\"He's doing better,\" Counsell said. \"The back is still bugging him. I wouldn't say for sure on Friday but I'm hopeful it's Friday.\"\n\n\" Beyond Arcia, Ryan Braun, Eric Thames and Jonathan Villar were out of the starting lineup. Despite having team off days on Monday and Thursday, Counsell said it was a planned off day for Braun, who was 1-for-10 against Cole.\n\nSTAT SHEET\n\n\" The Brewers surpassed 2 million in home attendance on their 65th date at Miller Park this season. They have drawn at least 2 million for 14 consecutive seasons. The last time they finished below that mark was 2003 with 1.7 million and change.\n\n\" Aguilar, who started in place of Thames at first base, is 0 for his last 18 at the plate.\n\nTAKEAWAY\n\nThe Brewers have been reliant all year on home runs to score and that certainly didn't change on this day. When the home runs dried up in the weeks coming out of the all-star break, the entire team went into a slump. Now, the long ball is back.\n\nRECORD\n\nThis year: 63-59 (35-30 home; 28-29 away)\n\nLast year: 52-70\n\nATTENDANCE\n\nWednesday: 32,439\n\n2017 total: 2,017,115 (31,033 avg.)\n\nLast year: 1,866,930 (28,722 avg.)\n\nNEXT GAME\n\nFriday: Brewers at Rockies, 7:40 p.m. Milwaukee RHP Matt Garza (6-6, 4.38) vs. Colorado RHP German Marquez (9-5, 4.13).

With their third straight victory, the Brewers moved up into a virtual tie with the Cardinals for second place in the National League Central.\n\nThe Cardinals lead the Brewers by one game in the loss column, and both teams still trail the division-leading Cubs, who were still in progress at Wrigley Field against the Reds when Corey Knebel threw the final pitch 90 miles north to notch his 23rd save.\n\nDavies allowed a run on six hits in 6 2/3 innings for his team-leading 14th victory in a good pitching matchup against Ivan Nova. The Pirates' right-hander pitched six innings and surrendered two runs (one earned) on four hits and three walks, but he couldn't solve Brewers third baseman Travis Shaw.

He made a sliding stop to his left to keep Jordy Mercer's grounder on the infield and threw to first in time to end the inning. The stellar play positioned the Brewers to push ahead in the bottom of the inning.\n\nWell-placed: Pirates manager Clint Hurdle had already burned his challenge by the bottom of the sixth when the Brewers took the lead with two outs on a close play at first base. With runners at the corners, Pina hit a bouncer to the left side of the infield that glanced off third baseman David Freese's glove to the shortstop Mercer, who made a quick transfer and threw on time to first base. But as he stretched for the baseball, Josh Bell's foot came off the bag, according to first-base umpire Hunter Wendelstedt, allowing Pina to reach on an infield hit as Shaw scored for a 2-1 lead. Bell signaled to the dugout for a challenge, but the Pirates lost it back in the fourth inning.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100, "id": 36,

Jonathan Villar (9) and/or Manny Pina (8) can propel this Milwaukee team to a new record.\n\nThe Brewers have five players this season thus far with 10 or more steals. While Milwaukee teams have had more players with 10 or more steals previously (with a high of 11 in 1992), only once has a National League Brewers squad had more than the current five, in 2012 (with six). Travis Shaw (9) and Ryan Braun (8) could mean the Brewers have seven players with 10+ steals, joining only the 1992, 1990 (8), 1989 (8) and 1987 (7) teams with that many.\n\nWhen you put together players who have 10 or more homers and 10 or more steals in the same season, the 2017 squad is tied with five other Brewers teams -- 1973, 1987, 2005, 2008 and 2012 -- with four such players having accomplished that feat. As mentioned above, Villar, Shaw and/or Braun could easily make this the best power-speed combo team in franchise history.\n\nPLAYER HR SB Eric Thames 27 3 Travis Shaw 25 9 Domingo Santana 19 10 Keon Broxton 16 19 Ryan Braun 13 8 Hernan Perez 12 11 Orlando Arcia 11 11 Jesus Aguilar 11 0 Jonathan Villar 9 21 Manny Pina 8 0 Jett Bandy 6 1 Stephen Vogt 4 0 Eric Sogard 3 3 Nick Franklin 2 2 Lewis Brinson 2 1 Brett Phillips 2 1 Kirk Niewenhuis 1 0\n\nOther notes:\n\n-- Milwaukee is 14-8 (.636) in its last 22 home games, which is the third-best record in MLB since June 21.\n\n-- Travis Shaw has four homers against Pittsburgh this season, which is tied for most vs. the Pirates for any player this season.\n\n-- Pittsburgh's Ivan Nova owns a 34-game streak with allowing two or fewer walks while teammate Jameson Taillon is on a 13-game streak. Nova has had 23 such starts in 2017, the most in MLB. The Pirates' Gerrit Cole is second with 22. Milwaukee's Zach Davies and Jimmy Nelson are tied for fourth-most with 20.\n\n-- The Pirates own a 2.36 ERA against the Brewers this season, best of any NL team vs. a divisional opponent in 2017.\n\nStatistics courtesy STATS and baseball-reference", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "wgt": 100, "id": 381, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "wgt": 100, "id": 435, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "type": "loc", "id": "222244"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "type": "loc", "id": "225137"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303573", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304991", "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "305018", "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305791", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "310507", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "310546", "label": {"eng": "National League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310672", "label": {"eng": "Texas Rangers (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels_of_Anaheim", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "312731", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "327981", "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iv\u00e1n_Nova", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "334563", "label": {"eng": "Iv\u00e1n Nova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros_minor_league_players#Jonathan_Villar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "391085", "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Villar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domingo_Santana", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "393823", "label": {"eng": "Domingo Santana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameson_Taillon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "417653", "label": {"eng": "Jameson Taillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Braun", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "506080", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Braun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Sogard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "659996", "label": {"eng": "Eric Sogard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Thames", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "933639", "label": {"eng": "Eric Thames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox_minor_league_players#Travis_Shaw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1289889", "label": {"eng": "Travis Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Arcia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1320671", "label": {"eng": "Orlando Arcia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Franklin_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1357045", "label": {"eng": "Nick Franklin (baseball)"}}]}

We had a good series against Cincinnati, Zach (Davies) pitched great again (Tuesday night), and we scored enough runs to win.\"\n\nMilwaukee's offense got a boost from the addition of Neil Walker, who has three hits in his first two games since coming over from the New York Mets. He also has been impressive in the field and is likely to see a majority of the action at second base down the stretch.\n\n\"He (has) played really well,\" manager Craig Counsell said. \"He knows what he's doing.\"\n\nJimmy Nelson (9-6, 3.72 ERA) gets the ball for Milwaukee, looking to bounce back after a rough outing last week against the Cincinnati Reds when he was tagged for 10 runs (nine earned) on 11 hits and three walks in 3 2/3 innings.\n\n\"When it rains, it pours,\" Nelson said after that outing. \"That was pretty tough. Can't do anything about it now. Just get back to work.\"\n\nPrior to that, though, Nelson has been every bit an ace for the Brewers, going 8-3 with a 2.96 ERA over a 16-start stretch. He has struggled against the Pirates in 2017, though, going 0-1 with a 4.50 ERA with seven strikeouts in eight innings over two starts.\n\nOverall, Nelson is 5-4 with a 3.64 ERA in 12 career starts against Pittsburgh,\n\nThe Pirates will send right-hander Gerrit Cole to the mound, and he will try to continue his success against Milwaukee this year: 1-0 with 1.29 ERA in three starts. He is 3-3 with a 2.95 ERA in 10 starts vs. the Brewers in his career. Cole is 1-2 with a 4.37 ERA in four career starts at Miller Park.\n\nCole has been red hot over the past six weeks, going 4-1 with a 2.74 ERA in five starts since the beginning of July.\n\n\"I guess it's been pretty good,\" Cole said of his recent success. \"There's still room for improvement. (I'm) still getting nicked here and there. I'll try to get better for the next one.\"\n\nThe Pirates (58-61) have lost three in a row to fall 4 1/2 games behind the Cubs, but they could get a boost with the return of Francisco Cervelli. The catcher missed Pittsburgh's past three games with a sore left wrist but won't need a trip to the disabled list, according to manager Clint Hurdle.\n\n\"This is an injury he will need to play through,\" Hurdle said. \"(The time off was) an opportunity for us to calm it down a little bit.\"\n\nCervelli is batting .500 in six games against Milwaukee this season but is 3-for-14 (.214) in his career against Nelson.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 49, "label": "dmoz/Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51,

Milwaukee has won four straight, a winning streak preceded by a six-game losing streak.\n\nMore Brewers coverage Preview: Brewers at RockiesInjury derails Brewers prospect Brinson's minor-league seasonBrewers players attempt to pronounce Wisconsin town namesBrewers Final Pitch: Tough road trip up nextWATCH: Brewers pummel Pirates with 5 home runs\n\nThe Brewers went into the All-Star break with a 5 1/2-game lead in the NL Central but has since gone 13-18 to slip a game behind the Chicago Cubs. Since the break, the Brewers are 4-11 on the road.\n\nThe Brewers and Rockies began the season at Miller Park, with Colorado winning three of four games. The Brewers are 12-13 against the NL West and 4-7 against the Rockies, Giants and Dodgers.\n\nThe Rockies have lost seven of their past 10 games overall but are 37-23 at home. The Dodgers, quite simply, are a juggernaut at a major-league-best 85-34. And while the disappointing Giants have the second-worst record in the NL, the Brewers are 22-36 all-time in San Francisco and last won a series there in 2010. So Milwaukee's trip won't be easy.\n\n\"There's a challenge every single night,\" Brewers manager Craig Counsell told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \"It's, 'Play a good game.' I think if we play a good game, we have a really good chance to win. That's how you look at it.\n\n\"The schedule is something totally out of our control. It's in front of us the next day. The schedule says, 'Be here. This is who you're facing.' That's how you have to treat it.\"\n\nGarza is 2-5 with a 6.10 ERA in seven career starts against the Rockies and 0-3 with an 8.82 ERA in three starts at Coors Field.\n\nThe Brewers are 9-9 in games started this year by Garza, who won his last start 7-4 Sunday against Cincinnati while giving up five hits, five walks and four runs (three earned) in 5 1/3 innings. Garza has not pitched six innings in any of his past six starts.\n\nMarquez's four-game winning streak ended Sunday at Miami, where he allowed seven hits and five runs in 4 1/3 innings as the Rockies fell 5-3. Colorado is 12-8 in starts by Marquez, who is 5-0 with a 2.72 ERA in his past seven starts at Coors Field and 0-0 with a 3.00 ERA in one start against Milwaukee last year.\n\nRockies first baseman Mark Reynolds will be facing his former team this weekend.\n\nIn his one season with the Brewers in 2014, Reynolds hit just .196 with 22 homers and 45 RBIs in 130 games. However, the 34-year-old veteran has been a difference-maker this year in his second season with the Rockies.\n\nIn December, Colorado signed Ian Desmond to a five-year, $70 million contract to play first base. On Feb. 1, the Rockies signed Reynolds to a minor league contract, with the intent of having him provide right-handed power off the bench.\n\nHowever, Desmond opened the season on the disabled list with a broken left hand and is on the disabled list again with a right calf strain. He has played just 65 games, more in left field than at first base.\n\nReynolds, meanwhile, is hitting .280 with 25 homers, 80 RBIs and an .880 OPS in 113 games.\n\n\"The thing I'm most proud of is I took advantage of an opportunity,\" Reynolds said. \"I don't wish ill on anyone, but unfortunately Desi got hurt and I was able to kind of cement myself in the lineup.\n\n\"I remember I first talked to (manager) Buddy (Black) when I signed, and I told him, 'I know the situation. My main goal is to make it hard on you to take me out of the lineup.' And I'm really proud of myself that I was able to stay consistent and produce, and like I said, take advantage of the opportunity I was given.\"", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri":

In his 147.2 innings and 10-8 record this year, Cole has a 3.96 ERA with 132 Ks and 36 BBs.\n\nThe Pirates have some key bats this year. Andrew McCutchen came into this set with 119 hits, 73 runs, 23 homers and 71 RBI, while Josh Harrison had 116 hits, 53 runs, 12 homers and 38 RBI. Harrison and McCutchen combined to go 0-for-7 on Tuesday.\n\nOver on the Brewers' side, they're going with RHP Jimmy Nelson for the start. In his 145.1 innings and 9-6 record this year, Nelson has a 3.72 ERA with 162 Ks and 37 BBs.\n\nMilwaukee has some notable bats as well. Travis Shaw entered this set with 116 hits, 63 runs, 25 homers and 78 RBI while Orlando Arcia had 113 hits, 46 runs, 11 homers and 39 RBI. Shaw plated two runs on Tuesday; Arcia was a late scratch with back spasms.\n\nThe Pirates are 3-7 in their last 10 Wednesday games, and 1-6 in the last seven during game two of a series. Pittsburgh is also 7-0 in Cole's last seven road starts and 6-1 in Cole's last seven starts.\n\nMeanwhile, the Brewers are 0-4 in their last four Wednesday games and 5-1 in Nelson's last six home starts. Milwaukee is also 1-4 in Nelson's last five starts and 1-6 in Nelson's last seven Wednesday starts.\n\nCole has been on a great run lately. He's got seven straight quality starts, and has given up seven earned over his last three appearances in 21.0 innings. As for Nelson, he had three straight quality starts going but then coughed nine earned on 11 hits in 3.2 innings against the Reds. This should be a really nice pitching matchup, so the under doesn't seem like a bad play. I like Cole to keep it going and help the Pirates get a win here as well.\n\nOur Top Ranked Sportsbook BetDSI - get 100% Deposit Bonus NOW ANDREW'S PICK Under 8.5 More Expert Picks Get Guaranteed Winners from loads of proven cappers at Sports Chat Place Experts Start Winning \" See Next MLB Pick >> Comments (0)\n\nName:\n\nEmail:\n\nWebsite:\n\nNotify of New Replies:\n\nAllowed tags: <b><i><br>Add a new comment:\n\nPreview Post", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 49, "label": "dmoz/Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 50, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100, "id": 223, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "wgt": 100, "id": 641, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 100, "id": 710, "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "type": "loc", "id": "222244"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "type": "loc", "id": "225137"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302624", "label": {"eng": "Hit (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303571", "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303573", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303711", "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303713", "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304254", "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304992", "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305021", "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305023", "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305786", "label": {"eng": "Batting average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305791", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305802", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "310507", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "310537", "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCutchen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "357625", "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCutchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Harrison", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "375719", "label": {"eng": "Josh Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrit_Cole", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "375725", "label": {"eng": "Gerrit Cole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_Park_(Milwaukee)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "442431", "label": {"eng": "Miller Park (Milwaukee)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox_minor_league_players#Travis_Shaw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1289889", "label": {"eng": "Travis Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Arcia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1320671", "label": {"eng": "Orlando Arcia"}}]}

It took a Cubs walk-off win the night before to keep Milwaukee 1 1/2 games out of first place in the National League Central ahead of what could be a defining road trip.\n\n\"They're playing very inspired baseball,\" said newcomer Neil Walker, who was still getting used to referring to himself as a member of the Brewers. \"We know what's at stake here, but I don't see anybody pressing, I don't see anybody trying to do more than they're capable of. That's a sign of a good team.\"\n\nOf the pending trip, Walker said, \"It's going to be a good test. Colorado is playing well, obviously the Dodgers are playing well and San Francisco is not an easy place. We know what's at stake.\"\n\nThe Brewers only recently started showing the good traits which drew Walker's praise. They scored three or fewer runs in 19 of 25 games before a players-only meeting a week ago, following the fifth of six straight losses.\n\nIn five games since, the Brewers lead the Majors with 13 home runs and trail only the Cubs among NL clubs with 6.6 runs per game. In its only loss during that stretch, Milwaukee came back from a 10-2 deficit against Cincinnati before falling, 11-10.\n\n\"The momentum is really good right now,\" said center fielder Keon Broxton after hitting two of the Brewers' five home runs in Wednesday's 7-6 win over the Pirates, Milwaukee's fourth in a row. \"The vibe in the clubhouse is awesome. I think everyone is getting back to playing baseball the way we knew how, and that's really fun for us, the fans, everyone. It's really relaxed in here right now, and we just have to continue on.\"\n\nHere's a look at the road ahead, with stats through Wednesday:\n\nFriday-Sunday at Colorado\n\nRockies: 67-53, lead NL Wild Card race\n\nWhat to know: Believe it or not, the Rockies were in an offensive rut of their own before a 17-2 rout of the Braves on Wednesday, scoring three or fewer runs in their eight previous games. ... After struggling in Texas, Lucroy was 10-for-30 to start his career with Colorado after being acquired in a trade. ... The Rockies bolstered their bullpen in July with right-hander Pat Neshek, who has a 0.89 ERA in 19 career appearances against Milwaukee. ... The Brewers get a big boost on Sunday, when Chase Anderson is scheduled to return from the disabled list. He had a 2.89 ERA in 16 starts before suffering a left oblique strain at the end of June.\n\nMonday-Wednesday at San Francisco\n\nGiants: 48-74, last in NL West\n\nWhat to know: The Brewers will miss Madison Bumgarner, who is scheduled to start Sunday against the Phillies. He's 7-2 with a 2.25 ERA in 10 career starts against Milwaukee. ... The Giants have pitched well to start the month of August. Their 3.56 ERA through Wednesday trailed only the Dodgers among NL clubs. ... The Brewers have lost 35 of 55 games at AT&T Park since it opened in 2000, and Milwaukee's pitchers have a 4.67 ERA there.\n\nAug. 25-27 at Los Angeles\n\nDodgers: 85-34, best record in MLB\n\nWhat to know: Where to start? With Yasiel Puig's walk-off double against the White Sox on Wednesday, the Dodgers were just shy of a 116-win pace, which is the MLB regular-season record. It was the 50th win in 59 games for Los Angeles, which has not lost a series since early June. ... Clayton Kershaw remains sidelined by a lower-back strain. He's throwing simulated games, but he is not expected back by the time the Brewers come to town. It appears Milwaukee will catch Trade Deadline acquisition Yu Darvish, however. ... Ryan Braun, a boyhood Dodgers fan, has a 1.063 OPS and 16 extra-base hits in 25 career starts at Dodger Stadium.\n\nBrewers manager Craig Counsell tried not to overstate the importance of their big trip.\n\n\"I don't see any productivity in that,\" Counsell said. \"We're going to Colorado. We're playing Colorado, San Fran and L.A. That's who we play next. There's challenge every single night. I think if we play a good game, we have a really good chance to win. That's how you look at it.\"", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 49, "label": "dmoz/Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id":

Since almost no one gave the rebuilding Brewers a chance in the National League Central Division, it seemed more likely that Counsell would be auditioning young players in mid-August instead of trying to pull meaningful strings and make plans for a pennant race.\n\nYet, here the Brewers are, doggedly sticking like glue to the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals in the NL Central race after a 7-6, come-from-behind -- three times, actually -- victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates at Miller Park.\n\nGetting here hasn't been easy for Milwaukee.\n\nThe starting pitching faltered in April, the bullpen collapsed in June and the home runs stopped for three weeks after the All-Star break, leading to 12 losses in 19 games. Injuries and erratic play have led to regular roster shuffles, with the team cycling through 20 position players and 28 pitchers so far.\n\nDespite intense anticipation, there were no major additions at the non-waiver trade deadline, with only a couple of veteran arms added to the bullpen.\n\nThrough it all, the Brewers have used their depth and resiliency to stay competitive and, surprisingly, are now 63-59 and lined up almost perfectly for the final six weeks of a pennant race they weren't supposed to be in.\n\nThe Brewers have the momentum generated by four consecutive wins, their bats have finally come alive with 13 home runs and 33 runs in their past five games, the Saturday trade for veteran second baseman Neil Walker already has paid dividends and starting pitcher Chase Anderson and catcher Stephen Vogt are coming off the disabled list in time for this weekend's series with the Rockies.\n\nAll in all, the Brewers are sitting about as well as could be expected with 40 games to play, starting with a difficult nine-game, three-city trip out West.\n\n\"I feel like we're pretty close to full strength right now,\" Counsell said. \"That's all we can ask for is that roster-wise and health-wise we're in a really good place in these last 40 games. From that perspective, I think we're in really good shape.\"\n\nNo one is saying the Brewers are a great team or even a playoff team. But unless they fall flat on their faces against the Rockies, San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers in the next 12 days, they're going to be playing meaningful games in September.\n\nBetter yet, the team they put on the field will be as healthy, rested and complete as it has been all season.\n\nIndeed, the young Brewers are about as ready as they'll ever be to capitalize on this ahead-of-schedule opportunity.\n\nThey may not be talented or experienced enough to outlast seasoned teams like the Cubs and Cardinals, but they at least have a chance in a season that was devoid of expectations at the start.\n\n\"Every guy we have in this locker room has a job and they're really beneficial to our team,\" said outfielder Keon Broxton, who hit two of Milwaukee's five home runs Wednesday. \"Getting Chase back and Vogt back is going to be huge. ... It's nice to get the entire foundation back.\"\n\nWalker, who was acquired from the New York Mets late Saturday night, has made an impact after just three games with his hitting, fielding and, according to Counsell, voice of experience in the dugout.\n\nA veteran of three playoff teams in Pittsburgh, Walker likes what he sees of the Brewers.\n\n\"They're playing very inspired baseball,\" Walker said after hitting his first home run with the Brewers. \"We know what's at stake here, but I don't see anybody pressing. I don't see anybody trying to do more than what they're capable of. That's the sign of a good team.\n\n\"We're just trying to give ourselves opportunities, pitch well and play good defense. Usually, that's a good recipe for success.\"\n\nIn a curious move for such an important game, Counsell rested outfielder Ryan Braun, shortstop Orlando Arcia and first baseman Eric Thames Wednesday. But the Brewers still won -- a testament to their position-player depth -- and now those three will have a second straight day off today before they head out on a road tip that will include three games each against the Rockies and Dodgers, two of the top teams in the NL.\n\n\"Some guys are going to get a little break here as we head into the last quarter of the season,\" Counsell said. \"Obviously, (it's) a really important part of the season. Hopefully, it's a place where you can get their legs back under you and get a little fresher, if that's possible at this time of year.\"\n\nRight now, the Brewers are showing that almost anything is possible at this time of year.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri":

Milwaukee has won four straight, a winning streak preceded by a six-game losing streak.\n\nThe Brewers went into the All-Star break with a 5 1/2-game lead in the NL Central but has since gone 13-18 to slip a game behind the Chicago Cubs. Since the break, the Brewers are 4-11 on the road.\n\nThe Brewers and Rockies began the season at Miller Park, with Colorado winning three of four games. The Brewers are 12-13 against the NL West and 4-7 against the Rockies, Giants and Dodgers.\n\nThe Rockies have lost seven of their past 10 games overall but are 37-23 at home. The Dodgers, quite simply, are a juggernaut at a major-league-best 85-34. And while the disappointing Giants have the second-worst record in the NL, the Brewers are 22-36 all-time in San Francisco and last won a series there in 2010. So Milwaukee's trip won't be easy.\n\n\"There's a challenge every single night,\" Brewers manager Craig Counsell told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \"It's, 'Play a good game.' I think if we play a good game, we have a really good chance to win. That's how you look at it.\n\n\"The schedule is something totally out of our control. It's in front of us the next day. The schedule says, 'Be here. This is who you're facing.' That's how you have to treat it.\"\n\nGarza is 2-5 with a 6.10 ERA in seven career starts against the Rockies and 0-3 with an 8.82 ERA in three starts at Coors Field.\n\nThe Brewers are 9-9 in games started this year by Garza, who won his last start 7-4 Sunday against Cincinnati while giving up five hits, five walks and four runs (three earned) in 5 1/3 innings. Garza has not pitched six innings in any of his past six starts.\n\nMarquez's four-game winning streak ended Sunday at Miami, where he allowed seven hits and five runs in 4 1/3 innings as the Rockies fell 5-3. Colorado is 12-8 in starts by Marquez, who is 5-0 with a 2.72 ERA in his past seven starts at Coors Field and 0-0 with a 3.00 ERA in one start against Milwaukee last year.\n\nRockies first baseman Mark Reynolds will be facing his former team this weekend.\n\nIn his one season with the Brewers in 2014, Reynolds hit just .196 with 22 homers and 45 RBIs in 130 games. However, the 34-year-old veteran has been a difference-maker this year in his second season with the Rockies.\n\nIn December, Colorado signed Ian Desmond to a five-year, $70 million contract to play first base. On Feb. 1, the Rockies signed Reynolds to a minor league contract, with the intent of having him provide right-handed power off the bench.\n\nHowever, Desmond opened the season on the disabled list with a broken left hand and is on the disabled list again with a right calf strain. He has played just 65 games, more in left field than at first base.\n\nReynolds, meanwhile, is hitting .280 with 25 homers, 80 RBIs and an .880 OPS in 113 games.\n\n\"The thing I'm most proud of is I took advantage of an opportunity,\" Reynolds said. \"I don't wish ill on anyone, but unfortunately Desi got hurt and I was able to kind of cement myself in the lineup.\n\n\"I remember I first talked to (manager) Buddy (Black) when I signed, and I told him, 'I know the situation. My main goal is to make it hard on you to take me out of the lineup.' And I'm really proud of myself that I was able to stay consistent and produce, and like I said, take advantage of the opportunity I was given.\"", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri":

Gerrit Cole certainly did not enjoy serving it up.\n\nThat's what happens, though, when a homer-happy club like the Milwaukee Brewers crosses paths with Cole, who's been a frequent victim of long balls this year.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Brewers mashed five home runs -- three of them off Cole -- and edged the Pirates, 7-6.\n\n\"I have a couple friends in this league. I don't look forward to facing or enjoy facing them,\" said Cole, who sent Walker a text message after the game. \"I'd rather just be friends, but ... you know, whatever.\"\n\nThe Pirates took a 6-5 lead in the eighth when Josh Bell tripled and scored on Adam Frazier's single.\n\nIn the bottom of the inning, reliever Juan Nicasio (1-5) gave up Jesus Aguilar's infield single and Manny Pina's decisive two-run homer.\n\nIn six innings, Cole gave up four runs on five hits and struck out nine. He wasted an early four-run lead.\n\n\"It's frustrating to get spotted that and not be able to hold it,\" Cole said. \"That's the sour taste in my mouth right now. My pitch execution today was pretty good, but ... we wanted to win this one bad.\"\n\nPoor pitch location led to Walker's home run. That was not the case, Cole said, on the solo blasts by Keon Broxton and Travis Shaw.\n\n\"They were right where we wanted,\" Cole said.\n\nCole has allowed multiple home runs in six of his 25 starts this season. That includes three three-homer games -- all of them coming over his past 15 appearances.\n\nOverall, Cole has allowed 26 homers, the third-highest total in the majors. The Pirates' single-season record is 32, set by Murry Dickson in 1951.\n\nThe Brewers went into the game with 172 homers, tied with the Los Angeles Dodgers for sixth-most in the majors. By the end of the day, Milwaukee had climbed to fourth place.\n\n\"That's how this team was built, with the ability to hit those deep fly balls,\" Walker said.\n\nThe Pirates were ahead 4-0 after three innings, 5-4 in the seventh, and 6-5 in the eighth.\n\n\"We kept coming, and they kept coming back,\" manager Clint Hurdle said. \"We did a lot of nice things. Everything except win the game.\"\n\nWith two outs in the third, the Pirates put five straight batters on base and built a 4-0 lead.\n\nIn the bottom of the inning, Broxton launched Cole's first pitch over the wall in right-center.\n\n\"I was looking for a fastball middle-away early,\" Broxton said. \"Cole is a great pitcher, so you've got to jump on him early. You've got to jump on his mistakes, and I think he left that one more middle than middle away. I got good wood to it, and it took off.\"\n\nWith one out, Eric Sogard walked. Walker hammered a changeup.\n\n\"It was a mistake,\" Cole said. \"That's the one I want back.\"\n\nWalker was looking for something out over the plate.\n\n\"He'd been painting the outer corner for most of the game,\" Walker said. \"And he left the changeup up in the zone enough for me to pull it.\"\n\nAfter Josh Harrison's RBI single put the Pirates up 5-4, George Kontos replaced Cole to start the seventh. Since joining the Pirates on Aug. 5, Kontos had retired all 24 batters he had faced.\n\nBroxton snapped Kontos' streak with a home run to left-center, his 19th of the year. He also leads the majors with 143 strikeouts.\n\n\"I think my power's always been there,\" Broxton said. \"I developed over the past two years to get the backspin and, really, just to get the barrel to the ball.\"\n\nOver two seasons (260 games) in the Pirates' farm system, Broxton went deep 25 times. Yet, he wasn't going to get regular playing time in the majors as long as the Pirates had Andrew McCutchen, Starling Marte and Gregory Polanco.\n\nAfter Broxton went hitless in seven games (two at-bats) for the Pirates in 2015, he was traded to the Brewers for Jason Rogers. Seven weeks ago, Rogers was released from Triple-A Indianapolis so he could play in Japan.\n\n\"Anytime you do something good against a former team, it feels good,\" Broxton said. \"It feels good to let them know what they're missing out on.\"\n\nRob Biertempfel is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

It has the feel of a make-or-break trip for the Brewers, who have defied expectations by remaining in the NL Central race at this late stage.\n\nOf the top three teams in the division - Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Louis - it's by far the toughest schedule over the next 10 days. The Cubs will play a home series against Toronto, then visit two last-place clubs, Cincinnati and Philadelphia. The Cardinals play four games in Pittsburgh, then return home to play San Diego and Tampa Bay.\n\nMLB: Live scoreboard | Standings | Brewers schedule\n\nDoesn't seem fair to the Brewers, does it? Well, the schedule is the schedule, and teams basically play the same opponents over the course of the season, with minimal variance in interleague competition.\n\n\"There's a challenge every single night,\" Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. \"It's 'play a good game.' I think if we play a good game, we have a really good chance to win. That's how you look at it.\n\n\"The schedule is something totally out of our control. It's in front of us the next day. The schedule says, 'Be here. This is who you're facing.' That's how you have to treat it.\"\n\nColorado was not projected to be a playoff team by most prognosticators before the season began, but it got off to a strong start behind improved pitching and have held a wild-card position for most of the season in a division in which the Dodgers ran away long ago.\n\nThanks to a recent swoon by Arizona, the Rockies moved a game ahead of the Diamondbacks into the first wild-card position entering play Thursday. There's a lot riding on who finishes with the best record because that team gets to play at home in the winner-take-all, wild-card shootout.\n\nWith the second-worst record in the NL, San Francisco qualifies as the most disappointing team in 2017. The Giants were expected to be a playoff contender but fell out of the race early and never recovered. But the Brewers traditionally have fared poorly in San Francisco (22-36 all time), last winning a series there in 2010.\n\nWhich brings us to the Dodgers, who are having a ridiculous season, particularly at home. With yet another walk-off victory Wednesday night against the Chicago White Sox, they moved an incredible 51 games above .500 (85-34) with a 51-14 record at home and a hard-to-fathom 50 wins in their last 59 games.\n\n\"Every trip is important; every game is important,\" said Ryan Braun, who has been on his hottest binge of the season with a .486 batting average over his last nine games. \"It's easy to look at and say it's going to be tough.\n\n\"Playing Colorado in Colorado is tough. I couldn't care less what San Francisco's record is. That's a good team with good players. And the Dodgers have been the best team in baseball. So, yeah, that will be tough.\n\n\"But every game is of equal importance and significance, all season, but especially when you get to this point. Now, there are four teams in it, so we're bunched up. So, every game is of the utmost importance. The closer we get to the finish, the less room for error.\"\n\n#Brewers pitcher Jimmy Nelson talks about huge upcoming trip to Colorado, San Francisco and LA. pic.twitter.com/MNH74J7ozV -- Tom (@Haudricourt)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nThe Brewers realize the trip could be crucial in terms of their playoff chances. The last time they embarked on a three-city trip to Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Washington, coming out of the all-star break, they took a massive pratfall, going 2-8.\n\nThat woeful trip was the beginning of a four-week slide for the Brewers, who saw their 5 1/2-game lead in the division quickly melt away. They stopped hitting as a team and lost 18 of 27 games coming out of the break.\n\nThe offense finally showed signs of life in the last five games, scoring 33 runs. They are hitting home runs again - their key to success - and take a four-game winning streak to Colorado.\n\n\"You're going to go through things like this,\" Braun said. \"It's the ebb and flow of the season, individually and as a team. You go through periods where it goes really well and other periods where it doesn't go well. It seems like people pay more attention to it when it happens in August and September.\n\n\"We probably weren't as good as our early record was but obviously we're not close to as bad as we've been for the last three weeks. Overall, I think we're slightly better than our record but not a lot. So, we're close to where we should be, which is a good place to be.\n\nLike Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Sports on Facebook for the latest Wisconsin sports updates right in your news feed.Visit JS Sports on FacebookLike Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Sports on Facebook for the latest Wisconsin sports updates right in your news feed.Visit on Facebook\n\n\"We're still in this thing. We just continue to compete and hope for the best. Nobody saw this coming, so we're in a good place, with opportunity ahead of us. We're excited about it. Hopefully, we're getting back to playing good baseball.\"\n\nThe good news for the Brewers is they are getting two key players back at the outset of the trip. Right-hander Chase Anderson, out since June 29 with a left oblique strain, will return to the rotation Sunday against the Rockies. Catcher Stephen Vogt, sidelined since July 18 with a sprained left knee, should rejoin the club in Denver as well after finishing a rehab stint with Class AAA Colorado Springs.\n\nWith the roster already fortified by the trade for veteran second baseman Neil Walker, the Brewers will feature their best depth of the season as they enter the stretch run for the playoffs.\n\n\"We have impactful players on the way back,\" Braun said. \"And the guys we're going to bring up in September are really good players, so they will help.\n\n\"There are real reasons for hope. The most important thing is where you're at as a team, which is a good place for us. If we play good for six weeks, we could end up getting into the postseason, which is something nobody thought we'd have a chance to do.\"\n\nUpcoming schedules for NL leaders\n\nAug. 18-27\n\nCubs: Toronto (3 games), at Cincinnati (3), at Philadelphia (3).\n\nBrewers: At Colorado (3), at San Francisco (3), at Los Angeles Dodgers (3).\n\nCardinals: At Pittsburgh (3), San Diego (3), Tampa Bay

For any baseball fan, watching the NL Central action on Wednesday most certainly didn't disappoint in terms of the entertainment factor, either. Between the five -- with the Boston Red Sox mixed in, as someone outside the division had to play one of the five Central teams -- we saw just about everything.\n\nLet's run through it as best we can.\n\nMilwaukee Brewers homer their way back in see-saw battle\n\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates got out to a 4-0 lead through the top of the third inning in Milwaukee, but the Brewers cut it to 4-3 with a pair of homers in the bottom of the third, including new acquisition Neil Walker hitting a two-run shot. Travis Shaw would tie things up with a home run in the sixth.\n\nThen, the Pirates scored in the seventh and Keon Broxton hit his second homer of the game to tie it. Then, the Pirates scored in the eighth and Manny Pina hit a two-run shot for the Brewers to take the lead for good in the bottom of the eighth.\n\nYes, the Brewers hit five home runs, most of them could be filed in the \"clutch\" category, too. Here is Pina's shot:\n\nHere's the homer that earned Manny Pi\u00f1a a postgame shower on the field! #ThisIsMyCrew#MILvsPITpic.twitter.com/kpj0HsR4Uq -- Milwaukee Brewers (@Brewers)\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\nWith it being a day game, the Brewers and their fans could turn to watching the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals at night and, boy was the night action a doozy.\n\nCardinals grab early lead, but ...\n\nThe Cardinals had a 4-0 lead in the second inning after stringing together a series of hits and it appeared it would be 5-0 on a one-out single to center with a runner on third. Only Matt Carpenter was thrown out at home by Jackie Bradley Jr. Yes, from third on a single to center.\n\nTest JBJ.\n\nWe dare you. pic.twitter.com/RAhxQhVHOM -- Red Sox (@RedSox)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nObviously the circumstances there made it so. It was hit hard, was close to being a lineout with fewer than two outs -- so Carpenter had to hang in case he was going to tag up -- and an amazing throw had to be made.\n\nIt would turn out to be an ominous precursor.\n\nCubs grab big lead\n\nFirst, John Lackey got into trouble in the first inning. The Cincinnati Reds loaded the bases with no outs. After a sac fly scored one, the Cubs were able to get a double play via Kyle Schwarber throwing out his second runner at home plate in the past few days.\n\nIn the bottom half, the Cubs also loaded the bases with no outs themselves. The Reds wouldn't be as fortunate:\n\n.@ARizzo44 with the oppo SLAM ... and the bullpen is lovin' it. https://t.co/97xICLLC3D#PapaSlampic.twitter.com/JZhV6XxhAX -- MLB (@MLB)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nThe grand slam was Anthony Rizzo 's 28th homer of the season.\n\nLackey stole a base on the pitcher (what?!?)\n\nThe Cubs would tack on two more for a 6-1 lead heading into the late innings. In the meantime, 38-year-old pitcher Lackey singled, stole the first base of his career and then he got a bit too nuts and was picked off on a walk with the meat of the Cubs' order coming up.\n\nHere's the steal:\n\nI wanna go fast! pic.twitter.com/cS8xPcBtlz -- MLB (@MLB)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nThings would only get more crazy.\n\nMatheny ejected in Boston\n\nBack to Fenway Park, where the Cardinals were now clinging to a 4-3 lead in the bottom of the ninth. There were two runners on base and manager Mike Matheny had already been barking at the umpires for a while regarding the strike zone and a checked-swing call during Bradley's walk.\n\nThen, with an 0-2 count, pitcher John Brebbia was taking an inordinately long amount of time to pitch the ball and time was granted. Or was it? It actually doesn't look like Red Sox hitter Eduardo Nunez called time and instead home-plate umpire Chris Segel decided to call time on his own. Catcher Yadier Molina would know and he reacted angrily. Matheny then went nuts and got tossed:\n\nBrebbia would retire Nunez, but the next batter was Mookie Betts and this happened:\n\nAnother gut punch of a loss for the Cardinals.\n\nMeanwhile, in Wrigley ...\n\nAt about the same time all this was happening, the Reds got a solo shot from rookie Phillip Ervin (his first career hit, in fact) and a two-run homer from Zack Cozart to make things interesting. They'd get even more interesting when Adam Duvall tied the game with a pinch-hit, two-run homer in the eighth.\n\nCircling back to the Brewers. Were they about to see the Cardinals blow a 4-0 lead on the same night the Cubs lost after a 6-1 lead on the same day the Brewers came back to win after a 4-0 deficit? Well, first there was another ejection\n\nMaddon tossed\n\nJavier Baez would double to start off the bottom of the ninth for the Cubs with Jon Jay drawing a walk to set up an obvious bunt situation for Ben Zobrist . He was hit by a pitch, but the umpiring crew ruled that he offered.\n\nThat's such a tough one to judge intent. The bat head did drop, but it seemed like it was possible the bat head would naturally drop when the body contorts to get out of the way. Of course Maddon thinks it was obvious Zobrist didn't offer, just like the Reds (and Cardinals, Brewers and Pirates for that matter) probably would say it's obvious Zobrist did offer.\n\nStill, it's funny that both Matheny and Maddon went ballistic in the bottom of the ninth in weird situations on the same night.\n\nZobrist would weakly tap out, so the Cubs essentially got their \"bunt,\" moving the runners to second and third. Albert Almora would strike out, setting up 2016 NL MVP Kris Bryant in the spot to be clutch.\n\nThe walk-off ... what?\n\nThe first pitch to Bryant would end the game.\n\nA walk-off wild pitch was pretty much the perfect way to conclude the day of action in MLB's worst and most fun division.\n\nHow things stand\n\nHere's a look at the four contenders for the NL Central title and how the SportsLine projections show things right now:\n\nTeamRecordGames backChances to win division\n\nCubs\n\n63-56\n\n-\n\n53.6 percent\n\nBrewers\n\n63-59\n\n1 1/2\n\n15.6 percent\n\nCardinals\n\n61-59\n\n2 1/2\n\n25.5 percent\n\nPirates\n\n58-62\n\n5 1/2\n\n5.1 percent\n\nThe Cubs host the Reds at 2:20 p.m. ET Thursday before hosting the Toronto Blue Jays for a three-game series this weekend.

With a single, hit by pitch and walk, Shaw improved to 11-for-14 with two walks in the one-sided matchup of former American League East foes. He scored the Brewers' first two runs on the way to their third straight victory.\n\n\"I knew it was coming,\" Shaw said of the matchup. \"When I went down the other day, I knew I was going to be ready to go today pretty much no matter what happened. Thankfully, my leg healed enough to play.\"\n\nHis leg was still hurting from a fifth-inning at-bat on Saturday, when Shaw fouled one pitch off his right foot and another just below his right knee on the way to a strikeout. He later exited that game and left Miller Park in a walking boot, missing Sunday's series finale against the Reds.\n\nThe Brewers were off Monday, but Shaw was at Miller Park getting treatment so he could be ready to face Nova and the Pirates.\n\nAsked to explain his success against such a quality pitcher, Shaw said. \"I'm not sure. He's tough on righties; sinker, pretty good curveball. I just see the ball well off of him, and I seem to handle every pitch.\"\n\nShaw and Brewers starter Zach Davies both wondered whether Nova's frustration took over in the fourth inning, when Nova hit Shaw with a high and tight fastball with one out and the bases empty. Shaw called it \"kind of interesting.\"\n\n\"I don't know, man. Today, I feel bad for the guy. I tried to go inside and I hit the guy,\" Nova said. \"Maybe some people think it was intentional, but I'm not that kind of pitcher. I got him with the first pitch, but what can I do? He's a tough out. Nothing would make me feel better than getting the guy out. I can tell you that, for sure.\"\n\nShaw won another battle in the sixth, taking an eight-pitch walk.\n\n\"It's certainly something you don't see a lot,\" Brewers manager Craig Counsell said. \"Speaking for this year, [Shaw] been incredibly productive against him. He's earned it. The walk in the sixth inning, that was a great at-bat. He laid off some tough sinkers and fouled off a couple of curveballs. He's obviously seeing the ball well off Nova. You see it sometimes, but it rarely continues like Travis is making it continue.\"\n\nDavies can relate. He has trouble with the Cardinals' Jedd Gyorko, who is 10-for-16 lifetime against Davies. Twelve of those hits are singles, and only the homer produced a run, but every at-bat, Davies said, feels like a grind.\n\n\"It can kind of frustrate you,\" he said. \"But that's just the way baseball goes.\"", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora_and_Fauna", "wgt": 100, "id": 93, "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora and Fauna"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100, "id": 223, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 100, "id": 395, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "wgt": 100, "id": 704, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303569", "label": {"eng": "Handedness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303571", "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305018", "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305020", "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "310507", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310537", "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310548", "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311917", "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "314182", "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314218", "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "319493", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curveball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "327953", "label": {"eng": "Curveball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iv\u00e1n_Nova", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "334563", "label": {"eng": "Iv\u00e1n Nova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_by_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "339036", "label": {"eng": "Hit by pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinker_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "341844", "label": {"eng": "Sinker (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedd_Gyorko", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "368212", "label": {"eng": "Jedd Gyorko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_Park_(Milwaukee)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "442431", "label": {"eng": "Miller Park (Milwaukee)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Counsell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "442432", "label": {"eng": "Craig Counsell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Davies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1287677", "label": {"eng": "Zach Davies"}}]}

The home team has won each one.\n\nThat's not good news for the Pirates, who are in an offensive rut -- they've scored a total of four runs on 18 hits over the past three games, all losses. They haven't scored more than one run in an inning since Friday, when they got four runs (their entire output for the game) in the third inning against Blue Jays right Marcus Stroman. Not much as happened in 33 innings since then.\n\n\"The injuries play into it,\" manager Clint Hurdle said during this morning's media scrum. \"However, we've had opportunities to score. We don't have much of a safety net to play with; we haven't had one all year, even with (Gregory) Polanco or (Francisco) Cervelli in the lineup.\n\n\"The game we play, the kind of power we have, we need to move runners from second with no outs, we need to score runners from third with (fewer) than two outs, we need to play 27 outs on defense -- it's all tied together.\n\n\"We had a big game in Detroit (on Friday). We have not regained that traction. Today's an opportunity to do it.\"\n\nOverall this season, the Pirates are 51-11 when they score four-plus runs in a game and 7-50 when they score three or fewer runs.\n\nCERVELLI ON MEND\n\nHurdle was asked about Cervelli's status. \"Ill use the word improving,\" Hurdle said. \"He went to hit in the cage (this morning), so I'll have more information as the day goes on.\"\n\nCHAMBERS HONORED\n\nPirates minor leaguer Evan Chambers, who died in his sleep in December 2013, was selected for the High-A Florida State League hall of fame. He will be the first former Brandenton player enshrined.\n\nA third-round pick in 2009, Chambers batted .222 with a .713 OPS in 186 games with Bradenton. A center fielder, Chambers was promoted to Double-A Altoona in 2012. Bradenton retired his No. 53 in 2014.\n\nTODAY'S GAME\n\n2:10 p.m. at Miller Park, Milwaukee. TV: AT&T Sportsnet.

The fighting in el-Fasher, the provincial capital of North Darfur province, also wounded more than 930 people in the same period, Doctors without Borders said. \u201cThis is a sign of the violent intensity of the fighting,\u201d the group said. \u201cWe urge the warring parties to do more to protect civilians.\u201d Clashes between the military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces escalated earlier this month in the city, forcing thousands of people to flee their homes, according to the United Nations. El-Fasher has become the center of the conflict between the military and the RSF, which is aided by Arab militias commonly known as janjaweed. The city is the last stronghold that is still held by the military in the sprawling Darfur region. Sudan\u2019s conflict began in April last year when soaring tensions between the leaders of the military and the RSF exploded into open fighting in the capital, Khartoum, and elsewhere in the country. The conflict killed more than 14,000 people and wounded thousands more amid reports of widespread sexual violence and other atrocities that rights groups say amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. It also pushed the country\u2019s population to the brink of famine. The U.N. food agency warned the warring parties earlier this month that there is a serious risk of widespread starvation and death in Darfur and elsewhere in Sudan if they don\u2019t allow humanitarian aid into the vast western region. The RSF has built up forces in recent months seeking to wres control of el-Fasher. Along with its Arab militia allies, the RSF besieged the city and launched a major attack on its southern and eastern parts earlier this month. The clashes renewed on Thursday in the Abu Shouk camp for displaced people in the Salam neighborhood in the city\u2019s northern part, as well as its southern western parts, the U.N.\u2019s International Organization for Migration reported. On Saturday, a shell hit the house of a Doctors Without Borders aid worker close to the city\u2019s main market, killing the worker, the charity said.", "summary": "BY SAMY MAGDY (Associated Press) CAIRO (AP) &#8212; More than two weeks of fighting between Sudan&#8217;s military and a notorious paramilitary group over a major city in the western Darfur region killed at least 123 people, an international aid group said Sunday.

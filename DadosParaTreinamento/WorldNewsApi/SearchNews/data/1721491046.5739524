Why not try this low-impact five-move walking workout to reduce tight hips, boost flexibility and build a stronger body? Forget under-desk treadmills or the best treadmills for running and walking, you only need your body weight and a spare 30 minutes. Besides, if your goal is to build mental strength, why not get outdoors and into nature? Below, we cover how to do the walking workout, alternatives you can try and the benefits of walking for cardiovascular and muscular health. Here\u2019s everything you need to know. What are the benefits of a walking workout? Although a gentle walk can be relaxing and enjoyable or more intense and raise your heart rate (we hit the research to discover the difference between hiking versus power walking for calorie burn), have you thought about what walking could do for stiff hips and lower body strength? Research, published in the journal Biomedicine, tells us that some back pain can be attributed to tight muscles surrounding the spine and pelvis, including the glutes, hips and hamstrings. With that in mind, if you have a job that requires plenty of sitting, you might find that stretching your hip flexors regularly, strengthening your lower body and moving more throughout the day \u2014 a little trick called NEAT \u2014 could improve the quality of movement during daily tasks and exercise, boost metabolism and even improve mood. Build resilient hips, hamstrings, glutes, quads, calves and core muscles with these five exercises and a short beginner-friendly walking workout. What is the 5-move walking workout without weights? If you\u2019re using a treadmill, you can easily adjust the incline and decline settings accordingly, and if you prefer to work outdoors, find a hill, staircase, or similar. Set a rolling 30-minute timer, then perform each exercise for 45 seconds and gently walk or jog on flat ground or an incline for 15 seconds between. Complete the 5 exercises, which equals 1 round, then repeat for 6 rounds, totaling 30 minutes. By the end of the workout, your leg muscles should feel pretty cooked and your hips and glutes stretched and lengthened. Remember to warm up with gentle movement and lower body mobility exercises to help warm the muscles and send fresh blood flow and oxygen around the body. The session is low-impact and combines walking, lunging and stretching, but you could add some light dumbbells, ankle weights, or a weighted vest to increase the intensity. Incline walking lungesThe World\u2019s Greatest StretchSkater steps (jog or walk)Step-up to reverse lungeIncline side lunges 1. Incline walking lunges Walking lunges torch the lower body muscles, especially if you choose an incline. Make sure to lower your back knee to the ground to reach proper depth without hitting your knee against the ground. Start at the bottom of a hill, slope, or staircaseTake a large step forward with your right foot, landing your entire foot on the groundKeep your torso upright and core engaged. You can raise your arms overhead to help engage your upper body, hold weights, or place your hands on your hipsLower your left knee toward the ground into a lunge, keeping the weight distributed between your front foot and the ball of your back footSlightly lean forward to help engage your glutesDrive upward to stand as you step forward with your left leg and repeat on the other side 2. The World's Greatest Stretch (WGS) The humbly named \"World's Greatest Stretch\" mobilizes the entire body and stretches the hip flexors, glutes and legs. Lift your back leg to engage the quad, or lower the knee to the floor for extra support. Start on flat ground in a low lunge with your left leg forward and right knee resting on the groundTuck the toes of the right foot and lift the back leg if you prefer, keeping the leg straight and quad engagedAs you inhale, lift your left arm upward and gently twist toward your left legAs you exhale, draw your left elbow downward to tap your left ankle. You could also sweep your left arm across the body to the right sideRepeat for several reps, then switch sides. 3. Skater steps Skater steps increase cardiovascular effort and test balance, stability and coordination while working your body unilaterally. Moving between your right and left sides of the body with speed and power, especially on an incline, teaches the muscles to fire and recruit together, helping to engage your smaller, stabilizer muscles and the larger muscle groups like the glutes and quads. Use your arms to help drive the movement and squeeze your core muscles as you move. If you reach the top of your incline, jog back to the starting position and repeat. Using flat ground, a staircase, or a hill, step your left foot forward and to the left. If you\u2019re using a step, aim for the second step, or third if you have longer legsAllow your right leg to follow without your right foot touching the ground, then step your right foot over to the right a few steps upContinue climbing, stepping as far to each side as you can and taking several stairs at a timeOnce you feel comfortable, speed up.

Perform on flat ground first, then add an incline for a challenge.

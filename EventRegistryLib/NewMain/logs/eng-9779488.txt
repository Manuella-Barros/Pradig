So, while this is not necessarily a surprise given Bradley was named U.S. captain for the Ryder Cup, holding both a playing and coaching position simultaneously while still at a stage in his career where he can contend at significant events is fascinating.\n\nBy means of comparison, Kevin Durant ranked No. 21 in NBA win shares last season. Justin Herbert ranked No. 21 in NFL fantasy points scored. Jose Ramirez ranks No. 21 across the MLB in WAR this season. It's difficult to envision any of those three moving into a coaching role for a national team at this point in their careers.\n\nRegardless, Bradley is clearly fired up for the opportunity to not only lead the U.S. team at the Ryder Cup but prepare for that role this fall at the Presidents Cup. He last played at the Presidents Cup in 2013 and currently ranks No. 17 in the Presidents Cup standings.

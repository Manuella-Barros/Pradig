Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nGoogle almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may land in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nAs expected, Mehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\n\"Advertisers consistently testified that shifting significant ad spending from Google to Bing would be ineffective (and unwise) because of Bing's lack of scale,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\n\"The court confirmed what almost everyone in the industry already knew: that Google is a monopoly and is abusing its power to harm consumers and enrich itself,\" said Roger Alford, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out billions annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said eMarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google. Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives.\"\n\nRegardless she added, a drawn-out appeals process will delay any immediate effects for both consumers and advertisers.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.", "source": {"uri":

Will this boost Nvidia's $330 billion market cap? How soon will AI drive profits?\n\nWASHINGTON -- A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies.\n\nThe highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century.\n\nAfter reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote in his 277-page ruling.\n\nIt represents a major setback for Google and its parent, Alphabet Inc., which had steadfastly argued that its popularity stemmed from consumers' overwhelming desire to use a search engine so good at what it does that it has become synonymous with looking things up online. Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nGoogle almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may land in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nAs expected, Mehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\n\"Advertisers consistently testified that shifting significant ad spending from Google to Bing would be ineffective (and unwise) because of Bing's lack of scale,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\n\"The court confirmed what almost everyone in the industry already knew: that Google is a monopoly and is abusing its power to harm consumers and enrich itself,\" said Roger Alford, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out billions annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said eMarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google. Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives.\"\n\nRegardless she added, a drawn-out appeals process will delay any immediate effects for both consumers and advertisers.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.\n\nKids, screen time and

Mehta of US District Court for the District of Columbia said in a 277-page ruling that Google had abused a monopoly over the search business. The Justice Department and states had sued Google, accusing it of illegally cementing its dominance, in part, by paying other companies, such as Apple and Samsung, billions of dollars a year to have Google automatically handle search queries on their smartphones and web browsers.\n\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nThe ruling is a harsh verdict on the rise of giant technology companies that have used their roots in the internet to influence the way we shop, consume information and search online -- and indicates a potential limit of Big Tech's power. It is likely to influence other government antitrust lawsuits against Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The last significant antitrust ruling against a tech company targeted Microsoft more than two decades ago.\n\n\"This is the most important antitrust case of the century, and it's the first of a big slate of cases to come down against Big Tech,\" said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor at Vanderbilt University's law school who studies antitrust. \"It's a huge turning point.\"\n\nThe decision is a major blow to Google, which was built on its search engine and has become so closely associated with online search that its name has become a verb. The ruling could have major ramifications for Google's success, especially as the company spends heavily to compete in the race over artificial intelligence. Google faces another federal antitrust case over ad technology that is scheduled to go to trial next month.\n\nMonday's ruling did not include remedies for Google's behaviour. Mehta will now decide that, potentially forcing the company to change the way it runs or to sell off part of its business.\n\nMehta's ruling capped a yearslong case -- US et al v. Google -- that resulted in a 10-week trial last year. The Justice Department and states sued in 2020 over Google's dominance in online search, which generates billions in profits annually. The Justice Department said Googles search engine conducted nearly 90% of web searches, a number the company disputed.\n\nThe company spends billions of dollars annually to be the automatic search engine on browsers such as Apple's Safari and Mozilla's Firefox. Google paid Apple about US$18 billion for being the default in 2021, The New York Times has reported.\n\n\"This landmark decision holds Google accountable,\" Jonathan Kanter, the top Justice Department antitrust official, said in a statement. \"It paves the path for innovation for generations to come and protects access to information for all Americans.\"\n\nKent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said the company would appeal the ruling.\n\n\"This decision recognises that Google offers the best search engine but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" he said. \"As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use.\"\n\nDuring the trial, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified that he was concerned that his competitor's dominance had created a \"Google web\" and that its relationship with Apple was \"oligopolistic.\" If Google continued undeterred, it was likely to become dominant in the race to develop AI, he said.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai countered in his testimony that Google created a better service for consumers.\n\nUsers choose to search on Google because they find it useful, and the company has continued to invest to make it better, the company's lawyers said.\n\n\"Google is winning because it's better,\" John Schmidtlein, Google's lead courtroom lawyer, said during closing arguments, which were held months later, in May.\n\nThe government argued that by paying billions of dollars to be the automatic search engine on consumer devices, Google had denied its competitors the opportunity to build the scale required to compete with its search engine. Instead, Google collected more data about consumers that it used to make its search engine better and more dominant.\n\nMehta sided with the government, saying Google had a monopoly over general online search services. The company's agreements to be the automatic search engine on devices and web browsers hurt competition, making it harder for rivals to challenge Google's dominance.\n\nFor more than a decade, those agreements \"have given Google access to scale that its rivals cannot match,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nThe government also accused Google of protecting a monopoly over the ads that run inside search results. Government lawyers said Google had raised the price of ads beyond the rates that should exist in a free market, which they argued was a sign of the company's power. Search ads provide billions of dollars in annual revenue for Google.\n\nMehta ruled that Google's monopoly allowed it to inflate the prices for some search ads. That, in turn, gave the company more money to pay for its search engine to get prime placement, he said.\n\n\"Unconstrained price increases have fuelled Google's dramatic revenue growth and allowed it to maintain high and remarkably stable operating profits,\" he said in the ruling.\n\nMehta ruled in Google's favour on some lesser claims. Google offers advertisers many tools, including one that they use to manage advertising on different search engines. State attorneys general argued during the trial that Google had illegally excluded Microsoft's search engine, Bing, from aspects of those tools. But Mehta ruled against their claim.\n\nLegal scholars expect this decision to influence government antitrust lawsuits against the other tech giants. All of those investigations, conducted by the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, began during the Trump administration and have ramped up under President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Justice Department has sued Apple, arguing that the company made it difficult for consumers to ditch the iPhone, and brought the other case against Google. The FTC has separately sued Meta, claiming the company stamped out nascent competitors, and Amazon, accusing it of squeezing sellers on its online marketplace.\n\nWith those cases, the government is testing 100-year-old laws originally used to rein in utility and other monopolistic companies such as Standard Oil.\n\nA victory for the government provides credibility for its broader attempt to use antitrust laws to take aim at corporate America, said William Kovacic, a former chair of the FTC.\n\n\"It creates momentum that supports their other cases,\" he said in an interview in June.\n\nGoogle has also faced antitrust scrutiny in Europe, where officials charged the company last year with undermining rivals in online advertising.\n\nThe last major US court ruling on a tech antitrust case -- in the Justice Department's 1990s lawsuit against Microsoft -- cast its own shadow over the Google arguments. Mehta repeatedly pressed lawyers to explain how the specifics of the case against Google could fit into the legal precedents.\n\nThe Microsoft antitrust case alleged that the tech giant combined practices such as bullying industry partners and leveraging the popularity of its digital platform, from which users typically didn't switch, to stifle competition.\n\nA district court judge initially ruled against Microsoft on most counts of possible antitrust violations and ordered a breakup of the company, but an appeals court reversed some of those decisions.

Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nGoogle almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may land in the U..S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nAs expected, Mehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out billions annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices.

Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion.

Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said in a 277-page ruling that Google had abused a monopoly over the search business. The Justice Department and states had sued Google, accusing it of illegally cementing its dominance, in part, by paying other companies, like Apple and Samsung, billions of dollars a year to have Google automatically handle search queries on their smartphones and web browsers.\n\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Judge Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nThe ruling is a harsh verdict on the rise of giant technology companies that have used their roots in the internet to influence the way we shop, consume information and search online -- and indicates a potential limit of Big Tech's power. It is likely to influence other government antitrust lawsuits against Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The last significant antitrust ruling against a tech company targeted Microsoft more than two decades ago.\n\nThe decision is a major blow to Google, which had fiercely defended itself against the allegations. Internet search is a core driver of the company's profits, and the ruling could have major ramifications for its future success, especially as Google spends heavily to compete in the race over artificial intelligence.\n\nMonday's ruling did not include remedies for Google's behavior. Judge Mehta will now decide that, potentially forcing the company to change the way it runs or to sell off part of its business.\n\nJudge Mehta's ruling capped a yearslong case -- U.S. et al. v. Google -- that resulted in a 10-week trial last year. The Justice Department and states sued in 2020 over Google's dominance in online search, which generates billions in profits annually. The Justice Department said Google's search engine conducted nearly 90 percent of web searches, a number the company disputed.\n\nThe company spends billions of dollars annually to be the automatic search engine on browsers like Apple's Safari and Mozilla's Firefox. Google paid Apple about $18 billion for being the default in 2021, The New York Times has reported.\n\n\"This landmark decision holds Google accountable,\" Jonathan Kanter, the top Justice Department antitrust official, said in a statement. \"It paves the path for innovation for generations to come and protects access to information for all Americans.\"\n\nKent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said the company would appeal the ruling.\n\n\"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" he said. \"As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use.\"\n\nDuring the trial, Microsoft's chief executive, Satya Nadella, testified that he was concerned that his competitor's dominance had created a \"Google web\" and that its relationship with Apple was \"oligopolistic.\" If Google continued undeterred, it was likely to become dominant in the race to develop artificial intelligence, he said.\n\nGoogle's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, countered in his testimony that Google created a better service for consumers.\n\nUsers choose to search on Google because they find it useful, and the company has continued to invest to make it better, the company's lawyers said.\n\n\"Google is winning because it's better,\" John Schmidtlein, Google's lead courtroom lawyer, said during closing arguments, which were held months later in May.\n\nThe government argued that by paying billions of dollars to be the automatic search engine on consumer devices, Google had denied its competitors the opportunity to build the scale required to compete with its search engine. Instead, Google collected more data about consumers that it used to make its search engine better and more dominant.\n\nJudge Mehta sided with the government, saying Google had a monopoly over general online search services. The company's agreements to be the automatic search engine on devices and web browsers hurt competition, making it harder for rivals to challenge Google's dominance.\n\nFor more than a decade, those agreements \"have given Google access to scale that its rivals cannot match,\" Judge Mehta wrote.\n\nThe government also accused Google of protecting a monopoly over the ads that run inside search results. Government lawyers said Google had raised the price of ads beyond the rates that should exist in a free market, which they argued was a sign of the company's power. Search ads provide billions of dollars in annual revenue for Google.\n\nJudge Mehta ruled that Google's monopoly allowed it to inflate the prices for some search ads. That, in turn, gave the company more money to pay for its search engine to get prime placement, he said.\n\n\"Unconstrained price increases have fueled Google's dramatic revenue growth and allowed it to maintain high and remarkably stable operating profits,\" he said in the ruling.\n\nJudge Mehta ruled in Google's favor on some lesser claims. Google offers advertisers many tools, including one that they use to manage advertising on different search engines. State attorneys general argued during the trial that Google had illegally excluded Microsoft's search engine, Bing, from aspects of those tools. But Judge Mehta ruled against their claim.\n\nLegal scholars expect this decision to help set precedent for government antitrust lawsuits against the other tech giants. All of those investigations, conducted by the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, began during the Trump administration and have ramped up under President Biden.\n\nThe Justice Department has sued Apple, arguing that the company made it difficult for consumers to ditch the iPhone, and brought another case against Google -- focused on its advertising technology -- that is set to go to trial in September. The F.T.C. has separately sued Meta, claiming the company stamped out nascent competitors, and Amazon, accusing it of squeezing sellers on its online marketplace.\n\n\"It's a very prominent test of the Biden administration's new antitrust enforcement agenda,\" said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor at Vanderbilt University's law school.\n\nWith those cases, the government is testing hundred-year-old laws originally used to rein in utility and other monopolistic companies like Standard Oil.\n\nA victory for the government provides credibility for its broader attempt to use antitrust laws to take aim at corporate America, said William Kovacic, a former chairman of the F.T.C.\n\n\"It creates momentum that supports their other cases,\" he said in an interview in June.\n\nGoogle has also faced antitrust scrutiny in Europe, where officials charged the company last year with undermining rivals in online advertising.\n\nThe last major U.S. court ruling on a tech antitrust case -- in the Justice Department's 1990s lawsuit against Microsoft -- cast its own shadow over the Google arguments. Judge Mehta repeatedly pressed lawyers to explain how the specifics of the case against Google could fit into the legal precedents.\n\nThe Microsoft antitrust case alleged that the tech giant combined practices like bullying industry partners and leveraging the popularity of its digital platform, from which users typically didn't switch, to stifle competition.\n\nA District Court judge initially ruled against Microsoft on most counts of possible antitrust violations and ordered a breakup of the company, but an appeals court reversed some of those decisions.

The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centrepiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $US240 billion ($A370 billion) in revenue last year.\n\nUS Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine - a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nAs expected, Mehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new mobile phones and tech gadgets.\n\nIn 2021 alone, Google spent more than $US26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting.\n\nFor instance, Yahoo was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings.\n\nHe noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80 per cent share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser.\n\nThe judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognised as the best (general search engine) available in the United States\".\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out billions annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices.\n\nAfter the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails", "source": {"uri": "thewest.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The West Australian"},

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled Monday, Aug. 5, 2024, that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies.\n\nThe highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century.\n\nAfter reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote in his 277-page ruling.\n\nIt represents a major setback for Google and its parent, Alphabet Inc., which had steadfastly argued that its popularity stemmed from consumers' overwhelming desire to use a search engine so good at what it does that it has become synonymous with looking things up online. Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nGoogle almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may land in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nAs expected, Mehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\n\"Advertisers consistently testified that shifting significant ad spending from Google to Bing would be ineffective (and unwise) because of Bing's lack of scale,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\n\"The court confirmed what almost everyone in the industry already knew: that Google is a monopoly and is abusing its power to harm consumers and enrich itself,\" said Roger Alford, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out billions annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said eMarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google. Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives.\"\n\nRegardless she added, a drawn-out appeals process will delay any immediate effects for both consumers and advertisers.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.", "source": {"uri":

That lengthy process will enable Google to fend off the likelihood of Mehta banning default search agreements, Hay said, but it probably won't shield the company from class-action lawsuits citing the judge's findings that advertisers were gouged with monopolistic pricing.\n\nIf Mehta decides to limit or ban Google's default search deals, it could squeeze Apple's profits, too. Although parts of his decision were redacted to protect confidential business information, Mehta noted that Google paid Apple an estimated $20 billion in 2022, doubling from 2020. The judge also noted Apple has periodically considered building its own search technology, but backed off that after a 2018 analysis estimated the company would lose more than $12 billion in revenue during the first five years after a break-up with Google.\n\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the US and abroad.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan, File)WASHINGTON (AP) - A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May. \"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote in his 277-page ruling. It represents a major setback for Google and its parent, Alphabet Inc., which had steadfastly argued that its popularity stemmed from consumers' overwhelming desire to use a search engine so good at what it does that it has become synonymous with looking things up online. Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND. Google almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may land in the U.S. Supreme Court. For now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration. \"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\"\u009d said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company - no matter how large or influential - is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\u009d The case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine - a lax approach that hurt consumers. As expected, Mehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling. Google ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo - now a minor player on the internet - was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along. Mehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option. \"Advertisers consistently testified that shifting significant ad spending from Google to Bing would be ineffective (and unwise) because of Bing's lack of scale,\"\u009d Mehta wrote. Still, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\u009d Mehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape. \"The court confirmed what almost everyone in the industry already knew: that Google is a monopoly and is abusing its power to harm consumers and enrich itself,\"\u009d said Roger Alford, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame. The potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out billions annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field. \"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal - depending on the remedy,\"\u009d said eMarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google. Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives.\"\u009d Regardless she added, a drawn-out appeals process will delay any immediate effects for both consumers and advertisers. If there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition. That Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion. Besides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009. \"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\"\u009d Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\u009d Nadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search. \"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\"\u009d Nadella said on the stand. Google faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.", "source": {"uri":

He said Google's dominance in the search market is evidence of its monopoly.\n\nGoogle \"enjoys an 89.2% share of the market for general search services, which increases to 94.9% on mobile devices,\" the ruling said.\n\nIt represents a major setback for Google and its parent, Alphabet Inc., which had steadfastly argued that its popularity stemmed from consumers' overwhelming desire to use a search engine so good at what it does that it has become synonymous with looking things up online. Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nKent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said the company intends to appeal Mehta's findings. \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Walker said.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nAs expected, Mehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets.

For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nThe Consumer Choice Center, a lobbying group that has fought other attempts to rein in businesses, decried Mehta's decision as a step in the wrong direction. \"The United States is drifting toward the anti-tech posture of the European Union, a part of the world that makes almost nothing and penalizes successful American companies for their popularity,\" said Yael Ossowski, the center's deputy director.\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out billions annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices.

Although parts of his decision were redacted to protect confidential business information, Mehta noted that Google paid Apple an estimated $20 billion in 2022, doubling from 2020. The judge also noted Apple has periodically considered building its own search technology, but backed off that after a 2018 analysis estimated the company would lose more than $12 billion in revenue during the first five years after a break-up with Google.\n\nGoogle's payments have helped Apple's steadily growing services division, which generated $85 billion in revenue during the company's last fiscal year. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Justice Department's antitrust division has recently taken on some of the biggest companies in the world. It sued Apple in March and in May announced a sweeping lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its owner, Live Nation Entertainment. Antitrust enforcers have also opened investigations into the roles Microsoft, Nvidia and OpenAI have played in the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nThe Biden administration has won some big cases, including blocking mergers of some of the world's biggest publishers as well as JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines. It's also had some notable setbacks, including in the sugar and healthcare industries.\n\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.\n\n-- --\n\nAssociated

He said Google's dominance in the search market is evidence of its monopoly.\n\nGoogle \"enjoys an 89.2% share of the market for general search services, which increases to 94.9% on mobile devices,\" the ruling said.\n\nIt represents a major setback for Google and its parent, Alphabet Inc., which had steadfastly argued that its popularity stemmed from consumers' overwhelming desire to use a search engine so good at what it does that it has become synonymous with looking things up online. Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nKent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said the company intends to appeal Mehta's findings: \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available.\"\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nMehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nThe Consumer Choice Center, a lobbying group that has fought other attempts to rein in businesses, decried Mehta's decision as a step in the wrong direction. \"The United States is drifting toward the anti-tech posture of the European Union, a part of the world that makes almost nothing and penalizes successful American companies for their popularity,\" said Yael Ossowski, the center's deputy director.\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from paying to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other devices. Or, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google. Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives.\"\n\nRegardless she added, a drawn-out appeals process will delay any immediate effects for both consumers and advertisers.\n\nLee Hepner, senior legal counsel for the American Economic Liberties Project, believes the tenor of Mehta's ruling makes it likely the judge will decide to prohibit Google from making default search deals and may even look at separating some of its different lines of business.\n\nThe appeals process could take as long as five years, predicted George Hay, a law professor at Cornell University who was the chief economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division for most of the 1970s. That lengthy process will enable Google to fend off the likelihood of Mehta banning default search agreements, Hay said, but it probably won't shield the company from class-action lawsuits citing the judge's findings that advertisers were gouged with monopolistic pricing.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nIf Mehta decides to limit or ban Google's default search deals, it could squeeze Apple's profits, too. Although parts of his decision were redacted to protect confidential business information, Mehta noted that Google paid Apple an estimated $20 billion in 2022, doubling from 2020. The judge also noted Apple has periodically considered building its own search technology, but backed off that after a 2018 analysis estimated the company would lose more than $12 billion in revenue during the first five years after a break-up with Google.\n\nGoogle's payments have helped Apple's steadily growing services division, which generated $85 billion in revenue during the company's last fiscal year. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Justice Department's antitrust division has recently taken on some of the biggest companies in the world. It sued Apple in March and in May announced a sweeping lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its owner, Live Nation Entertainment. Antitrust enforcers have also opened investigations into the roles Microsoft, Nvidia and OpenAI have played in the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nThe Biden administration has won some big cases, including blocking mergers of some of the world's biggest publishers as well as JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines. It's also had some notable setbacks, including in the sugar and healthcare industries.\n\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly. -- WASHINGTON (AP)\n\n_______\n\nStory by MATTHEW BARAKAT & MICHAEL LIEDTKE | Associated Press.

He said Google's dominance in the search market is evidence of its monopoly.\n\nGoogle \"enjoys an 89.2% share of the market for general search services, which increases to 94.9% on mobile devices,\" the ruling said.\n\nIt represents a major setback for Google and its parent, Alphabet Inc., which had steadfastly argued that its popularity stemmed from consumers' overwhelming desire to use a search engine so good at what it does that it has become synonymous with looking things up online. Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\n\"I am pleased that Judge Mehta concluded that Google has abused its monopoly power and harmed consumers in the internet search marketplace,\" Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said in a statement. \"This case involved a remarkable level of collaboration between the states and the Justice Department, which will continue as the judge considers how to address these harms.\"\n\nKent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said the company intends to appeal Mehta's findings. \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Walker said.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nAs expected, Mehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nThe Consumer Choice Center, a lobbying group that has fought other attempts to rein in businesses, decried Mehta's decision as a step in the wrong direction. \"The United States is drifting toward the anti-tech posture of the European Union, a part of the world that makes almost nothing and penalizes successful American companies for their popularity,\" said Yael Ossowski, the center's deputy director.\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out billions annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said eMarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google. Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives.\"\n\nRegardless she added, a drawn-out appeals process will delay any immediate effects for both consumers and advertisers.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nIf Mehta decides to limit or ban Google's default search deals, it could squeeze Apple's profits, too. Although parts of his decision were redacted to protect confidential business information, Mehta noted that Google paid Apple an estimated $20 billion in 2022, doubling from 2020. The judge also noted Apple has periodically considered building its own search technology, but backed off that after a 2018 analysis estimated the company would lose more than $12 billion in revenue during the first five years after a break-up with Google.\n\nGoogle's payments have helped Apple's steadily growing services division, which generated $85 billion in revenue during the company's last fiscal year. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Justice Department's antitrust division has recently taken on some of the biggest companies in the world. It sued Apple in March and in May announced a sweeping lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its owner, Live Nation Entertainment. Antitrust enforcers have also opened investigations into the roles Microsoft, Nvidia and OpenAI have played in the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nThe Biden administration has won some big cases, including blocking mergers of some of the world's biggest publishers as well as JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines. It's also had some notable setbacks, including in the sugar and healthcare industries.\n\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.\n\n-- --\n\nAssociated

Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nGoogle almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may land in the U..S. Supreme Court.\n\nAntitrust regulators at the Justice Department filed the lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and the department has been escalating its efforts to rein in technology company power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nAs expected, Mehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle said in response that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed and to restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some services or to stop spending some $20 billion annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways, and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but it now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nBesides aiding Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft spent more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with AI, I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nGoogle faces other legal threats besides this one, both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.", "source": {"uri":

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled Monday, Aug. 5, 2024, that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)\n\nA judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies.\n\nThe highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century.\n\nAfter reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote in his 277-page ruling. He said Google's dominance in the search market is evidence of its monopoly.\n\nGoogle \"enjoys an 89.2% share of the market for general search services, which increases to 94.9% on mobile devices,\" the ruling said.\n\nIt represents a major setback for Google and its parent, Alphabet Inc., which had steadfastly argued that its popularity stemmed from consumers' overwhelming desire to use a search engine so good at what it does that it has become synonymous with looking things up online. Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nKent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said the company intends to appeal Mehta's findings: \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available.\"\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nMehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nThe Consumer Choice Center, a lobbying group that has fought other attempts to rein in businesses, decried Mehta's decision as a step in the wrong direction. \"The United States is drifting toward the anti-tech posture of the European Union, a part of the world that makes almost nothing and penalizes successful American companies for their popularity,\" said Yael Ossowski, the center's deputy director.\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from paying to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other devices. Or, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said eMarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google. Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives.\"\n\nRegardless she added, a drawn-out appeals process will delay any immediate effects for both consumers and advertisers.\n\nLee Hepner, senior legal counsel for the American Economic Liberties Project, believes the tenor of Mehta's ruling makes it likely the judge will decide to prohibit Google from making default search deals and may even look at separating some of its different lines of business.\n\n\"This decision strikes at the core of how hundreds of millions of Americans experience the internet,\" Hepner said. \"It illustrates how Google has become one of the most powerful companies in the world while undermining innovation and degrading the quality of its core product. The remedy must match the court's striking verdict in this case.\"\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nIf Mehta decides to limit or ban Google's default search deals, it could squeeze Apple's profits, too. Although parts of his decision were redacted to protect confidential business information, Mehta noted that Google paid Apple an estimated $20 billion in 2022, doubling from 2020. The judge also noted Apple has periodically considered building its own search technology, but backed off that after a 2018 analysis estimated the company would lose more than $12 billion in revenue during the first five years after a break-up with Google.\n\nGoogle's payments have helped Apple's steadily growing services division, which generated $85 billion in revenue during the company's last fiscal year. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Justice Department's antitrust division has recently taken on some of the biggest companies in the world. It sued Apple in March and in May announced a sweeping lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its owner, Live Nation Entertainment. Antitrust enforcers have also opened investigations into the roles Microsoft, Nvidia and OpenAI have played in the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nThe Biden administration has won some big cases, including blocking mergers of some of the world's biggest publishers as well as JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines. It's also had some notable setbacks, including in the sugar and healthcare industries.\n\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.", "source": {"uri":

He said Google's dominance in the search market is evidence of its monopoly.\n\nGoogle \"enjoys an 89.2% share of the market for general search services, which increases to 94.9% on mobile devices,\" the ruling said.\n\nIt represents a major setback for Google and its parent, Alphabet Inc., which had steadfastly argued that its popularity stemmed from consumers' overwhelming desire to use a search engine so good at what it does that it has become synonymous with looking things up online. Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nKent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said the company intends to appeal Mehta's findings. \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Walker said.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nAs expected, Mehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nThe Consumer Choice Center, a lobbying group that has fought other attempts to rein in businesses, decried Mehta's decision as a step in the wrong direction. \"The United States is drifting toward the anti-tech posture of the European Union, a part of the world that makes almost nothing and penalizes successful American companies for their popularity,\" said Yael Ossowski, the center's deputy director.\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out billions annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said eMarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google. Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives.\"\n\nRegardless she added, a drawn-out appeals process will delay any immediate effects for both consumers and advertisers.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nIf Mehta decides to limit or ban Google's default search deals, it could squeeze Apple's profits, too. Although parts of his decision were redacted to protect confidential business information, Mehta noted that Google paid Apple an estimated $20 billion in 2022, doubling from 2020. The judge also noted Apple has periodically considered building its own search technology, but backed off that after a 2018 analysis estimated the company would lose more than $12 billion in revenue during the first five years after a break-up with Google.\n\nGoogle's payments have helped Apple's steadily growing services division, which generated $85 billion in revenue during the company's last fiscal year. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Justice Department's antitrust division has recently taken on some of the biggest companies in the world. It sued Apple in March and in May announced a sweeping lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its owner, Live Nation Entertainment. Antitrust enforcers have also opened investigations into the roles Microsoft, Nvidia and OpenAI have played in the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nThe Biden administration has won some big cases, including blocking mergers of some of the world's biggest publishers as well as JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines. It's also had some notable setbacks, including in the sugar and healthcare industries.\n\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.\n\n-- --\n\nAssociated

Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, ruling in a case brought against Google by the Justice Department, said that Google had abused its monopoly power over the search business in part by paying companies to present its search engine as the default choice on their devices and web browsers. Mehta also agreed with the government's arguments that Google collected data about consumers to cement its search engine's dominance and illegally protected its monopoly over the ads that run inside Google Search results.\n\nGoogle pays companies including Apple and Mozilla billions of dollars for prime placement in web browsers and on smartphones. According to The New York Times, Google paid Apple about $18 billion to be the default search engine on iPhones in 2021.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote in his opinion filed Monday. \"It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.\"\n\nThe ruling caps off a yearslong case -- U.S. et al. v.

He said Google's dominance in the search market is evidence of its monopoly.\n\nGoogle \"enjoys an 89.2% share of the market for general search services, which increases to 94.9% on mobile devices,\" the ruling said.\n\nIt represents a major setback for Google and its parent, Alphabet Inc., which had steadfastly argued that its popularity stemmed from consumers' overwhelming desire to use a search engine so good at what it does that it has become synonymous with looking things up online. Google's search engine processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nKent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said the company intends to appeal Mehta's findings.\n\n\"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Walker said.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nMehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nThe Consumer Choice Center, a lobbying group that has fought other attempts to rein in businesses, decried Mehta's decision as a step in the wrong direction. \"The United States is drifting toward the anti-tech posture of the European Union, a part of the world that makes almost nothing and penalizes successful American companies for their popularity,\" said Yael Ossowski, the center's deputy director.\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape. He scheduled a Sept. 6 hearing to begin setting the stage for the next phase.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire, or preventing it from paying to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other devices. Or, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf.\n\nRegardless, she added, a drawn-out appeals process will delay any immediate effects for both consumers and advertisers.\n\nThe appeals process could take as long as five years, predicted George Hay, a law professor at Cornell University who was the chief economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division for most of the 1970s. That lengthy process will enable Google to fend off the likelihood of Mehta banning default search agreements, Hay said, but it probably won't shield the company from class-action lawsuits citing the judge's findings that advertisers were gouged with monopolistic pricing.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival, with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nIf Mehta decides to limit or ban Google's default search deals, it could squeeze Apple's profits, too. Although parts of his decision were redacted to protect confidential business information, Mehta noted that Google paid Apple an estimated $20 billion in 2022, doubling from 2020. The judge also noted Apple has periodically considered building its own search technology, but backed off that after a 2018 analysis estimated the company would lose more than $12 billion in revenue during the first five years after a break-up with Google.\n\nGoogle's payments have helped Apple's steadily growing services division, which generated $85 billion in revenue during the company's last fiscal year. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.", "source": {"uri":

The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nJustice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while enjoying the luxury of having more time and money to invest in improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that affected consumers.\n\nGoogle ridiculed the allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they are getting.\n\nFor instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nJudge Mehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sort of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out more than 20 billion dollars (\u00a315 billion) annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices.\n\nAfter the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\nIf there is a significant shake-up, it could be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than three trillion dollars (\u00a32.3 trillion).\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could damage Google at a critical point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that could be affected by Judge Mehta's decision.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured in more than 100 billion dollars in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Mr Nadella said at one point in his evidence. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nHe also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation does not get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with AI, I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" he told the court.\n\nGoogle still faces other legal threats in the US and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.", "source": {"uri":

It is likely to influence other government antitrust lawsuits against Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The last significant antitrust ruling against a tech company targeted Microsoft more than two decades ago.\n\n\"This is the most important antitrust case of the century, and it's the first of a big slate of cases to come down against Big Tech,\" said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor at Vanderbilt University's law school who studies antitrust. \"It's a huge turning point.\"\n\nThe decision is a major blow to Google, which was built on its search engine and has become so closely associated with online search that its name has become a verb. The ruling could have major ramifications for Google's success, especially as the company spends heavily to compete in the race over artificial intelligence. Google faces another federal antitrust case over ad technology that is scheduled to go to trial next month.\n\nMonday's ruling did not include remedies for Google's behavior. Mehta will now decide that, potentially forcing the company to change the way it runs or to sell off part of its business.\n\nMehta's ruling capped a yearslong case -- U.S. et al. v. Google -- that resulted in a 10-week trial last year. The Justice Department and states sued in 2020 over Google's dominance in online search, which generates billions in profits annually. The Justice Department said Google's search engine conducted nearly 90% of web searches, a number the company disputed.\n\nThe company spends billions of dollars annually to be the automatic search engine on browsers such as Apple's Safari and Mozilla's Firefox. Google paid Apple about $18 billion for being the default in 2021, The New York Times has reported.\n\n\"This landmark decision holds Google accountable,\" Jonathan Kanter, the top Justice Department antitrust official, said in a statement. \"It paves the path for innovation for generations to come and protects access to information for all Americans.\"\n\nKent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said the company would appeal the ruling.\n\n\"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" he said. \"As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use.\"\n\nDuring the trial, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified that he was concerned that his competitor's dominance had created a \"Google web\" and that its relationship with Apple was \"oligopolistic.\" If Google continued undeterred, it was likely to become dominant in the race to develop AI, he said.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai countered in his testimony that Google created a better service for consumers.\n\nUsers choose to search on Google because they find it useful, and the company has continued to invest to make it better, the company's lawyers said.\n\n\"Google is winning because it's better,\" John Schmidtlein, Google's lead courtroom lawyer, said during closing arguments, which were held months later, in May.\n\nThe government argued that by paying billions of dollars to be the automatic search engine on consumer devices, Google had denied its competitors the opportunity to build the scale required to compete with its search engine. Instead, Google collected more data about consumers that it used to make its search engine better and more dominant.\n\nMehta sided with the government, saying Google had a monopoly over general online search services. The company's agreements to be the automatic search engine on devices and web browsers hurt competition, making it harder for rivals to challenge Google's dominance.\n\nFor more than a decade, those agreements \"have given Google access to scale that its rivals cannot match,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nThe government also accused Google of protecting a monopoly over the ads that run inside search results. Government lawyers said Google had raised the price of ads beyond the rates that should exist in a free market, which they argued was a sign of the company's power. Search ads provide billions of dollars in annual revenue for Google.\n\nMehta ruled that Google's monopoly allowed it to inflate the prices for some search ads. That, in turn, gave the company more money to pay for its search engine to get prime placement, he said.\n\n\"Unconstrained price increases have fueled Google's dramatic revenue growth and allowed it to maintain high and remarkably stable operating profits,\" he said in the ruling.\n\nMehta ruled in Google's favor on some lesser claims. Google offers advertisers many tools, including one that they use to manage advertising on different search engines. State attorneys general argued during the trial that Google had illegally excluded Microsoft's search engine, Bing, from aspects of those tools. But Mehta ruled against their claim.\n\nLegal scholars expect this decision to influence government antitrust lawsuits against the other tech giants. All of those investigations, conducted by the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, began during the Trump administration and have ramped up under President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Justice Department has sued Apple, arguing that the company made it difficult for consumers to ditch the iPhone, and brought the other case against Google. The FTC has separately sued Meta, claiming the company stamped out nascent competitors, and Amazon, accusing it of squeezing sellers on its online marketplace.\n\nWith those cases, the government is testing 100-year-old laws originally used to rein in utility and other monopolistic companies such as Standard Oil.\n\nA victory for the government provides credibility for its broader attempt to use antitrust laws to take aim at corporate America, said William Kovacic, a former chair of the FTC.\n\n\"It creates momentum that supports their other cases,\" he said in an interview in June.\n\nGoogle has also faced antitrust scrutiny in Europe, where officials charged the company last year with undermining rivals in online advertising.\n\nThe last major U.S. court ruling on a tech antitrust case -- in the Justice Department's 1990s lawsuit against Microsoft -- cast its own shadow over the Google arguments. Mehta repeatedly pressed lawyers to explain how the specifics of the case against Google could fit into the legal precedents.\n\nThe Microsoft antitrust case alleged that the tech giant combined practices such as bullying industry partners and leveraging the popularity of its digital platform, from which users typically didn't switch, to stifle competition.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vanderbilt University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Kanter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Kanter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sundar Pichai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oligopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firefox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kovacic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Kovacic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States v.

Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nKent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said the company intends to appeal Mehta's findings: \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available.\"\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nMehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nThe Consumer Choice Center, a lobbying group that has fought other attempts to rein in businesses, decried Mehta's decision as a step in the wrong direction. \"The United States is drifting toward the anti-tech posture of the European Union, a part of the world that makes almost nothing and penalizes successful American companies for their popularity,\" said Yael Ossowski, the center's deputy director.\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from paying to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other devices. Or, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said eMarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google. Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives.\"\n\nRegardless she added, a drawn-out appeals process will delay any immediate effects for both consumers and advertisers.\n\nLee Hepner, senior legal counsel for the American Economic Liberties Project, believes the tenor of Mehta's ruling makes it likely the judge will decide to prohibit Google from making default search deals and may even look at separating some of its different lines of business.\n\n\"This decision strikes at the core of how hundreds of millions of Americans experience the internet,\" Hepner said. \"It illustrates how Google has become one of the most powerful companies in the world while undermining innovation and degrading the quality of its core product. The remedy must match the court's striking verdict in this case.\"\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nIf Mehta decides to limit or ban Google's default search deals, it could squeeze Apple's profits, too. Although parts of his decision were redacted to protect confidential business information, Mehta noted that Google paid Apple an estimated $20 billion in 2022, doubling from 2020. The judge also noted Apple has periodically considered building its own search technology, but backed off that after a 2018 analysis estimated the company would lose more than $12 billion in revenue during the first five years after a break-up with Google.\n\nGoogle's payments have helped Apple's steadily growing services division, which generated $85 billion in revenue during the company's last fiscal year. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Justice Department's antitrust division has recently taken on some of the biggest companies in the world. It sued Apple in March and in May announced a sweeping lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its owner, Live Nation Entertainment. Antitrust enforcers have also opened investigations into the roles Microsoft, Nvidia and OpenAI have played in the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nThe Biden administration has won some big cases, including blocking mergers of some of the world's biggest publishers as well as JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines. It's also had some notable setbacks, including in the sugar and healthcare industries.\n\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.", "source": {"uri":

He said Google's dominance in the search market is evidence of its monopoly.\n\nGoogle \"enjoys an 89.2% share of the market for general search services, which increases to 94.9% on mobile devices,\" the ruling said.\n\nIt represents a major setback for Google and its parent, Alphabet Inc., which had steadfastly argued that its popularity stemmed from consumers' overwhelming desire to use a search engine so good at what it does that it has become synonymous with looking things up online. Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nKent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said the company intends to appeal Mehta's findings: \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available.\"\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nMehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nThe Consumer Choice Center, a lobbying group that has fought other attempts to rein in businesses, decried Mehta's decision as a step in the wrong direction. \"The United States is drifting toward the anti-tech posture of the European Union, a part of the world that makes almost nothing and penalizes successful American companies for their popularity,\" said Yael Ossowski, the center's deputy director.\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from paying to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other devices. Or, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said eMarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google. Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives.\"\n\nRegardless she added, a drawn-out appeals process will delay any immediate effects for both consumers and advertisers.\n\nLee Hepner, senior legal counsel for the American Economic Liberties Project, believes the tenor of Mehta's ruling makes it likely the judge will decide to prohibit Google from making default search deals and may even look at separating some of its different lines of business.\n\n\"This decision strikes at the core of how hundreds of millions of Americans experience the internet,\" Hepner said. \"It illustrates how Google has become one of the most powerful companies in the world while undermining innovation and degrading the quality of its core product. The remedy must match the court's striking verdict in this case.\"\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nIf Mehta decides to limit or ban Google's default search deals, it could squeeze Apple's profits, too. Although parts of his decision were redacted to protect confidential business information, Mehta noted that Google paid Apple an estimated $20 billion in 2022, doubling from 2020. The judge also noted Apple has periodically considered building its own search technology, but backed off that after a 2018 analysis estimated the company would lose more than $12 billion in revenue during the first five years after a break-up with Google.\n\nGoogle's payments have helped Apple's steadily growing services division, which generated $85 billion in revenue during the company's last fiscal year. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Justice Department's antitrust division has recently taken on some of the biggest companies in the world. It sued Apple in March and in May announced a sweeping lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its owner, Live Nation Entertainment. Antitrust enforcers have also opened investigations into the roles Microsoft, Nvidia and OpenAI have played in the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nThe Biden administration has won some big cases, including blocking mergers of some of the world's biggest publishers as well as JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines. It's also had some notable setbacks, including in the sugar and healthcare industries.\n\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.\n\n-- --\n\nAssociated

The filing also noted that Google was the best search option, however.\n\n\"Google has not achieved market dominance by happenstance,\" Mehta stated.\n\nThe company has \"hired thousands of highly skilled engineers, innovated consistently, and made shrewd business decisions\", the judge noted.\n\n\"The result is the industry's highest quality search engine, which has earned Google the trust of hundreds of millions of daily users.\"\n\nThat isn't all Google did, Mehta added.\n\n\"But Google also has a major, largely unseen advantage over its rivals: default distribution. And to achieve that, Google has signed agreements worth billions with browser developers, mobile device makers, and mobile operators to make sure Google is the default search engine. And that has led to a monopoly in search.\"\n\nAfter a nine-week trial, petabytes of data, and 3,500 exhibits, Mehta said the court reached the conclusion that Google was a \"monopolist\" and has actively sought to maintain that monopoly.\n\nGoogle had argued that rival search engines simply weren't as good, and that the trial should consider other ways to search the internet, such as via social media.\n\n\"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Kent Walker, President of Google Global Affairs, said in a statement.\n\n\"As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use,\" Walker added, according to Bloomberg.\n\nBeyond appeals, which could take years, a followup trial will next have to decide the \"remedy\" for Google's monopoly in search.\n\nThat could include an order to break up parent company Alphabet, though other solutions are possible, including banning Google from offering search deals or opening up its search system to other providers.\n\nEvidence was presented during the trial of Google being forced to offer a range of search engine options in Europe, but that was shown to have little impact.\n\n\"Win for Americans\"\n\nThe win was celebrated by US leaders. The White House press secretary said it was a \"victory for the American people.\"\n\nDemocratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said on X that it could herald further regulation of the sector down the road.\n\n\"This is a huge victory for the American people and shows the importance of enforcing our antitrust laws and why I am advocating for competition rules of the road for monopoly tech companies,\" she wrote.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland echoed that, saying the case was a \"historic win\", adding in a statement: \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nAssistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter said the decision would help hold Google accountable. \"It paves the path for innovation for generations to come and protects access to information for all Americans,\" he added.\n\nITPro has approached Alphabet, but the company did not immediately respond.", "source": {"uri": "itpro.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITProUK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "george_fitzmaurice@itpro.com", "name": "George Fitzmaurice", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Kanter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Kanter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Klobuchar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amy Klobuchar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Assistant_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Assistant Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Web_Design_and_Development", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Web Design and Development", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Recruitment_and_Staffing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Recruitment and Staffing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Information_Retrieval", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Information Retrieval", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Search_Engines", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Search Engines", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PCCq4eyvkemdfJvS3huzmB-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Federal judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google had violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act, concluding that Google is a monopolist that has spent billions of dollars trying to maintain that monopoly.\n\nNot only is it extremely rare for a major corporation to be formally ruled to be illegally operating a monopoly, but it's been hinted by antitrust officials that a possible Google breakup could be on the cards. It all depends on the outcome of the remedy phase, which will see Google appeal the ruling and a trial to determine how the search giant should be punished.\n\nSo what happens next?\n\nThe ruling is that Google has violated section 2 of the Sherman Act, an antitrust law that's been on the books since 1890 -- specifically designed to outlaw monopolistic practices and encourage competition. The specific charges were that Google had violated two key areas of the Act: general search services and general text advertising via exclusive distribution agreements.\n\nPart of the latter involves exclusive contracts Google has with Apple, which received billions of dollars in exchange for Google being the default search engine on Apple phones and browsers -- a deal that reportedly cost Google $26.3 billion in 2021.\n\nMicrosoft was previously charged with violating similar laws in the late '90s, having been accused of monopolizing the web browser marketing Windows. It was originally ruled that Microsoft had operated an illegal monopoly, though this decision was overturned in appeals with Microsoft and settling the case out of court.\n\nJudge Mehta's ruling praised Google for its engineering skill and the investment it made in search. However, he noted that the company's exclusive deals gave it an unseen advantage that other search engines didn't have -- default distribution.\n\nWhile the Microsoft ruling was a case of illegally excluding rival browsers and platforms, Google was offering generous payments to maintain its dominance. This is where the problems arose, and the antitrust prosecutors claimed that people rarely change the default settings. Expert witness Antonio Rangel, the professor of neuroscience, behavioral psychology and economics at CalTech, testified that \"the vast majority\" of searches are done out of habit.\n\nThe case also revealed that Google controlled around 90% of the online search market, which rises to 95% when you focus on smartphones.\n\nGoogle maintained that it offered a superior product, hence the dominance, but Judge Mehta pointed to the \"power of defaults\" as helping maintain Google's dominance in the field. On top of that, the more users that use Google, the more data it can collect, which in turn can be used to improve the quality of search results. That's a vicious cycle that would leave other search engines like Bing or DuckDuckGo at a disadvantage.\n\nThe crucial thing here is that the case isn't over yet. We're now entering what's known as the \"remedy\" phase, and Reuters points out that this is likely to be a lengthy process -- possibly stretching until 2025 or 2026. This will involve Google appealing the ruling with the U.S. Court of Appeals, the District of Columbia Circuit, and the U.S. Supreme Court. And Google has confirmed that the fight isn't over yet.\n\nKent Walker, President of Global Affairs at Google, said, \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available.\" Walker also notes that Google appreciates how the courts stated, on record, that Google is \"the industry's highest quality search engine, which has earned Google the trust of hundreds of millions of daily users.\" He said Google \"has long been the best search engine, particularly on mobile devices,\" \"has continued to innovate in search,\" and that \"Apple and Mozilla occasionally assess Google's search quality relative to its rivals and find Google's to be superior.\"\n\n\"Given this, and that people are increasingly looking for information in more and more ways, we plan to appeal. As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use.\"\n\nThe specifics of that appeal aren't clear right now, but it's obvious Google won't be going down without a fight. Presumably, though, business will continue as usual until the case has run its course. At that point, we'll find out how the ruling will affect Google and its current corporate structure.\n\nAvi Greengart from analyst firm Techsponential told Tom's Guide, \"As always with government intervention in tech, by the time this case finishes all the appeals and remedies processes, we may all be using genAI search from a different company anyway.\" In other words, it'll be some time before any repercussions actually affect consumers -- assuming they ever do.\n\nHowever, the impact on consumers is not comparable to how the ruling may affect other antitrust cases against large tech companies in the future.\n\nLuther Lowe, the head of public policy for venture capital startup backer Y Combinator, commented on X, \"Remember: US v Google case is broken into two parts. We now enter the remedy phase. This ruling could significantly reshape the competitive landscape to benefit \"little tech\" by reducing Google's gatekeeping power & creating more open competition in search & digital advertising.\"\n\nAdam Epstein, co-CEO and president of adMarketplace, also praised Judge Mehta for how thorough he was in \"understanding the complexities of the search results and ads markets to reach the right decision.\" He added that \"This is a massive win for the Government. And for the first time in decades, it shows that antitrust law can help define the boundaries between democracy and capitalism when it comes to Big Tech.\"\n\nGoogle is far from the only tech company accused of violating antitrust laws in recent years, and regulators have leveled accusations against Apple, Amazon and Meta for ensuring their platforms give their own products an advantage -- while smaller rivals are acquired before they can post too much of a threat. Google itself is also subject to a second antitrust lawsuit, focussing on ad technology, which is expected to go to trial next month.\n\nThe wheels of the legal system take a long time to move, and the fact this case has been ongoing since 2020 is a clear indicator of that in action. So, it could be at leat a couple of years before the Remedy and appeals phases actually run their course. It'll be a while before everyday consumers feel the effects of this ruling.\n\nWithout knowing what consequences Google will face for breaking antitrust laws, it's difficult to say just how much this might impact users. Prosecutors have hinted that they may want to break up Google's parent company, Alphabet, which could see various parts of the business spun off into their own solo companies.\n\nAnd while bad news for Alphabet and Google, ordinary consumers may not notice any change -- so long as the spun-off services continue to operate and stay online. For most people, it doesn't make the slightest difference that the search engine you use to find chili recipes comes from the same company that dabbles in smartphone software and self-driving cars.\n\nThe biggest change may be that Google ceases to be the default search engine on various devices and platforms. So, if you set up an iPhone 18 in late 2026, you may find that your smartphone is asking you to choose your own default search engine rather than automatically pushing you onto Google. It's similar to how Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Edge asked you if you wanted to install a new internet browser when you load up a PC for the first time.\n\nMost people will probably pick Google anyway because that's what they're used to. This means that Google may still retain its dominant position as a leader in the search market. As Damien Rollins, COO director of market insights, SoCi marketing shared, few consumers are likely to care about Google's dominant position in the search market. But that dominance is under threat now thanks to a rise in AI-powered alternatives and \"increasing complaints about Google's declining search quality.\"\n\nIn that kind of scenario, it would mean Google has to push to make sure its product is best without relying on the fact that most people will just use whatever they're told to use. Some people might choose to use something else if given the chance.", "source": {"uri": "tomsguide.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tom's Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_pritchard@tomsguide.com",

A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. Ng Han Guan/Associated Press, file\n\nWASHINGTON -- A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies.\n\nThe highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Department of Justice against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter of a century.\n\nAfter reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\nIt represents a major setback for Google and its parent company, Alphabet Inc., which had steadfastly argued that its popularity stemmed from consumers' overwhelming desire to use a search engine so good at what it does that it has become synonymous with looking things up online. Google's search engine processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly double its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nGoogle almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was president and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Biden's administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine - a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo - now a minor player on the internet - was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nRelated U.S. claims Google pays more than $10 billion a year to maintain its search dominance\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out more than $20 billion annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software-maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways, and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but it now trails its rival, with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nRelated Google, Justice Department argue whether search engine is a monopoly\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with AI, I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nGoogle still faces other legal threats besides this one, both in the U.S. and abroad. any antitrust lawsuits brought against Google domestically and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.\n\nCopy the Story Link

Google now handles an estimated 8.5 billion searches worldwide every day, nearly double the daily volume of 12 years ago, according to Google. a recent study released by the investment company BOND.\n\nGoogle will almost certainly appeal the decision, and the case could end up in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe decision tentatively confirms the case of antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed the lawsuit nearly four years ago when Donald Trump was still president and has ramped up efforts to curb the power of Big Tech during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nThe case cast Google as a technological bully that has methodically thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly allowed it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while giving it the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax policy that hurt consumers.\n\nAs expected, Mehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends each year to install its search engine as the default option on new mobile phones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle laughed off the accusations, noting that consumers have historically switched search engines when they were disappointed with the results they received. Yahoo, for example, now a minor player on the Internet, was the most popular search engine in the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the defaults. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% of the search market in the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows that other search engines can be successful if Google is not established as the predetermined default option.\n\nYet Mehta also called the quality of Google's product a key component of its dominance, saying bluntly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nMehta's finding that Google has an illegal monopoly opens a new legal stage to determine what changes or penalties should be imposed to undo the damage and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a broadly supported injunction requiring Google to dismantle some pillars of its Internet empire or stop it from spending billions annually to ensure that its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other Internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude that only modest changes are needed to level the playing field.\n\nIf a major change happens, it could be a coup for Microsoft. The company's power was undermined in the late 1990s when the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against the software maker, accusing it of abusing the dominant position of its Windows operating system on PCs to shut out competitors.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in different ways, and now the outcome could echo in the same way. Just as Microsoft's fierce antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its founding in 1998, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. Alphabet was once worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nIn addition to boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hit Google at a crucial tipping point that is pivoting technology into the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that could now be influenced by Mehta's market-disrupting decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during testimony in which he expressed frustration with deals Google made with companies like Apple that made it nearly impossible for its Bing search engine to make progress even as Microsoft has poured more than $100 billion into improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You wake up in the morning, you brush your teeth, and you Google it,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everyone talks about the open web, but there really is the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that an anti-monopoly measure would be needed to prevent the situation from worsening. as AI becomes a greater force in search.\n\n\"Despite my excitement that there is a new angle for AI, I am deeply concerned that the vicious cycle I find myself caught in could become even more vicious,\" Nadella said during testimony.\n\nGoogle still faces other legal threats besides this one, both in the U.S. and abroad. All the antitrust lawsuits filed against Google at home and abroad. In September, a federal trial begins in Virginia over the Department of Justice's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.", "source": {"uri":

Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said Google had abused a monopoly over the search business. The Justice Department and states had sued Google, accusing it of illegally cementing its dominance, in part, by paying other companies, such as Apple and Samsung, billions of dollars a year to have Google automatically handle search queries on their smartphones and web browsers.\n\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nThe ruling is the most significant victory to date for U.S. regulators who are trying to rein in the power of tech giants in the internet era. It is likely to influence other government antitrust lawsuits against Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nThe ruling did not include remedies for Google's behavior. Mehta will now decide that, potentially forcing the company to change the way it runs or to sell off part of its business.\n\nThe ruling capped a yearslong case -- U.S. et al. v. Google -- that resulted in a 10-week trial last year. The Justice Department and states sued in 2020 over Google's dominance in online search, which generates billions in profits annually. The Justice Department said Google's search engine conducted nearly 90% of web searches, a number the company disputed.\n\nThe company spends billions of dollars annually to be the automatic search engine on browsers like Apple's Safari and Mozilla's Firefox. Google paid Apple about $18 billion for being the default in 2021, The New York Times reported.\n\nDuring the trial, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified that he was concerned that his competitor's dominance had created a \"Google web\" and that its relationship with Apple was \"oligopolistic.\" If Google continued undeterred, it was likely to become dominant in the race to develop artificial intelligence, he said.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai countered in his testimony that Google created a better service for consumers.\n\nUsers choose to search on Google because they find it useful, and the company has continued to invest to make it better, the company's lawyers said.\n\n\"Google is winning because it's better,\" John Schmidtlein, Google's lead courtroom lawyer, said during closing arguments, which were held months later, in May.\n\nThe government argued that by paying billions of dollars to be the automatic search engine on consumer devices, Google had denied its competitors the opportunity to build the scale required to compete with its search engine. Instead, Google collected more data about consumers that it used to make its search engine better and more dominant.\n\nThe government also accused Google of protecting a monopoly over the ads that run inside search results.

Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nGoogle almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may land in the U..S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nAs expected, Mehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out billions annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nGoogle still faces other legal threats besides this one, both in the U.S. and abroad. any antitrust lawsuits brought against Google domestically and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.\n\nMatthew Barakat And

Google acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search, a federal judge has ruled, a decision that strikes at the power of big tech companies and that may fundamentally alter the way they do business Jason Henry/The New York Times\n\nGoogle acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search, a federal judge ruled Monday, a decision that strikes at the power of Big Tech companies and that may fundamentally alter the way they do business.\n\nJudge Amit P. Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said Google had abused a monopoly over the search business. The Justice Department and states had sued Google, accusing it of illegally cementing its dominance, in part, by paying other companies, such as Apple and Samsung, billions of dollars a year to have Google automatically handle search queries on their smartphones and web browsers.\n\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nThe ruling is the most significant victory to date for U.S. regulators who are trying to rein in the power of tech giants in the internet era. It is likely to influence other government antitrust lawsuits against Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nThe ruling did not include remedies for Google's behavior. Mehta will now decide that, potentially forcing the company to change the way it runs or to sell off part of its business.\n\nThe ruling capped a yearslong case -- U.S. et al. v. Google -- that resulted in a 10-week trial last year. The Justice Department and states sued in 2020 over Google's dominance in online search, which generates billions in profits annually. The Justice Department said Google's search engine conducted nearly 90% of web searches, a number the company disputed.\n\nThe company spends billions of dollars annually to be the automatic search engine on browsers like Apple's Safari and Mozilla's Firefox. Google paid Apple about $18 billion for being the default in 2021, The New York Times reported.\n\nDuring the trial, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified that he was concerned that his competitor's dominance had created a \"Google web\" and that its relationship with Apple was \"oligopolistic.\" If Google continued undeterred, it was likely to become dominant in the race to develop artificial intelligence, he said.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai countered in his testimony that Google created a better service for consumers.\n\nUsers choose to search on Google because they find it useful, and the company has continued to invest to make it better, the company's lawyers said.\n\n\"Google is winning because it's better,\" John Schmidtlein, Google's lead courtroom lawyer, said during closing arguments, which were held months later, in May.\n\nThe government argued that by paying billions of dollars to be the automatic search engine on consumer devices, Google had denied its competitors the opportunity to build the scale required to compete with its search engine. Instead, Google collected more data about consumers that it used to make its search engine better and more dominant.\n\nThe government also accused Google of protecting a monopoly over the ads that run inside search results. Government lawyers said Google had raised the price of ads beyond the rates that should exist in a free market, which they argued was a sign of the company's power. Search ads provide billions of dollars in annual revenue for Google.\n\nDuring closing arguments, Mehta grilled the lawyers about factual statements and asked them to explain how their cases squared with legal precedent.\n\n\"The importance and significance of this case is not lost on me, not only for Google but for the public,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "telegraphindia.com", "dataType":

Yesterday, Google lost in court.\n\nDavid McCabe, NYT (\"'Google Is a Monopolist,' Judge Rules in Landmark Antitrust Case\"):\n\nGoogle acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search, a federal judge ruled on Monday, a landmark decision that strikes at the power of tech giants in the modern internet era and that may fundamentally alter the way they do business.\n\nJudge Amit P. Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said in a 277-page ruling that Google had abused a monopoly over the search business. The Justice Department and states had sued Google, accusing it of illegally cementing its dominance, in part, by paying other companies, like Apple and Samsung, billions of dollars a year to have Google automatically handle search queries on their smartphones and web browsers.\n\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Judge Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nThe ruling is a harsh verdict on the rise of giant technology companies that have used their roots in the internet to influence the way we shop, consume information and search online -- and indicates a potential limit of Big Tech's power. It is likely to influence other government antitrust lawsuits against Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The last significant antitrust ruling against a tech company targeted Microsoft more than two decades ago.\n\n\"This is the most important antitrust case of the century, and it's the first of a big slate of cases to come down against Big Tech,\" said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor at Vanderbilt University's law school who studies antitrust. \"It's a huge turning point.\"\n\nWhile most anti-trust action focuses on harm to consumers, the thrust of this case was harm to competitors and those paying to advertise on the site:\n\nThe government argued that by paying billions of dollars to be the automatic search engine on consumer devices, Google had denied its competitors the opportunity to build the scale required to compete with its search engine. Instead, Google collected more data about consumers that it used to make its search engine better and more dominant.\n\nJudge Mehta sided with the government, saying Google had a monopoly over general online search services. The company's agreements to be the automatic search engine on devices and web browsers hurt competition, making it harder for rivals to challenge Google's dominance.\n\nFor more than a decade, those agreements \"have given Google access to scale that its rivals cannot match,\" Judge Mehta wrote.\n\nThe government also accused Google of protecting a monopoly over the ads that run inside search results. Government lawyers said Google had raised the price of ads beyond the rates that should exist in a free market, which they argued was a sign of the company's power. Search ads provide billions of dollars in annual revenue for Google.\n\nJudge Mehta ruled that Google's monopoly allowed it to inflate the prices for some search ads. That, in turn, gave the company more money to pay for its search engine to get prime placement, he said.\n\n\"Unconstrained price increases have fueled Google's dramatic revenue growth and allowed it to maintain high and remarkably stable operating profits,\" he said in the ruling.\n\nWhile there are plenty of other search engines out there, Google is clearly the dominant actors, with estimates ranging from 60.4 percent to 90.3 percent of the US market. Google argues, correctly, that it is the dominant search engine because it produces better results for consumers. The government argues, also correctly, that Google's dominance allows it to collect more data from said consumers and thus charge more to advertisers. The judge* agreed.\n\nWe're waiting now for the next shoe to drop. What penalties will Mehta impose? Will he force Alphabet to divest some of its properties? Levy massive fines? Something else?\n\nOne imagines that Google's competitors are happy. For now. But they're all massive enterprises. Assuming continued Democratic control of the DOJ after November's election, will it be going after them next?\n\nAnd to what end for consumers? It may well be that search, certain software, and social media networks are natural monopolies. Yes, we've seen the enshittification of Google search as it gets bogged down with more ads. But will we get better results if Bing or DuckDuckGo get more market share? Interestingly, that doesn't seem to be of interest to this cohort of trust-busters.\n\n*While Judge Mehta's name is a familiar one, I do find it mildly amusing that his name reads like one of Google's chief competitors.", "source": {"uri": "outsidethebeltway.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Outside the Beltway"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_joyner@outsidethebeltway.com", "name": "James Joyner",

It is likely to influence other government antitrust lawsuits against Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nThe ruling did not include remedies for Google's behavior. Judge Mehta will now decide that, potentially forcing the company to change the way it runs or to sell off part of its business.\n\nThe ruling capped a yearslong case -- U.S. et al. v. Google -- that resulted in a 10-week trial last year. The Justice Department and states sued in 2020 over Google's dominance in online search, which generates billions in profits annually. The Justice Department said Google's search engine conducted nearly 90 percent of web searches, a number the company disputed.\n\nThe company spends billions of dollars annually to be the automatic search engine on browsers like Apple's Safari and Mozilla's Firefox. Google paid Apple about $18 billion for being the default in 2021, The New York Times reported.\n\nDuring the trial, Microsoft's chief executive, Satya Nadella, testified that he was concerned that his competitor's dominance had created a \"Google web\" and that its relationship with Apple was \"oligopolistic.\" If Google continued undeterred, it was likely to become dominant in the race to develop artificial intelligence, he said.\n\nGoogle's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, countered in his testimony that Google created a better service for consumers.\n\nUsers choose to search on Google because they find it useful, and the company has continued to invest to make it better, the company's lawyers said.\n\n\"Google is winning because it's better,\" John Schmidtlein, Google's lead courtroom lawyer, said during closing arguments, which were held months later in May.\n\nThe government argued that by paying billions of dollars to be the automatic search engine on consumer devices, Google had denied its competitors the opportunity to build the scale required to compete with its search engine. Instead, Google collected more data about consumers that it used to make its search engine better and more dominant.\n\nThe government also accused Google of protecting a monopoly over the ads that run inside search results. Government lawyers said Google had raised the price of ads beyond the rates that should exist in a free market, which they argued was a sign of the company's power. Search ads provide billions of dollars in annual revenue for Google.\n\nDuring closing arguments, Judge Mehta grilled the lawyers about factual statements and asked them to explain how their cases squared with legal precedent.\n\n\"The importance and significance of this case is not lost on me, not only for Google but for the public,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the District of Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firefox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sundar Pichai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Google-Violated-Antitrust-Laws-in-Online-Search-Judge-Rules.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Google owes much of its more than $300 billion in annual revenue to search ads.\n\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nThe massive win for the Justice Department could fundamentally reshape how Google does business. It also could change how we use the internet and search for information.\n\nThe Justice Department filed antitrust charges during the final weeks of the Trump administration, making good on Donald Trump's pledge to challenge the runaway power of Big Tech. That mission continued during the Biden administration, which has been aggressive in pursuing antitrust cases.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" Attorney General Garland said in a statement. \"No company - no matter how large or influential - is above the law.\"\n\nThe case is the most significant victory for the Justice Department in a monopoly case in decades, said Notre Dame Law School professor Roger Alford, who served in the Justice Department's antitrust division. \"Not since Microsoft lost in the 1990s have we seen a case of this magnitude.\"\n\nGoogle said it would appeal the decision. \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Kent Walker, president of global affairs, said in a statement.\n\nShares in Google parent company Alphabet slipped following the judge's ruling. They closed down nearly 5% Monday, part of a broader tech stock selloff.\n\nIf upheld, the decision will be a \"major boost\" for other antitrust cases pending against Google as well as other major tech players like Amazon, Apple and Meta, said Loyola University Chicago School of Law professor Spencer Weber Waller.\n\nMonday's ruling did not include remedies. Remedies will be decided separately, likely after an appeal. One remedy could see Google losing its ability to strike device deals that have helped make its search engine so ubiquitous.\n\nDevising the right remedy is critical to restoring competition to the marketplace, Waller said.\n\n\"There are no fines or monetary penalties in these types of cases, but the court will have to decide whether Google should be broken up in some way. More likely, it will order Google to eliminate the exclusive contracts and licensing restrictions that have reinforced its monopoly position for years,\" he said.\n\nGoogle has argued that its distribution deals are common in the business world. It pays for its search engine to be on phones the way a food manufacturer pays to promote its products at eye level in a grocery store aisle.\n\nThe way Google sees it, if you don't like Google, you can switch the default search engine on your device. But people don't switch, Google says, because they prefer Google.\n\nIf Google was not the default search engine on so many devices, would consumers still use it for 90% of web searches?\n\nDuring the 10-week trial, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified that Google's unchallenged dominance created a \"Google web.\"\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella has expressed concern that Microsoft's disadvantage would increase as artificial intelligence becomes a major component of search.\n\nIn a research note Monday, Baird Equity Research senior analyst Colin Sebastian pointed to a range of tactics Google's arch competitor Microsoft has used to grow market share of its Bing search engine over the years, from paying users to use its search engine to embedding it in Office.\n\n\"People clearly prefer Google to Bing,\" Sebastian said.\n\nChamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich said Monday's ruling hands Microsoft an unearned boost.\n\n\"The biggest winner from today's ruling isn't consumers or little tech, it's Microsoft,\" Kovacevich said in a statement. \"Microsoft has underinvested in search for decades, but today's ruling opens the door to a court mandate of default deals for Bing. That's a slap in the face to consumers who chose Google because they think it's the best.\"", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Google is dropping plans to eliminate cookies from its Chrome web browser, making a sudden U-turn on four years of work to phase out the technology that tracks users for ad purposes. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan, File)WASHINGTON (AP) - A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century. After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May. \"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote in his 277-page ruling. It represents a major setback for Google and its parent, Alphabet Inc., which had steadfastly argued that its popularity stemmed from consumers' overwhelming desire to use a search engine so good at what it does that it has become synonymous with looking things up online. Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND. Google almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may land in the U..S. Supreme Court. For now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration. The case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine - a lax approach that hurt consumers. As expected, Mehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling. Google ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo - now a minor player on the internet - was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along. Mehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option. Still, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\u009d Mehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape. The potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out billions annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field. If there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition. That Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion. Besides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009. \"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\"\u009d Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\u009d Nadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search. \"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\"\u009d Nadella said on the stand. Google still faces other legal threats besides this one, both in the U.S. and abroad. any antitrust lawsuits brought against Google domestically and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.", "source": {"uri":

The fines or other remedies will be decided in a future hearing.\n\nThe government has asked for \"structural relief\" - which could, in theory at least, mean the break-up of the company.\n\nIn his decision, US district judge Amit Mehta said Google had paid billions to ensure it is the default search engine on smartphones and browsers.\n\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote in his 277-page opinion.\n\nAlphabet said it plans to appeal against the ruling.\n\n\"This decision recognises that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" noted a statement from the company.\n\nUS attorney general Merrick Garland, the country's top prosecutor, hailed the ruling as a \"historic win for the American people\".\n\n\"No company - no matter how large or influential - is above the law,\" Garland said in a statement on Monday.\n\n\"The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nFederal antitrust regulators have filed other pending lawsuits against Big Tech companies - including Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook, Amazon.com and Apple Inc - accusing them of operating unlawful monopolies.\n\nMonday's ruling comes after a 10-week trial in Washington DC, in which prosecutors accused Google of paying billions of dollars annually to Apple, Samsung, Mozilla and others to be pre-installed as the default search engine across platforms.\n\nThe US said Google typically pays more than US$10 billion (N$185 billion) a year for that privilege, securing its access to a steady stream of user data that helped maintain its hold on the market.\n\nDoing so, prosecutors said, meant other companies have not had the opportunity or resources to meaningfully compete.\n\n\"The best testimony for that, for the importance of defaults, is Google's cheque book,\" argued Department of Justice lawyer Kenneth Dintzer during the trial.\n\nGoogle's search engine is a big revenue generator for the company, bringing in billions of dollars thanks in large part to advertising displayed on its results pages.\n\nGoogle's lawyers defended the company by saying that users are attracted to their search engine because they find it useful, and that Google is investing to make it better for consumers.\n\n\"Google is winning because it's better,\" said Google's lawyer John Schmidtlein during closing arguments earlier this year.\n\nSchmidtlein also argued during the trial that Google still faces intense competition, not just from general search engine firms, such as Microsoft's Bing, but more specialised sites and apps that people use to find restaurants, airline flights and more.\n\nIn his ruling, Mehta concluded that being the default search engine is \"extremely valuable real estate\" for Google.\n\n\"Even if a new entrant were positioned from a quality standpoint to bid for the default when an agreement expires, such a firm could compete only if it were prepared to pay partners upwards of billions of dollars in revenue share,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nAnother case against the company over its advertising technology is scheduled to go to trial in September.

Mehta has issued his ruling in a closely watched antitrust case against Google, ruling the search giant is a monopoly.\n\nThe Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Google last year, claiming the company is a monopoly that unfairly and illegally uses its monopoly power to stifle competition in the search market.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, after a ten-month trial, Judge Mehta has ruled against Google, concluding the company is not only a monopoly, but one that is abusing its market position.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Judge Mehta wrote in his ruling.\n\nGoogle's Exclusivity Deals\n\nThroughout the case, Google's attorneys tried to argue that the company holds the dominant position in the market purely because it is better.\n\n\"Google is winning because it's better,\" argued John Schmidtlein, Google's lead attorney on the case.\n\nIn contrast, the DOJ maintained that Google's deals have helped artificially keep it at the top, to the exclusion of other options. In particular, the DOJ scrutinized deals with Apple, Mozilla, and other vendors that have kept Google the default search engine across platforms.\n\nAs the Times points out, those deals gave Google access to a treasure trove of consumer data and search habits that gave it an even greater advantage in honing its search engine and shutting out rivals. Judge Mehta agreed with the DOJ's case, calling out Google's deals\n\nGoogle has not achieved market dominance by happenstance. It has hired thousands of highly skilled engineers, innovated consistently, and made shrewd business decisions. The result is the industry's highest quality search engine, which has earned Google the trust of hundreds of millions of daily users.\n\nBut Google also has a major, largely unseen advantage over its rivals: default distribution. Most users access a general search engine through a browser (like Apple's Safari) or a search widget that comes preloaded on a mobile device. Those search access points are preset with a \"default\" search engine. The default is extremely valuable real estate. Because many users simply stick to searching with the default, Google receives billions of queries every day through those access points. Google drives extraordinary volumes of user data from such searches. It then uses that information to improve search quality. Google so values such data that, absent a user-initiated change, it stores 18 months-worth of a user's search history and activity.\n\nThe distribution agreements benefit Google in another important way. More users mean more advertisers, and more advertisers mean more revenues. As queries on Google have grown, so too has the amount it earns in advertising dollars. In 2014, Google booked nearly $47 billion in advertising revenue. By 2021, that number had increased more than three-fold to over $146 billion. Bing, by comparison, generated only a fraction of that amount -- less than $12 billion in 2022.\n\nJudge Mehta then broke down his ruling.\n\nSpecifically, the court holds that (1) there are relevant product markets for general search services and general search text ads; (2) Google has monopoly power in those markets; (3) Google's distribution agreements are exclusive and have anticompetitive effects; and (4) Google has not offered valid procompetitive justifications for those agreements. Importantly, the court also finds that Google has exercised its monopoly power by charging supracompetitive prices for general search text ads. That conduct has allowed Google to earn monopoly profits.\n\nOn the Alleged Destruction of Communications and Evidence\n\nThe DOJ accused Google of intentionally deleting internal communication that could implicate it, even after it was warned to retain such communications. Judge Mehta declined to impose sanctions -- while acknowledging Google's actions could very well warrant them -- only because it would not change Google's liability.\n\nJudge Mehta did, however, take note of Google's tremendous effort to ensure there were no smoking guns that could be used against it in the form of internal communications, drawing a direct comparison to how many such smoking guns existed in Microsoft's antitrust case decades ago.\n\nStill, the court is taken aback by the lengths to which Google goes to avoid creating a paper trail for regulators and litigants....Google clearly to to heart the lessons from these cases. It trained its employees, rather effectively, not to create \"bad\" evidence. Ultimately, it does not matter. Section 2 liability does not rise or fall on whether there is \"smoking gun\" proof of anticompetitive intent.\n\nJudge Mehta did not address penalties in this ruling, although the possibilities run the full gamut. At the very least, Google will likely face stiff monetary fines. The company may be prohibited from striking the kind of deals that have helped it maintain its dominance. Google may be forced to adopt a measure similar to what Apple was forced to do in the EU, namely give users a first-run option to choose their search engine, rather than defaulting to Google. At the most extreme end of the spectrum, the DOJ could seek to break up Google during the penalty proceedings.\n\nWhatever the outcome, Google is sure to appeal, meaning this case is far from over.", "source": {"uri": "webpronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WebProNews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_milano@webpronews.com", "name": "Matt Milano", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mozilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_widget", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software widget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States v.

Google has violated US antitrust law, according to the ruling.\n\n\"Google [has] a major, largely unseen advantage over its rivals: default distribution,\" the ruling explains. \"Most users access a general search engine through a browser (like Apple's Safari) or a search widget that comes preloaded on a mobile device. Those search access points are preset with a 'default' search engine. The default is extremely valuable real estate.\"\n\n\"For years, Google has secured default placements through distribution contracts. It has entered into such agreements with browser developers, mobile device manufacturers, and wireless carriers. These partners agree to install Google as the search engine that is delivered to the user right out of the box at key search access points,\" the decision asserts. \"Google pays huge sums to secure these preloaded defaults.\"\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" writes US District Judge Amit Mehta. \"It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.\"\n\nThe court's decision is an enormous rebuke of Google's oldest and most significant business. The Alphabet Inc.-owned company has spent in the tens of billions of dollars on exclusive contracts in order to secure a dominant position as the default search engine provider worldwide.\n\nNamely, Google's exclusive deals with key players in the mobile ecosystem, like Apple, have helped it achieved a powerful position that has led to anticompetitive behavior. Google has also charged high prices in search advertising that reflect its monopoly in the search engine game, said Mehta. Those contracts have meant for years that when users want to find information, Google has typically been the easiest and quickest platform to do that, which has fueled the company's vast online advertising business.\n\nIt's important to note that the court did not find Google to be a monopoly in search ads; this case is separate from an antitrust lawsuit filed against Google by the Biden administration in 2023, which was related to the company's advertising technology business. But Judge Mehta's ruling on Monday stands as the first major federal decision in a series of US government-led antitrust lawsuits against tech companies, described as the biggest tech antitrust case since U.S. v. Microsoft nearly 25 years ago.\n\nIn December, a federal jury in California ruled that Google operates an illegal monopoly with its proprietary app store. The court is still deliberating potential solutions in that case. Meanwhile, Mehta's decision is expected to trigger a separate proceeding to determine what penalties the company will face. Google is likely to file an appeal at that point -- which means it could ultimately take months or potentially years for the consequences to fully play out.

Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nGoogle almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may land in the U..S. Supreme Court.\n\nMONEY TALKS: Google pays more than $10 billion yearly to maintain search dominance, feds say\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nSOMETHING TO HIDE? Google 'not truthful,' tried to 'subvert' court process by deleting evidence in monopoly case, judge rules\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out more than $20 billion annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nGoogle still faces other legal threats besides this one, both in the U.S. and abroad. any antitrust lawsuits brought against Google domestically and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.", "source": {"uri":

That was what a federal judge ruled on Monday in a landmark case that may lead the company to significantly change its operations.\n\n\"Google is a monopolist and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" said the court, finding the tech company violated antitrust laws.\n\nThe decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, which Google said it will appeal, may mean there will be additional legal proceedings to determine what the company needs to do in order to change to no longer violate antitrust.\n\nThe case was brought forward after the Justice Department and several states sued, alleging Google dominated search via illegally maintaining its monopoly.\n\n\"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available. We appreciate the Court's finding that Google is 'the industry's highest quality search engine, which has earned Google the trust of hundreds of millions of daily users,' that Google 'has long been the best search engine, particularly on mobile devices,' 'has continued to innovate in search' and that 'Apple and Mozilla occasionally assess Google's search quality relative to its rivals and find Google's to be superior.' Given this, and that people are increasingly looking for information in more and more ways, we plan to appeal. As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use,\" said Kent Walker, president of global affairs at Google in a statement to the Deseret News.\n\nIn the ruling, the judge said the offense of monopolization requires proof in two areas: 1) a company does hold a monopoly and 2) willfully maintaining that power outside of accident or business acumen or having a superior product.\n\nThe court pointed toward exclusive distribution agreements Google has that allows it to be the default search engine.\n\n\"In exchange for revenue share, Google not only receives default placement at the key search access points, but its partners also agree not to preload any general search engine on the device,\" said the ruling. \"Thus, most devices in the United States come preloaded exclusively with Google. These distribution deals have forced rivals to find other ways to reach users.\"\n\nGoogle had paid $26 billion in 2021 alone to ensure its search engine would be the default.\n\n\"Ultimately, the court concludes that Google's exclusive distribution agreements have contributed to Google's maintenance of its monopoly power in two relevant markets: general search services and general search text advertising,\" said the ruling.\n\nThe court also said \"genuine competition in the market for general search\" could not be found by looking at the typical factors to determine competition.\n\n\"Time and again, Google's partners have concluded that it is financially infeasible to switch default GSEs or seek greater flexibility in search offerings because it would mean sacrificing the hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars that Google pays them as revenue share,\" said the court order. \"These are Fortune 500 companies, and they have nowhere else to turn other than Google.\"\n\nGoogle had argued it had the better product, which resulted in its dominance.\n\nThere are other companies including Amazon, Meta and Apple that have been sued by the U.S. government over antitrust laws.\n\nIt remains to be seen how this decision will impact those trials.", "source": {"uri": "deseret.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deseret News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deseret_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deseret News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mozilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Court order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fortune 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/MIEC4AHMZ5E45JXOLEHIJVZSEA.jpg?focal=0%2C0&auth=e7c79bc24dd03a0b91e826bd8f9a3ef310c228a802ea45906e6da93ec6b816d8&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

What judge's ruling means for you.", "body": "A federal judge has ruled that Google violated antitrust laws by creating a monopoly with its popular search engine.\n\nIn the most significant legal ruling against a major technology giant in more than two decades, a federal judge says Google illegally monopolized online search and advertising by paying companies like Apple and Samsung billions of dollars a year to install Google as the default search engine on smartphones and web browsers.\n\nBy monopolizing search queries on smartphones and browsers, Google abused its dominance in the search market, throttling competition and harming consumers, Mehta said in his 286-page decision. Google owes much of its more than $300 billion in annual revenue to search ads.\n\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nThe massive win for the Justice Department could fundamentally reshape how Google does business. It also could change how we use the internet and search for information.\n\nThe Justice Department filed antitrust charges during the final weeks of the Trump administration, making good on Donald Trump's pledge to challenge the runaway power of Big Tech. That mission continued during the Biden administration, which has been aggressive in pursuing antitrust cases.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" Attorney General Garland said in a statement. \"No company - no matter how large or influential - is above the law.\"\n\nThe case is the most significant victory for the Justice Department in a monopoly case in decades, said Notre Dame Law School professor Roger Alford, who served in the Justice Department's antitrust division. \"Not since Microsoft lost in the 1990s have we seen a case of this magnitude.\"\n\nGoogle said it would appeal the decision. \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Kent Walker, president of global affairs, said in a statement.\n\nShares in Google parent company Alphabet slipped following the judge's ruling. They closed down nearly 5% Monday, part of a broader tech stock selloff.\n\nIf upheld, the decision will be a \"major boost\" for other antitrust cases pending against Google as well as other major tech players like Amazon, Apple and Meta, said Loyola University Chicago School of Law professor Spencer Weber Waller.\n\nMonday's ruling did not include remedies. Remedies will be decided separately, likely after an appeal. One remedy could see Google losing its ability to strike device deals that have helped make its search engine so ubiquitous.\n\nDevising the right remedy is critical to restoring competition to the marketplace, Waller said.\n\n\"There are no fines or monetary penalties in these types of cases, but the court will have to decide whether Google should be broken up in some way. More likely, it will order Google to eliminate the exclusive contracts and licensing restrictions that have reinforced its monopoly position for years,\" he said.\n\nGoogle has argued that its distribution deals are common in the business world. It pays for its search engine to be on phones the way a food manufacturer pays to promote its products at eye level in a grocery store aisle.\n\nThe way Google sees it, if you don't like Google, you can switch the default search engine on your device. But people don't switch, Google says, because they prefer Google.\n\nChamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich said the antitrust ruling is a boost for Microsoft's Bing search engine.\n\n\"The biggest winner from today's ruling isn't consumers or little tech, it's Microsoft,\" Kovacevich said in a statement. \"Microsoft has underinvested in search for decades, but today's ruling opens the door to a court mandate of default deals for Bing. That's a slap in the face to consumers who chose Google because they think it's the best.\"\n\nDuring the 10-week trial, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified that Google's unchallenged dominance created a \"Google web.\"\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella has expressed concern that Microsoft's disadvantage would increase as artificial intelligence becomes a major factor in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said during the trial.", "source": {"uri": "jsonline.com", "dataType":

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled Monday, Aug. 5, 2024, that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet [...]\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies.\n\nThe highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century.\n\nAfter reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\nIt represents a major setback for Google and its parent, Alphabet Inc., which had steadfastly argued that its popularity stemmed from consumers' overwhelming desire to use a search engine so good at what it does that it has become synonymous with looking things up online. Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nGoogle almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may land in the U..S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out more than $20 billion annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nGoogle still faces other legal threats besides this one, both in the U.S. and abroad. any antitrust lawsuits brought against Google domestically and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.", "source": {"uri":

He said Google's dominance in the search market is evidence of its monopoly.\n\nGoogle \"enjoys an 89.2% share of the market for general search services, which increases to 94.9% on mobile devices,\" the ruling said.\n\nIt represents a major setback for Google and its parent, Alphabet Inc., which had steadfastly argued that its popularity stemmed from consumers' overwhelming desire to use a search engine so good at what it does that it has become synonymous with looking things up online. Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nKent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said the company intends to appeal Mehta's findings: \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available.\"\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nMehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nThe Consumer Choice Center, a lobbying group that has fought other attempts to rein in businesses, decried Mehta's decision as a step in the wrong direction. \"The United States is drifting toward the anti-tech posture of the European Union, a part of the world that makes almost nothing and penalizes successful American companies for their popularity,\" said Yael Ossowski, the center's deputy director.\n\nToday's Top Headlines Aiken could receive between 6-12 inches of rain from Hurricane Debby.

Corey Murphy shares insights with community leaders SRMC employee finds his career through senior capstone project\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from paying to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other devices. Or, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google. Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives.\"\n\nRegardless she added, a drawn-out appeals process will delay any immediate effects for both consumers and advertisers.\n\nLee Hepner, senior legal counsel for the American Economic Liberties Project, believes the tenor of Mehta's ruling makes it likely the judge will decide to prohibit Google from making default search deals and may even look at separating some of its different lines of business.\n\nThe appeals process could take as long as five years, predicted George Hay, a law professor at Cornell University who was the chief economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division for most of the 1970s. That lengthy process will enable Google to fend off the likelihood of Mehta banning default search agreements, Hay said, but it probably won't shield the company from class-action lawsuits citing the judge's findings that advertisers were gouged with monopolistic pricing.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nIf Mehta decides to limit or ban Google's default search deals, it could squeeze Apple's profits, too. Although parts of his decision were redacted to protect confidential business information, Mehta noted that Google paid Apple an estimated $20 billion in 2022, doubling from 2020. The judge also noted Apple has periodically considered building its own search technology, but backed off that after a 2018 analysis estimated the company would lose more than $12 billion in revenue during the first five years after a break-up with Google.\n\nGoogle's payments have helped Apple's steadily growing services division, which generated $85 billion in revenue during the company's last fiscal year. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Justice Department's antitrust division has recently taken on some of the biggest companies in the world. It sued Apple in March and in May announced a sweeping lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its owner, Live Nation Entertainment. Antitrust enforcers have also opened investigations into the roles Microsoft, Nvidia and OpenAI have played in the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nThe Biden administration has won some big cases, including blocking mergers of some of the world's biggest publishers as well as JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines. It's also had some notable setbacks, including in the sugar and healthcare industries.\n\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.\n\n-- --\n\nAssociated

The company has spent tens of billions of dollars on exclusive contracts to secure a dominant position as the world's default search provider on smartphones and web browsers.\n\nThose contracts have given it the scale to block out would-be rivals such as Microsoft's Bing and DuckDuckGo, the US government alleged in a historic antitrust lawsuit filed during the Trump administration.\n\nNow, said Mehta, that powerful position has led to anticompetitive behavior that must be stopped.\n\nSpecifically, Google's exclusive deals with Apple and other key players in the mobile ecosystem were anticompetitive, Mehta said. Google has also charged high prices in search advertising that reflect its monopoly power in search, he added.\n\nThose contracts have long meant that when users want to find information, Google is generally the easiest and quickest platform to go to, which in turn has fueled Google's massive online advertising business.\n\nWhile the court did not find that Google has a monopoly in search ads, the broader strokes of the opinion represent the first major decision in a string of US-government led competition lawsuits targeting Big Tech.

The company has spent tens of billions of dollars on exclusive contracts to secure a dominant position as the world's default search provider on smartphones and web browsers.\n\nThose contracts have given it the scale to block out would-be rivals such as Microsoft's Bing and DuckDuckGo, the US government alleged in a historic antitrust lawsuit filed during the Trump administration.\n\nNow, said Mehta, that powerful position has led to anticompetitive behavior that must be stopped.\n\nSpecifically, Google's exclusive deals with Apple and other key players in the mobile ecosystem were anticompetitive, Mehta said. Google has also charged high prices in search advertising that reflect its monopoly power in search, he added.\n\nThose contracts have long meant that when users want to find information, Google is generally the easiest and quickest platform to go to, which in turn has fueled Google's massive online advertising business.\n\nWhile the court did not find that Google has a monopoly in search ads, the broader strokes of the opinion represent the first major decision in a string of US-government led competition lawsuits targeting Big Tech.

The ruling hands the Justice Department its biggest victory in more than two decades in limiting the power of Big Tech companies to control and dominate the huge markets they have created.\n\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia wrote in his judgment on Monday.\n\nMehta ruled that the Justice Department was right in saying that Google violated antitrust law by forging restrictive contracts with Apple and other phone makers that required them to install Google as the default search engine on smartphones. He also decried other practices of the Alphabet Inc. unit that prevented its rivals from competing on an even playing field.\n\n\"This victory against Google is a historic win for the American people,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company - no matter how large or influential - is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nGoogle argued throughout the trial that its search engine faces competition from people looking for information in other places, such as on Amazon, TikTok, Reddit and increasingly on chatbots such as ChatGPT. In a statement after the ruling, Kent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said the court itself agreed that the company's search engine is the best option.\n\n\"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Walker said. \"Given this, and that people are increasingly looking for information in more and more ways, we plan to appeal.\"\n\nFederal antitrust law has not been invoked against a big tech company since the Justice Department sued Microsoft more than two decades ago.\n\nThe Google antitrust case has been closely watched in antitrust law circles as the first of a string of cases federal prosecutors have launched against high-tech giants. Antitrust enforcers argue that Big Tech has gotten too powerful and doesn't serve the public interest. Lawsuits have also been filed against Amazon, Meta and Apple.\n\nMehta wrote that Google has maintained its revenue growth and high operating profits by hiking its search advertising prices again and again, and that there was \"no evidence\" that market competition has been able to limit Google's ability to raise these prices.\n\n\"The only apparent constraint on Google's pricing decisions are potential advertiser outcry and bad publicity,\" Mehta wrote. \"Google, however, has managed to avoid those pitfalls by ramping up its pricing incrementally ... many advertisers do not even realize that Google is responsible for the changes in price.\"\n\nThe consequences of the ruling for Google and the broad online ecosystem are still unclear. The judge will rule on \"remedies\" for the case in the coming months. One potential measure would be for the court to block Google from paying to secure prime placement for its search engine on Apple's iPhones and other devices and web browsers. But that could work out in Google's favor, since its search engine might still be selected, and the company then wouldn't have to pay the billions of dollars it currently does to secure that placement. Such a ruling could also end up depriving Apple of a significant source of revenue.\n\nOther proposals from antitrust experts include requiring browsers and phone makers to directly ask consumers which search engine they would like to use when they first set up their device. This system has been tried before in Europe, where Google has still largely maintained its dominance.\n\nOthers have advocated for Google's different businesses to be broken up. The company not only controls the world's main search engine but also owns businesses that compete at different levels of the complex industry that helps connect advertisers to people online.\n\n\"The remedy must match the court's striking verdict,\" said Lee Hepner, a lawyer at the American Economic Liberties Project. \"At a minimum that means an end to Google's exclusive default agreements and breaking up business lines that have allowed Google to extend its monopoly into every corner of the internet.\"\n\nThe news of Mehta's decision was hailed by antitrust advocates.\n\n\"For a long time, Google was regarded as untouchable,\" Open Markets Institute Executive Director Barry Lynn, a veteran antitrust activist, said. \"This is the most powerful corporation perhaps in human history.\"\n\nLuther Lowe, head of public policy at Y Combinator and a longtime critic of Google, wrote on X that the ruling \"could significantly reshape the competitive landscape to benefit 'little tech' by reducing Google's gatekeeping power.\"\n\nIn his ruling, Mehta chastised Google for discouraging its employees and executives from saving text and email conversations to lower the potential that they could become evidence in court cases. The company had been criticized for doing the same in its court case with video game company Epic Games.\n\n\"The court is taken aback by the lengths to which Google goes to avoid creating a paper trail for regulators and litigants,\" Mehta wrote. Still, he declined to punish Google for doing so, saying the conduct didn't influence the court case.\n\n\"Any company that puts the onus on its employees to identify and preserve relevant evidence does so at its own peril. Google avoided sanctions in this case. It may not be so lucky in the next one,\" he wrote.\n\nThe case, U.S. et al v. Google, was filed in 2020 under the Trump administration, and prosecutors in the Biden administration's Justice Department took it to court in September 2023.\n\nThe nine-week trial at the E. Barrett Prettyman Courthouse in Washington saw appearances by senior industry executives, including Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella and Apple executives John Giannandrea and Eduardo Cue, to testify about Google's restrictive contracts and why it has been difficult for other companies to break into the market.\n\nProsecutors had argued that Google foreclosed market competition in search engines by requiring device makers who wanted to use Google's popular Android operating system to set Google search as the default. Google also pays Apple an estimated $19 billion a year to maintain Google search as the default search engine in iPhones and other Apple devices.\n\nA separate Justice Department antitrust lawsuit against Google, focused on its advertising technology, is awaiting trial in federal court in Virginia.\n\nGoogle is also facing antitrust scrutiny in other jurisdictions, including in the European Union, where antitrust regulators announced in March investigations into the company and others under the new Digital Markets Act, a new anti-monopoly law aimed at internet giants.", "source": {"uri":

Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nGoogle almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may land in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nAs expected, Mehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\n\"Advertisers consistently testified that shifting significant ad spending from Google to Bing would be ineffective (and unwise) because of Bing's lack of scale,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\n\"The court confirmed what almost everyone in the industry already knew: that Google is a monopoly and is abusing its power to harm consumers and enrich itself,\" said Roger Alford, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out billions annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said eMarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google. Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives.\"\n\nRegardless she added, a drawn-out appeals process will delay any immediate effects for both consumers and advertisers.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.\n\nKids, screen time and

For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department\u00b4s star witnesses (Microsoft/PA)\n\nJudge Mehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sort of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out more than 20 billion dollars (\u00a315 billion) annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices.\n\nAfter the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\nIf there is a significant shake-up, it could be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than 3 trillion dollars (\u00a32.3 trillion). At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about 2 trillion dollars (\u00a31.5 trillion).\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could damage Google at a critical point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that could be affected by Judge Mehta's decision.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured in more than 100 billion dollars in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Mr Nadella said at one point in his evidence. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nHe also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation does not get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with AI, I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" he told the court.\n\nGoogle still faces other legal threats in the US and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet of things"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/05/20/wire-88186371-1722887872-958_636x382.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

The legal wrangling could play out into next year, or even 2026.\n\nShares of Alphabet fell 4.5 per cent, on Monday, amid a broad decline in tech shares as the wider stock market cratered on recession fears.\n\nGoogle advertising was 77 per cent of Alphabet's total sales in 2023.\n\nAlphabet said it plans to appeal Mehta's ruling. \"This decision recognises that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Google said in a statement.\n\nUS Attorney General Merrick Garland called the ruling \"a historic win for the American people,\" adding that \"no company - no matter how large or influential - is above the law.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the \"pro-competition ruling is a victory for the American people,\" adding that \"Americans deserve an internet that is free, fair, and open for competition.\"\n\nGoogle paying to maintain monopoly\n\nMehta noted that Google had paid $26.3bn in 2021 alone to ensure that its search engine is the default on smartphones and browsers, and to keep its dominant market share.\n\n\"The default is extremely valuable real estate,\" Mehta wrote. \"Even if a new entrant were positioned from a quality standpoint to bid for the default when an agreement expires, such a firm could compete only if it were prepared to pay partners upwards of billions of dollars in revenue share and make them whole for any revenue shortfalls resulting from the change.\"\n\nHe added, \"Google, of course, recognises that losing defaults would dramatically impact its bottom line. For instance, Google has projected that losing the Safari default would result in a significant drop in queries and billions of dollars in lost revenues.\"\n\nThe ruling is the first major decision in a series of cases taking on alleged monopolies in Big Tech. This case, filed by the Trump administration, went before a judge from September to November of last year.\n\n\"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, who said a drawn-out legal process would delay any immediate effects for consumers.\n\nIn the past four years, federal antitrust regulators have also sued Meta Platforms, Amazon.com, and Apple, claiming the companies have illegally maintained monopolies.\n\nThose cases all began under the administration of former President Donald Trump.\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, said the fact that the case spanned administrations shows strong bipartisan support for antitrust enforcement.\n\n\"It's a huge victory for the American people that antitrust enforcement is alive and well when it comes to competition,\" she said. \"Google is a rampant monopolist.\"\n\nWhen it was filed in 2020, the Google search case was the first time in a generation that the US government accused a major corporation of an illegal monopoly. Microsoft settled with the Justice Department in 2004 over claims that it forced its Internet Explorer Web browser on Windows users.\n\nRead: Google's court loss to Epic Games may cost billions",

He said it makes Google a monopolist.\n\nThis is the result of a court case brought by the Department of Justice against Google. Apple isn't directly involved, though its annual income may have just dropped by $15 billion or $20 billion. Or more.\n\nDo an online search with the Safari web browser and it's handled by Google by default. Users can change to anther search engine, but they have to so so manually. Otherwise, it's Google.\n\nGoogle pays Apple an enormous amount for this. The exact amount isn't known outside the two companies, but it's been estimated to be at least $15 billion a year. Other companies get their payments too. The total coming out of Google was $26 billion in 2021.\n\nAnd Judge Amit Mehta ruled Monday that these payments are a violation of U.S. antitrust law.\n\n\"Google's distribution agreements foreclose a substantial portion of the general search services market and impair rivals' opportunities to compete,\" the judge said in his ruling.\n\nWhen someone does a search with Safari on an iPhone, the results they're shown includes ads. Google gets 76% of its revenue from advertising, and its search engine is critical to the business.\n\nThe wheels of justice grind slowly. Just because Judge Mehta ruled that \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" doesn't mean that Apple has stop making Google the default search engine on iPhone, Mac and iPad tomorrow.\n\nFirst off, the judge hasn't decided what remedies to take. He could simply order Google to stop paying Apple and others to be their default search engines. Alternatively, he could order Google broken up into component pieces, forcing its search engine and advertising business into separate companies. Or something else. He'll order whatever he thinks is most likely to break Google's monopoly and create real competition in internet search.\n\nAnd whatever decision he makes, expect Google to appeal. That's a process likely to stretch out for years.\n\nBut there are definite short-term consequences.

What judge's ruling means for you.", "body": "A federal judge has ruled that Google violated antitrust laws by creating a monopoly with its popular search engine.\n\nIn the most significant legal ruling against a major technology giant in more than two decades, a federal judge says Google illegally monopolized online search and advertising by paying companies like Apple and Samsung billions of dollars a year to install Google as the default search engine on smartphones and web browsers.\n\nBy monopolizing search queries on smartphones and browsers, Google abused its dominance in the search market, throttling competition and harming consumers, Mehta said in his 286-page decision. Google owes much of its more than $300 billion in annual revenue to search ads.\n\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nThe massive win for the Justice Department could fundamentally reshape how Google does business. It also could change how we use and experience the internet.\n\nThe Justice Department filed antitrust charges during the final weeks of the Trump administration, making good on Donald Trump's pledge to challenge the runaway power of Big Tech. That mission continued during the Biden administration, which has been aggressive in pursuing antitrust cases.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" Attorney General Garland said in a statement. \"No company - no matter how large or influential - is above the law.\"\n\nThe case is the most significant victory for the Justice Department in a monopoly case in decades, said Notre Dame Law School professor Roger Alford, who served in the Justice Department's antitrust division. \"Not since Microsoft lost in the 1990s have we seen a case of this magnitude.\"\n\nGoogle said it would appeal the decision. Kent Walker, president of global affairs, said the judge recognized that Google \"offers the best search engine.\"\n\n\"As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use,\" Walker said in a statement.\n\nIf upheld, the decision will be a \"major boost\" for other antitrust cases pending against Google as well as other major tech players like Amazon, Apple and Meta, said Loyola University Chicago School of Law professor Spencer Weber Waller.\n\nMonday's ruling did not include remedies. Remedies will be decided separately, likely after an appeal. One remedy could see Google losing its ability to strike device deals that have helped make its search engine so ubiquitous.\n\nDevising the right remedy is critical to restoring competition to the marketplace, Waller said.\n\n\"There are no fines or monetary penalties in these types of cases, but the court will have to decide whether Google should be broken up in some way. More likely, it will order Google to eliminate the exclusive contracts and licensing restrictions that have reinforced its monopoly position for years,\" he said.\n\nGoogle has argued that its distribution deals are common in the business world. It pays for its search engine to be on phones the way a food manufacturer pays to promote its products at eye level in a grocery store aisle.\n\nThe way Google sees it, if you don't like Google, you can switch the default search engine on your device. But people don't switch, Google says, because they prefer Google.\n\nChamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich said the antitrust ruling is a boost for Microsoft's Bing search engine.\n\n\"The biggest winner from today's ruling isn't consumers or little tech, it's Microsoft,\" Kovacevich said in a statement. \"Microsoft has underinvested in search for decades, but today's ruling opens the door to a court mandate of default deals for Bing. That's a slap in the face to consumers who chose Google because they think it's the best.\"\n\nDuring the 10-week trial, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified that Google's unchallenged dominance created a \"Google web.\"\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella has expressed concern that Microsoft's disadvantage would increase as artificial intelligence becomes a major factor in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said during the trial.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType":

How soon will AI drive profits?\n\nWASHINGTON -- A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies.\n\nThe highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Justice Department against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter century.\n\nAfter reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote in his 277-page ruling.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nReview: T-Pain deserved better than what fans gave him at the Mississippi Valley Fair John Deere lays off more than 300 in Moline and East Moline in latest round of cuts Timeline: Deere has cut 2,700 jobs in 10 months in Iowa and Illinois, 1,300 in Quad-Cities UAW releases statement on John Deere layoffs, says cuts 'kill good American jobs' Review: The bests and worsts of Friday at Hinterland Music Festival West Lake Okoboji home sells for state record $9.5M Davenport man arrested in connection with robbery, shooting incident Man accused of stealing car at gunpoint in Davenport Editorial: Davenport can change trajectory with new city administrator Mount Mercy and St. Ambrose to combine into single university Gannon Hanevold: The three strangest foods we found at the Mississippi Valley Fair Parents of murder victim angry with plea deal that offered reduced charge and prison sentence Driver of garbage truck struck by train in Scott County suffers minor injuries Five named to St. Ambrose Hall of Fame Prosecutors ask to dismiss cases against two men for 2023 killing in Davenport\n\nIt represents a major setback for Google and its parent, Alphabet Inc., which had steadfastly argued that its popularity stemmed from consumers' overwhelming desire to use a search engine so good at what it does that it has become synonymous with looking things up online. Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nGoogle almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may land in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nAs expected, Mehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\n\"Advertisers consistently testified that shifting significant ad spending from Google to Bing would be ineffective (and unwise) because of Bing's lack of scale,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\n\"The court confirmed what almost everyone in the industry already knew: that Google is a monopoly and is abusing its power to harm consumers and enrich itself,\" said Roger Alford, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out billions annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said eMarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google. Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives.\"\n\nRegardless she added, a drawn-out appeals process will delay any immediate effects for both consumers and advertisers.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.\n\nKids, screen time and

The Google case, filed by the administration of former President Donald Trump, went before a judge from September to November of last year.\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, said the fact that the case continued across administrations showed strong bipartisan support for antitrust enforcement.\n\n\"It's a huge victory for the American people that antitrust enforcement is alive and well when it comes to competition,\" she said. \"Google is a rampant monopolist.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centrepiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240bn in revenue last year.\n\nJustice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine - a lax approach which hurt users.\n\nMehta's ruling highlighted the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new mobile phones and electronic gadgets.

The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nJudge Amit Mehta, of the District of Columbia, said after considering the evidence and testimony from the nine-week bench trial last year that he reached the following conclusion: \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly. It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.\"\n\nGoogle is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly\n\nThe decision, which follows closing arguments in May, applies specifically to the impact Google's search distribution agreements have on the market for internet search services and search text ads.\n\nThe judge said Google's Search Ads 360 ad management platform, also challenged by the Justice Department, does not violate antitrust law. In addition, he declined to sanction Google for failing to preserve employee chat messages. The Justice Department in February urged the judge to sanction Google for destroying evidence.\n\nDonald Polden, former dean and professor of law at Santa Clara University, told The Register the outcome was not a surprise, despite other plausible scenarios.\n\n\"It seems clear that the judge did his homework and was able to parse through some of Google's conduct that was arguably pro-competitive,\" said Polden. \"But the basic framework of US monopoly law (like Microsoft, AT&T, etc) left the court with little opportunity to craft a decision around market dynamics, market share, and the company's heavy investment in exclusive dealing arrangements (generally more leniently viewed in antitrust analysis, than say price fixing) with a staggering market share.\"\n\nThe challenge for the court, Polden said, will be how the remedy is crafted.\n\n\"The federal courts (like in US v. Microsoft) struggled with what to do with an efficient monopolist with high consumer favorability or acceptance (break up is too inefficient and costly and most courts have a hard time re-juggling an entire industry), so we'll see what happens after the court sets up a briefing and argument schedule on remedies,\" he said.\n\nDespite the uncertainty about how market competition will be restored, the Open Markets Institute, a progressive advocacy group, welcomed the ruling.\n\n\"The Google Search ruling was a long time coming and is a historic win for our antitrust enforcers and internet users everywhere,\" said Barry Lynn, executive director of the Open Markets Institute, in a statement. \"The Justice Department brings Google back to court in September for its monopoly over search advertising markets and we expect to see similar results.\"\n\nThe News/Media Alliance, a media trade organization, also endorsed the ruling.\n\n\"We are incredibly pleased with the outcome today and applaud the Department of Justice for holding this dominant monopoly accountable for anticompetitive behavior in the digital advertising market, which has harmed countless businesses, including publishers of quality journalism,\" said Danielle Coffey, News/Media Alliance president and CEO, in a statement.\n\nThe Chamber of Progress, a tech trade group headed by former Google executive Adam Kovacevich, characterized the decision as a win for Microsoft.\n\n\"Microsoft has underinvested in search for decades, but today's ruling opens the door to a court mandate of default deals for Bing,\" said Kovacevich, CEO of the Chamber of Progress, in a statement. \"That's a slap in the face to consumers who chose Google because they think it's the best.\"\n\n... a slap in the face to consumers who chose Google because they think it's the best\n\nGoogle for years has been paying browser developers, smartphone makers, and wireless carriers to set Google Search as the default search engine. These payments show up on Google's financial statements under the line item titled \"Traffic Acquisition Costs.\"\n\nIn 2021, the Chrome titan paid more than $26 billion to ensure Google Search is set as the default, according to information revealed during the trial. Apple, for example, received between $18-$20 billion in 2020 for setting Google Search as the default search engine in Safari on Apple devices.\n\nThe effect of these payments has been to unlawfully limit competition, according to Judge Mehta.\n\nThe judge's 286-page ruling explains his reasoning in detail. One of the factors he cites is Google's admission that \"does not 'consider whether users will go to other specific search providers (general or otherwise) if it introduces a change to its Search product.'\"\n\nPointing to Google's own 2020 quality degradation study that found Google Search would not lose revenue if search quality got worse, Judge Mehta said, \"The fact that Google makes product changes without concern that its users might go elsewhere is something only a firm with monopoly power could do.\"\n\nGoogle isn't ready to accept the ruling and plans to take its case to a higher court.\n\n\"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" said Kent Walker, president of global affairs at Google, in a statement provided to The Register.\n\n\"We appreciate the court's finding that Google is 'the industry's highest quality search engine, which has earned Google the trust of hundreds of millions of daily users', that Google 'has long been the best search engine, particularly on mobile devices', 'has continued to innovate in search' and that 'Apple and Mozilla occasionally assess Google's search quality relative to its rivals and find Google's to be superior.'

The company has spent tens of billions of dollars on exclusive contracts to secure a dominant position as the world's default search provider on smartphones and web browsers.\n\nThose contracts have given it the scale to block out would-be rivals such as Microsoft's Bing and DuckDuckGo, the US government alleged in a historic antitrust lawsuit filed during the Trump administration.\n\nNow, said Mehta, that powerful position has led to anticompetitive behavior that must be stopped.\n\nSpecifically, Google's exclusive deals with Apple and other key players in the mobile ecosystem were anticompetitive, Mehta said. Google has also charged high prices in search advertising that reflect its monopoly power in search, he added.\n\nThose contracts have long meant that when users want to find information, Google is generally the easiest and quickest platform to go to, which in turn has fueled Google's massive online advertising business.\n\nWhile the court did not find that Google has a monopoly in search ads, the broader strokes of the opinion represent the first major decision in a string of US-government led competition lawsuits targeting Big Tech. This case in particular has been described as the biggest tech antitrust case since the US government's antitrust showdown with Microsoft at the turn of the millennium.\n\nNeither Google nor the Department of Justice immediately responded to a request for comment. This case is distinct from a separate antitrust suit brought by the Biden administration against Google in 2023 related to the company's advertising technology business. That case is expected to head to trial in early September.\n\nBut Monday's decision marks the second high-profile antitrust defeat for Google after a federal jury in California said in December that Google runs an illegal monopoly with its proprietary app store. The court in that case is still deliberating possible remedies.\n\nMehta's decision is expected to trigger a separate proceeding to determine what penalties Google will face -- after which point the company is also likely to file an appeal. But the ruling could ultimately upend how Google makes its search engine available to users, by impacting its ability to make the pricey deals with device makers and online service providers that were at the heart of the case.\n\nOther remedies could be on the table, too. For example, the court could force Google to implement a \"choice screen\" letting users know about other available search engines, Vanderbilt University law professor Rebecca Allensworth told CNN.\n\nThe company is also likely to face a monetary fine, although fines are \"not the primary way in which the American antitrust system enforces the law,\" because they tend to be a \"drop in the bucket for a huge, very profitable company like Google,\" she said.\n\nAt the time the lawsuit was first filed, US antitrust officials also did not rule out the possibility of a Google breakup, warning that Google's behavior could threaten future innovation or the rise of a Google successor.\n\nThe ruling could also be a bellwether for other, major tech antitrust cases that are moving through the courts, including against Apple and Amazon. Both Amazon and Apple have called the antitrust lawsuits filed against them \"wrong on the facts and the law.\"\n\nMehta's 277-page opinion follows a lengthy, multiweek trial last year that saw high-ranking executives from Google, as well as rivals and partners including Apple, Microsoft and others, testify in person. Much of the complex proceeding took place behind closed doors, reflecting the sensitive business information involved in the deals that powered Google's search dominance.\n\nAt trial, some critics warned that Google's search monopoly, which is fed by a never-ending supply of user search queries, would allow it to leapfrog to a dominant position in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe enormous amount of search data that is provided to Google through its default agreements can help Google train its artificial intelligence models to be better than anyone else's -- threatening to give Google an unassailable advantage in AI that would further entrench its power, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said from the witness stand.\n\nNadella's testimony highlighted how the government's case may have far-reaching effects that go beyond traditional search and may shape the future of a technology world leaders have described as potentially transformational.\n\nIf the court takes away Google's agreements that make it the default search engine on so many devices, it could hurt the company's core product at an extremely pivotal moment, Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf said in an emailed statement.\n\n\"Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives,\" Mitchell-Wolf said, referring to the growing threat to Google's search dominance posed by artificial intelligence search tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

He said Google's dominance in the search market is evidence of its monopoly.\n\nGoogle \"enjoys an 89.2% share of the market for general search services, which increases to 94.9% on mobile devices,\" the ruling said.\n\nIt represents a major setback for Google and its parent, Alphabet Inc., which had steadfastly argued that its popularity stemmed from consumers' overwhelming desire to use a search engine so good at what it does that it has become synonymous with looking things up online. Google's search engine processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nKent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said the company intends to appeal Mehta's findings.\n\n\"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Walker said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nMehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nThe Consumer Choice Center, a lobbying group that has fought other attempts to rein in businesses, decried Mehta's decision as a step in the wrong direction. \"The United States is drifting toward the anti-tech posture of the European Union, a part of the world that makes almost nothing and penalizes successful American companies for their popularity,\" said Yael Ossowski, the center's deputy director.\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape. He scheduled a Sept. 6 hearing to begin setting the stage for the next phase.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire, or preventing it from paying to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other devices. Or, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf.\n\nRegardless, she added, a drawn-out appeals process will delay any immediate effects for both consumers and advertisers.\n\nThe appeals process could take as long as five years, predicted George Hay, a law professor at Cornell University who was the chief economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division for most of the 1970s. That lengthy process will enable Google to fend off the likelihood of Mehta banning default search agreements, Hay said, but it probably won't shield the company from class-action lawsuits citing the judge's findings that advertisers were gouged with monopolistic pricing.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival, with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nIf Mehta decides to limit or ban Google's default search deals, it could squeeze Apple's profits, too. Although parts of his decision were redacted to protect confidential business information, Mehta noted that Google paid Apple an estimated $20 billion in 2022, doubling from 2020. The judge also noted Apple has periodically considered building its own search technology, but backed off that after a 2018 analysis estimated the company would lose more than $12 billion in revenue during the first five years after a break-up with Google.\n\nGoogle's payments have helped Apple's steadily growing services division, which generated $85 billion in revenue during the company's last fiscal year. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Justice Department's antitrust division has recently taken on some of the biggest companies in the world. It sued Apple in March and in May announced a sweeping lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its owner, Live Nation Entertainment. Antitrust enforcers have also opened investigations into the roles Microsoft, Nvidia and OpenAI have played in the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nThe Biden administration has won some big cases, including blocking mergers of some of the world's biggest publishers as well as JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines. It's also had some notable setbacks, including in the sugar and healthcare industries.\n\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n-- --\n\nLiedtke reported from San Ramon, California.

This includes partnerships with Apple and Samsung to make Google the default search engine on their products (via DOJ):\n\nGoogle's dominance has gone unchallenged for well over a decade. In 2009, 80% of all search queries in the United States already went through Google. That number has only grown. By 2020, it was nearly 90%, and even higher on mobile devices at almost 95%. The second-place search engine, Microsoft's Bing, sees roughly 6% of all search queries -- 84% fewer than Google.\n\nGoogle has not achieved market dominance by happenstance. It has hired thousands of highly skilled engineers, innovated consistently, and made shrewd business decisions. The result is the industry's highest quality search engine, which has earned Google the trust of hundreds of millions of daily users.\n\nBut Google also has a major, largely unseen advantage over its rivals: default distribution. Most users access a general search engine through a browser (like Apple's Safari) or a search widget that comes preloaded on a mobile device. Those search access points are preset with a \"default\" search engine. The default is extremely valuable real estate.\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) brought forward the lawsuit in late 2020 and filed two separate lawsuits alleging that the agreements and other conduct violated federal antitrust law. The Justice Department repeatedly said that Google's search engine conducted nearly 90 percent of all web searches. The tech company has denied this.\n\nThis, and the company spends billions of dollars to be the automatic search engine on many services, as already mentioned.\n\nThe New York Times reported that this ruling is likely to influence other lawsuits brought forward against Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta.\n\nMehta will now decide if Google will be forced to change the way it operates or if it will sell off parts of its business.\n\nMultiple outlets noted that this is the biggest tech antitrust case since the U.S. government's lawsuit with Microsoft over 20 years ago.\n\nIn a statement to Fox Business, Google President of Global Affairs Kent Walker said: \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available. We appreciate the Court's finding that Google is 'the industry's highest quality search engine, which has earned Google the trust of hundreds of millions of daily users', that Google 'has long been the best search engine, particularly on mobile devices', 'has continued to innovate in search' and that 'Apple and Mozilla occasionally assess Google's search quality relative to its rivals and find Google's to be superior.'\"\n\n\"Given this, and that people are increasingly looking for information in more and more ways, we plan to appeal,\" Walker added in the statement to Fox. \"As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use.\"", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "madeline_leesman@townhall.com", "name": "Madeline Leesman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sherman Antitrust Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mozilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2018/305/2f8a55f9-a0c2-4d3a-95a1-06ece493baf4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Reuters-Yonhap\n\nA U.S. judge ruled on Monday that Google violated antitrust law, spending billions of dollars to create an illegal monopoly and become the world's default search engine, the first big win for federal authorities taking on Big Tech's market dominance.\n\nThe ruling paves the way for a second trial to determine potential fixes, possibly including a breakup of Google parent Alphabet, which would change the landscape of the online advertising world that Google has dominated for years.\n\nIt is also a green light to aggressive U.S. antitrust enforcers prosecuting Big Tech, a sector that has been under fire from across the political spectrum.\n\n\"The court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, Washington, D.C., wrote. Google controls about 90 percent of the online search market and 95 percent on smartphones.\n\nThe \"remedy\" phase could be lengthy, followed by potential appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court. The legal wrangling could play out into next year, or even 2026.\n\nShares of Alphabet fell 4.5 percent on Monday amid a broad decline in tech shares as the wider stock market cratered on recession fears. Google advertising was 77 percent of Alphabet's total sales in 2023.\n\nAlphabet said it plans to appeal Mehta's ruling. \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Google said in a statement.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland called the ruling \"a historic win for the American people,\" adding that \"no company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the \"pro-competition ruling is a victory for the American people,\" adding that \"Americans deserve an internet that is free, fair, and open for competition.\"\n\nVarious Google logos are displayed on a Google search, Sept. 11, 2023, in New York. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled, Aug. 5, that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies. AP-Yonhap\n\nBillions paid\n\nMehta noted that Google had paid $26.3 billion in 2021 alone to ensure that its search engine is the default on smartphones and browsers, and to keep its dominant market share.\n\n\"The default is extremely valuable real estate,\" Mehta wrote. \"Even if a new entrant were positioned from a quality standpoint to bid for the default when an agreement expires, such a firm could compete only if it were prepared to pay partners upwards of billions of dollars in revenue share and make them whole for any revenue shortfalls resulting from the change.\"\n\nHe added, \"Google, of course, recognizes that losing defaults would dramatically impact its bottom line. For instance, Google has projected that losing the Safari default would result in a significant drop in queries and billions of dollars in lost revenues.\" The ruling is the first major decision in a series of cases taking on alleged monopolies in Big Tech. This case, filed by the Trump administration, went before a judge from September to November of last year.\n\n\"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, who said a drawn-out legal process would delay any immediate effects for consumers.\n\nIn the past four years, federal antitrust regulators have also sued Meta Platforms, Amazon.com and Apple, claiming the companies have illegally maintained monopolies. Those cases all began under the administration of former President Donald Trump.\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, said the fact that the case spanned administrations shows strong bipartisan support for antitrust enforcement.\n\n\"It's a huge victory for the American people that antitrust enforcement is alive and well when it comes to competition,\" she said. \"Google is a rampant monopolist.\"\n\nWhen it was filed in 2020, the Google search case was the first time in a generation that the U.S. government accused a major corporation of an illegal monopoly. Microsoft settled with the Justice Department in 2004 over claims that it forced its Internet Explorer Web browser on Windows users.

That conduct has allowed Google to earn monopoly profits,\" he added.\n\nThe ruling came in a lawsuit brought in 2020 by the federal Department of Justice and a coalition of states. They accused Google of violating anti-monopoly laws in several ways, including by obtaining dominance in search by contracting to be the default search engine in Mozilla's Firefox browser and Apple's Safari browser, and to have its search engine pre-installed on Android smartphones.\n\nGoogle fought the charges on several grounds. Among other arguments, the company said its search deals reflected that its search engine was better than ones operated by other companies.\n\nGoogle specifically noted that Mozilla -- which began using Google as the default search for the Firefox browser in 2004 -- changed the default to Yahoo from 2014, but reverted to Google in 2017. Google told Mehta that Mozilla saw a decline in usage of the default search functionality, and in the number of Firefox users, when Yahoo was the default search engine.\n\nMehta agreed with Google that its search engine was superior, but also said the company \"thwarted true competition by foreclosing its rivals from the most effective channels of search distribution.\"\n\nGoogle \"has long been the best search engine, particularly on mobile devices,\" Mehta wrote, adding that Google's partners \"value its quality, and they continue to select Google as the default because its search engine provides the best bet for monetizing queries.\"\n\nBut he also said that even if Google initially gained dominance due to its superiority, the distribution agreements helped the company to maintain that dominance.\n\nGoogle \"has a major, largely unseen advantage over its rivals: default distribution,\" Mehta wrote, adding that in 2021 the company paid $26 billion to distributors via revenue sharing agreements.\n\n\"Because many users simply stick to searching with the default, Google receives billions of queries every day through those access points. Google derives extraordinary volumes of user data from such searches,\" he added. \"It then uses that information to improve search quality.\"\n\nGoogle says it plans to appeal.\n\n\"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Kent Walker, global affairs president, stated Monday.\n\nIn addition to arguing that the distribution deals didn't violate antitrust laws, Google also unsuccessfully argued to Mehta that there was no relevant antitrust market for \"general search services\" -- meaning search engines like itself and Bing.\n\nInstead, Google said, the market should be defined as companies that offer \"query responses.\" That proposed market would include Amazon, Yelp and social media companies.\n\nMehta rejected that proposed definition, writing that shopping sites or walled gardens like TikTok or Instagram don't substitute for search engines.\n\nThe judge hasn't yet indicated what remedy he may impose, but the tech industry funded think tank Chamber of Progress speculated that the ruling could result in deals that favor Microsoft's Bing.\n\n\"The biggest winner from today's ruling isn't consumers or little tech, it's Microsoft,\" Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich, a former Google employee, stated Monday.\n\nHe added that the ruling \"opens the door to a court mandate of default deals for Bing.\"\n\nBut others, including the advocacy group Public Knowledge, praised Mehta's decision. Public Knowledge policy counsel Elise Phillips stated Monday that the ruling \"sets the stage to ensure that Google operates on a level playing field, creating an environment for healthier market competition and innovation that responds to the competitive pressure of rivals and consumer needs.\"", "source": {"uri": "mediapost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MediaPost"}, "authors": [{"uri": "wendy_davis@mediapost.com", "name": "Wendy Davis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firefox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mozilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_of_Progress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chamber of Progress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Closed platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_sharing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revenue sharing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Knowledge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public Knowledge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yelp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yelp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/dam/cropped/2024/06/20/googlegavel_51zH5RP.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nGoogle almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may land in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nAs expected, Mehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\n\"Advertisers consistently testified that shifting significant ad spending from Google to Bing would be ineffective (and unwise) because of Bing's lack of scale,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\n\"The court confirmed what almost everyone in the industry already knew: that Google is a monopoly and is abusing its power to harm consumers and enrich itself,\" said Roger Alford, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out billions annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said eMarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google. Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives.\"\n\nRegardless she added, a drawn-out appeals process will delay any immediate effects for both consumers and advertisers.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.\n\nKids, screen time and

A judge has ruled that the company has violated antitrust laws with its online search services, stating the company made illegal moves to keep its monopoly on internet search.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Google tried to keep its massive market share for internet search by paying companies like Apple and Samsung tons of money to make Google the default search engine on their mobile phones. Judge Mehta added in his decision, \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\"\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by the US Department of Justice, which led to a 10-week trial beginning in September 2023. The DOJ stated that in addition to payments made to Apple and Samsung, Google also forced other Android-based companies to install certain apps, including Search, before they could fully use Google's Android operating system.\n\nDuring the trial, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella took the stand. He testified that the company tried to get Apple to switch its default search engine from Google to Microsoft's Bing for its iPhones. Nadella claimed Microsoft was willing to lose billions of dollars for such an agreement and would have even agreed to hide the Bing brand name in Apple users' search engines.\n\nSo far, Google has yet to comment on the ruling by Judge Mehta. The next phase of this court battle will be to set up the remedies that Google will have to deal with to solve the antitrust ruling against it. Some possible solutions include ending the kinds of deals that Google made with companies like Apple and Samsung. Another and more drastic remedy would be for Google's search part to be spun off into its own stand-alone business. Google will almost certainly file an appeal for this decision.", "source": {"uri": "neowin.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Neowin"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_callaham@neowin.net", "name": "John Callaham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the District of Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_spin-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corporate spin-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2020/04/1587624429_google_5_story.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The company has spent tens of billions of dollars on exclusive contracts to secure a dominant position as the world's default search provider on smartphones and web browsers.\n\nThose contracts have given it the scale to block out would-be rivals such as Microsoft's Bing and DuckDuckGo, the US government alleged in a historic antitrust lawsuit filed during the Trump administration.\n\nNow, said Mehta, that powerful position has led to anticompetitive behavior that must be stopped.\n\nSpecifically, Google's exclusive deals with Apple and other key players in the mobile ecosystem were anticompetitive, Mehta said. Google has also charged high prices in search advertising that reflect its monopoly power in search, he added.\n\nThose contracts have long meant that when users want to find information, Google is generally the easiest and quickest platform to go to, which in turn has fueled Google's massive online advertising business.\n\nWhile the court did not find that Google has a monopoly in search ads, the broader strokes of the opinion represent the first major decision in a string of US-government led competition lawsuits targeting Big Tech. This case in particular has been described as the biggest tech antitrust case since the US government's antitrust showdown with Microsoft at the turn of the millennium.\n\nNeither Google nor the Department of Justice immediately responded to a request for comment. This case is distinct from a separate antitrust suit brought by the Biden administration against Google in 2023 related to the company's advertising technology business. That case is expected to head to trial in early September.\n\nBut Monday's decision marks the second high-profile antitrust defeat for Google after a federal jury in California said in December that Google runs an illegal monopoly with its proprietary app store. The court in that case is still deliberating possible remedies.\n\nPossible penalties\n\nMehta's decision is expected to trigger a separate proceeding to determine what penalties Google will face -- after which point the company is also likely to file an appeal. But the ruling could ultimately upend how Google makes its search engine available to users, by impacting its ability to make the pricey deals with device makers and online service providers that were at the heart of the case.\n\nOther remedies could be on the table, too. For example, the court could force Google to implement a \"choice screen\" letting users know about other available search engines, Vanderbilt University law professor Rebecca Allensworth told CNN.\n\nThe company is also likely to face a monetary fine, although fines are \"not the primary way in which the American antitrust system enforces the law,\" because they tend to be a \"drop in the bucket for a huge, very profitable company like Google,\" she said.\n\nAt the time the lawsuit was first filed, US antitrust officials also did not rule out the possibility of a Google breakup, warning that Google's behavior could threaten future innovation or the rise of a Google successor.\n\nThe ruling could also be a bellwether for other, major tech antitrust cases that are moving through the courts, including against Apple and Amazon. Both Amazon and Apple have called the antitrust lawsuits filed against them \"wrong on the facts and the law.\"\n\nArtificial intelligence at stake\n\nMehta's 277-page opinion follows a lengthy, multiweek trial last year that saw high-ranking executives from Google, as well as rivals and partners including Apple, Microsoft and others, testify in person. Much of the complex proceeding took place behind closed doors, reflecting the sensitive business information involved in the deals that powered Google's search dominance.\n\nAt trial, some critics warned that Google's search monopoly, which is fed by a never-ending supply of user search queries, would allow it to leapfrog to a dominant position in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe enormous amount of search data that is provided to Google through its default agreements can help Google train its artificial intelligence models to be better than anyone else's -- threatening to give Google an unassailable advantage in AI that would further entrench its power, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said from the witness stand.\n\nNadella's testimony highlighted how the government's case may have far-reaching effects that go beyond traditional search and may shape the future of a technology world leaders have described as potentially transformational.\n\nIf the court takes away Google's agreements that make it the default search engine on so many devices, it could hurt the company's core product at an extremely pivotal moment, Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf said in an emailed statement.\n\n\"Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives,\" Mitchell-Wolf said, referring to the growing threat to Google's search dominance posed by artificial intelligence search tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nGoogle almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may land in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nAs expected, Mehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\n\"Advertisers consistently testified that shifting significant ad spending from Google to Bing would be ineffective (and unwise) because of Bing's lack of scale,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\n\"The court confirmed what almost everyone in the industry already knew: that Google is a monopoly and is abusing its power to harm consumers and enrich itself,\" said Roger Alford, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out billions annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said eMarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google. Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives.\"\n\nRegardless she added, a drawn-out appeals process will delay any immediate effects for both consumers and advertisers.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.\n\nKids, screen time and despair: An expert in the economics of happiness echoes psychologists' warnings about tech Kids, screen time and despair: An expert in the economics of happiness echoes psychologists' warnings about tech Greater number of young people are reporting despair Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nThe business news you need\n\nGet the latest local business news delivered FREE to your inbox weekly.\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "pantagraph.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pantagraph.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_barakat@pantagraph.com", "name": "Matthew Barakat", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomington,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bloomington, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bloomington, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Salvation Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Mehta held Monday that \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\"\n\nAlthough the ruling doesn't compel Google to take any immediate action, it sets the table for potential changes that could significantly alter how consumers search for information online and how businesses reach those consumers.\n\nMore from Sportico.com\n\nThat's true of sports fans, teams, leagues, athletes, NIL influencers, sneaker businesses, media companies, marketing firms and numerous others with sizable stakes in athletics. They could all see changes in their online experience that pose economic repercussions.\n\nU.S. v. Google centers on the Justice Department's contention that Google wrongfully uses exclusive agreements to secure default status \"on nearly all desktop and mobile devices in the United States.\" Google, the DOJ maintains, is a monopoly in three markets: general search services, search advertising and general search text advertising.\n\nLast September, Mehta presided over a bench trial (no jury) that lasted nine weeks. The trial included dozens of witnesses, numerous experts and over 3,500 evidence exhibits. Mehta has praised the lawyering as \"first-rate throughout\" in a case that began when the DOJ and 14 states sued in 2020 (a group of other states filed their own lawsuit, which is incorporated into Mehta's ruling).\n\nMuch of the case concerns Google using contracts to ensure its \"out-of-the-box default search setting.\" Google has signed distribution contracts with browser developers, wireless carriers and mobile device companies to obtain status and, Mehta found, suppress competition.\n\nFor example, Google is the default search engine for Safari and Firefox browsers. The Google Search Widget, which is cumbersome to replace, is also on \"all android devices,\" and for all devices except Samsung, Google's Chrome \"is preloaded as the exclusive browser.\" This strategy for exclusivity, Mehta reasoned, effectively blocks Google's rivals.\n\nSearch engine data mentioned in Mehta's 277-page opinion similarly paints a stark picture. In 2020, 89.2% of search queries and 94.9% of those made on mobile devices, went through Google. Microsoft's Bing placed a distant second place with a meager 6%.\n\nMehta conceded that Google's market dominance is partly a reflection of merit and sound judgment. He acknowledged the company's \"highly skilled engineers\" as well as its consistent innovation and \"shrewd business decisions\" as playing instrumental roles.\n\nBut more problematic to the judge is Google's acquisition of \"default distribution,\" meaning Google's strategy of making its search engine the default or preloaded option. Mehta noted that gaining default status is invaluable since \"many users simply stick to searching with the default\" rather than trying another one. Google then utilizes search data, including through users' search histories and activities, to refine its engine to further disadvantage rivals. The company also uses its search engine dominance to secure massive revenues in advertising, with a roughly 210% increase from about $47 billion in 2014 to approximately $146 billion in 2021.\n\nMehta concluded Google has monopoly power over the markets for general search services and general search text ads, including charging higher-than-market prices for general search text ads. On the other hand, Mehta sided with Google that the company lacks monopoly power in the market for search advertising. He reached several other conclusions of law supportive of the company.\n\nStill, Mehta's major finding is that Google violates antitrust law. The 53-year-old judge added he was \"taken aback by the lengths to which Google goes to avoid creating a paper trail for regulators and litigants\" and surmised Google \"trained its employees, rather effectively, not to create 'bad' evidence.\"\n\nMehta has ordered the parties to submit a joint status report by Sept. 4 for determination of a schedule for proceedings regarding remedies. They will appear before the D.C.-based Mehta on Sept. 6.\n\nMehta could order a range of remedies that, by injunction, limit Google's use of exclusive contracts or even require company assets be divested. The DOJ says that the \"central goals of remedies\" in monopoly cases \"are to terminate the defendant's unlawful conduct, prevent its recurrence, and re-establish the opportunity for competition in the affected market.\"\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said Monday. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law.\"\n\nKent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, released a statement to media noting that Mehta's ruling \"recognizes that Google offers the best search engine,\" though Walker acknowledged the judge concluded \"we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available.\" Google is expected to appeal Metha's ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. With Google found to be a monopolist, the Department of Justice, states and other parties could bring additional litigation against Google.\n\nAs Sportico has explained, a downsizing of Google's presence could alter sports leagues' marketing strategies and partnerships with technology companies. Ticket, apparel and sneaker companies, including those in partnership with leagues and players, pay for ads to appear on the first page of Google searches or with prominence on Google-owned YouTube. Media companies also try to \"game\" Google results to increase hits to stories. All these strategies could be altered with a search market where Bing or other search engines have larger presences.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sherman Antitrust Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bench_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bench trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google Chrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_network_operator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile network operator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firefox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_District_of_Columbia_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Internet_Marketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Internet Marketing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ufo5Nglb0VSkV7s5sTtd_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/sportico_165/e98005ae4421054e2c4dcb8bd6fadb58", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-04", "textStart": 3996, "textEnd": 4003}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-06", "textStart": 4120, "textEnd": 4127}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

That was what a federal judge ruled on Monday in a landmark case that may lead the company to significantly change its operations.\n\n\"Google is a monopolist and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" said the court, finding the tech company violated antitrust laws.\n\nThe decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, which Google can appeal, may mean there will be additional legal proceedings to determine what the company needs to do in order to change to no longer violate antitrust.\n\nThe case was brought forward after the Justice Department and several states sued, alleging Google dominated search via illegally maintaining its monopoly.\n\nIn the ruling, the judge said the offense of monopolization requires proof in two areas: 1) a company does hold a monopoly and 2) willfully maintaining that power outside of accident or business acumen or having a superior product.\n\nThe court pointed toward exclusive distribution agreements Google has that allows it to be the default search engine.\n\n\"In exchange for revenue share, Google not only receives default placement at the key search access points, but its partners also agree not to preload any general search engine on the device,\" said the ruling. \"Thus, most devices in the United States come preloaded exclusively with Google.

Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nGoogle almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may land in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nAs expected, Mehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\n\"Advertisers consistently testified that shifting significant ad spending from Google to Bing would be ineffective (and unwise) because of Bing's lack of scale,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\n\"The court confirmed what almost everyone in the industry already knew: that Google is a monopoly and is abusing its power to harm consumers and enrich itself,\" said Roger Alford, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out billions annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said eMarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google. Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives.\"\n\nRegardless she added, a drawn-out appeals process will delay any immediate effects for both consumers and advertisers.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.\n\nKids, screen time and

Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.\n\nKids, screen time and

The decision came down Monday in US District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nThis blockbuster case has been ongoing for several years, with the trial having begun last September. The US Department of Justice argued that Google had become an illegal monopoly, and in a 277-page ruling, Judge Amit P. Mehta agreed.\n\nAs the New York Times reports, Mehta ruled that Google had cultivated and maintained a monopoly over internet search in part by paying companies like Samsung and Apple to make its search engine the default in their mobile browsers.\n\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nThis is the first antitrust case against a big tech company since the government's case against Microsoft over two decades ago, and it could lead to Google/Alphabet needing to make major changes to how it does business.\n\nThe ruling further finds that Google has an illegal monopoly over the text-based ads that appear in its search results. Mehta found that Google was able to inflate the prices of search ads because of this monopoly.\n\nPer the Times, Mehta will now recommend a remedy for the company, with the possibility of having to break apart its search or advertising businesses.\n\nIn a statement, Jonathan Kanter, who leads the Justice Department's antitrust division, said, \"This landmark decision holds Google accountable. It paves the path for innovation for generations to come and protects access to information for all Americans.\"\n\nGoogle responded to the ruling, with the company's VP of global affairs, Kent Walker, trying to give it a positive spin.\n\n\"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available. As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use,\" Walker said.\n\nThe ruling is a major win for competitors like Microsoft, whose Bing search engine has for over a decade tried to carve out a share of the search space, with little traction.", "source": {"uri": "sfist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SFist - San Francisco News, Restaurants, Events, & Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the District of Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Kanter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Kanter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice_Antitrust_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1529612700005-e35377bf1415?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE0fHxnb29nbGV8ZW58MHx8fHwxNzIyODQ2NTYxfDA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

It marks the Justice Department's first victory over a monopoly in over 20 years.\n\nThe Justice Department sued Google over its control of roughly 90% of the online search market - an amount that rises to 95% on smartphones. Judge Mehta noted that Google paid $26.3 billion in 2021 alone to ensure that its search engine remained the default option on web browsers and smartphones to keep its dominant market share.\n\n\"The court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nJUSTICE DEPARTMENT ACCUSES GOOGLE OF UNFAIRLY DOMINATING ONLINE SEARCHES IN LANDMARK TRIAL\n\nMehta's ruling paves the way for a second trial to determine potential remedies for Google's monopoly, like requiring the company to stop paying billions of dollars annually to smartphone makers to keep its search engine as the default option.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\n\"The default is extremely valuable real estate... Even if a new entrant were positioned from a quality standpoint to bid for the default when an agreement expires, such a firm could compete only if it were prepared to pay partners upwards of billions of dollars in revenue share and make them whole for any revenue shortfalls resulting from the change,\" Mehta wrote.\n\n\"Google, of course, recognizes that losing defaults would dramatically impact its bottom line. For instance, Google has projected that losing the Safari default would result in a significant drop in queries and billions of dollars in lost revenues,\" he added.\n\nAI GIANT NVIDIA FACES CALLS FROM PROGRESSIVE GROUPS FOR AN ANTITRUST PROBE\n\nGoogle President of Global Affairs Kent Walker said in a statement provided to FOX Business: \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available. We appreciate the Court's finding that Google is 'the industry's highest quality search engine, which has earned Google the trust of hundreds of millions of daily users', that Google 'has long been the best search engine, particularly on mobile devices', 'has continued to innovate in search' and that 'Apple and Mozilla occasionally assess Google's search quality relative to its rivals and find Google's to be superior.'\"\n\n\"Given this, and that people are increasingly looking for information in more and more ways, we plan to appeal,\" Walker added. \"As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use.\"\n\nThe Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nEU WANTS GOOGLE AD BUSINESS BROKEN UP OVER COMPETITION ISSUES\n\nThe decision is the first major court ruling against Big Tech firms in a series of cases alleging that those companies have allegedly engaged in monopolistic business practices.\n\nIn the last four years, federal antitrust regulators have also filed lawsuits against Meta - the parent of Facebook and Instagram - as well as Amazon and Apple over allegations the Big Tech companies have illegally maintained monopolies. Another case against Google over its advertising technology is scheduled to go to trial in September.\n\nWhen the Google search case was filed in 2020, it marked the first time in a generation that the federal government accused a major corporation of maintaining an illegal monopoly.\n\nMicrosoft settled the Justice Department's suit, which accused the company of forcing its Internet Explorer web browser on Windows users, in 2004.\n\nOriginal article source: Federal judge rules Google violated antitrust law", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The company has spent tens of billions of dollars on exclusive contracts to secure a dominant position as the world's default search provider on smartphones and web browsers.\n\nThose contracts have given it the scale to block out would-be rivals such as Microsoft's Bing and DuckDuckGo, the US government alleged in a historic antitrust lawsuit filed during the Trump administration.\n\nNow, said Mehta, that powerful position has led to anticompetitive behavior that must be stopped.\n\nSpecifically, Google's exclusive deals with Apple and other key players in the mobile ecosystem were anticompetitive, Mehta said. Google has also charged high prices in search advertising that reflect its monopoly power in search, he added.\n\nThose contracts have long meant that when users want to find information, Google is generally the easiest and quickest platform to go to, which in turn has fueled Google's massive online advertising business.\n\nWhile the court did not find that Google has a monopoly in search ads, the broader strokes of the opinion represent the first major decision in a string of US-government led competition lawsuits targeting Big Tech. This case in particular has been described as the biggest tech antitrust case since the US government's antitrust showdown with Microsoft at the turn of the millennium.\n\nNeither Google nor the Department of Justice immediately responded to a request for comment. This case is distinct from a separate antitrust suit brought by the Biden administration against Google in 2023 related to the company's advertising technology business. That case is expected to head to trial in early September.\n\nBut Monday's decision marks the second high-profile antitrust defeat for Google after a federal jury in California said in December that Google runs an illegal monopoly with its proprietary app store. The court in that case is still deliberating possible remedies.\n\nMehta's decision is expected to trigger a separate proceeding to determine what penalties Google will face -- and the company is also likely to file an appeal. But the ruling could ultimately upend how Google makes its search engine available to users, by impacting its ability to make the pricey deals with device makers and online service providers that were at the heart of the case.\n\nIf the court takes away Google's agreements that make it the default search engine on so many devices it could hurt the company's core product at an extremely pivotal moment, Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf said in an emailed statement.\n\n\"Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives,\" Mitchell-Wolf said, referring to the growing threat to Google's search dominance posed by artificial intelligence search tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nAt the time the lawsuit was first filed, US antitrust officials also did not rule out the possibility of a Google breakup, warning that Google's behavior could threaten future innovation or the rise of a Google successor.\n\nThe ruling could also be a bellwether for other, major tech antitrust cases that are moving through the courts, including against Apple and Amazon. Both Amazon and Apple have called the antitrust lawsuits filed against them \"wrong on the facts and the law.\"\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Judge Mehta also criticized the company's contracts with Apple and other tech players that require them to use Google as the default search engine in their products.\n\nAlso: Google Search kills infinite scroll. Here's what it means for you - and websites\n\nFollowing the judge's ruling, the Antitrust Division of the US DOJ issued a statement from Attorney General Merrick Garland and Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" Garland said. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nCalling this a landmark decision that holds Google accountable, Kanter said: \"It paves the path for innovation for generations to come and protects access to information for all Americans.\"\n\nIn a response posted on X, Google Global Affairs President Kent Walker announced the company's intention to appeal the decision:\n\n\"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available. We appreciate the Court's finding that Google is 'the industry's highest quality search engine, which has earned Google the trust of hundreds of millions of daily users,' that Google 'has long been the best search engine, particularly on mobile devices,' 'has continued to innovate in search' and that 'Apple and Mozilla occasionally assess Google's search quality relative to its rivals and find Google's to be superior.' Given this, and that people are increasingly looking for information in more and more ways, we plan to appeal.\"\n\nDespite finding Google culpable of violating antitrust laws, the judge didn't suggest any penalties, at least for now.

The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nMehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nThe Consumer Choice Center, a lobbying group that has fought other attempts to rein in businesses, decried Mehta's decision as a step in the wrong direction. \"The United States is drifting toward the anti-tech posture of the European Union, a part of the world that makes almost nothing and penalizes successful American companies for their popularity,\" said Yael Ossowski, the center's deputy director.\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape. He scheduled a Sept. 6 hearing to begin setting the stage for the next phase.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire, or preventing it from paying to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other devices. Or, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf.\n\nRegardless, she added, a drawn-out appeals process will delay any immediate effects for both consumers and advertisers.\n\nThe appeals process could take as long as five years, predicted George Hay, a law professor at Cornell University who was the chief economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division for most of the 1970s. That lengthy process will enable Google to fend off the likelihood of Mehta banning default search agreements, Hay said, but it probably won't shield the company from class-action lawsuits citing the judge's findings that advertisers were gouged with monopolistic pricing.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival, with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nIf Mehta decides to limit or ban Google's default search deals, it could squeeze Apple's profits, too. Although parts of his decision were redacted to protect confidential business information, Mehta noted that Google paid Apple an estimated $20 billion in 2022, doubling from 2020. The judge also noted Apple has periodically considered building its own search technology, but backed off that after a 2018 analysis estimated the company would lose more than $12 billion in revenue during the first five years after a break-up with Google.\n\nGoogle's payments have helped Apple's steadily growing services division, which generated $85 billion in revenue during the company's last fiscal year. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Justice Department's antitrust division has recently taken on some of the biggest companies in the world. It sued Apple in March and in May announced a sweeping lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its owner, Live Nation Entertainment. Antitrust enforcers have also opened investigations into the roles Microsoft, Nvidia and OpenAI have played in the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nThe Biden administration has won some big cases, including blocking mergers of some of the world's biggest publishers as well as JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines. It's also had some notable setbacks, including in the sugar and healthcare industries.\n\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.", "source": {"uri":

Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nGoogle almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may land in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nAs expected, Mehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\n\"Advertisers consistently testified that shifting significant ad spending from Google to Bing would be ineffective (and unwise) because of Bing's lack of scale,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\n\"The court confirmed what almost everyone in the industry already knew: that Google is a monopoly and is abusing its power to harm consumers and enrich itself,\" said Roger Alford, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out billions annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said eMarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google. Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives.\"\n\nRegardless she added, a drawn-out appeals process will delay any immediate effects for both consumers and advertisers.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.\n\nKids, screen time and

For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nJudge Mehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sort of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out more than 20 billion dollars (\u00a315 billion) annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices.\n\nAfter the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\nIf there is a significant shake-up, it could be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than 3 trillion dollars (\u00a32.3 trillion). At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about 2 trillion dollars (\u00a31.5 trillion).\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could damage Google at a critical point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that could be affected by Judge Mehta's decision.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured in more than 100 billion dollars in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Mr Nadella said at one point in his evidence. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nHe also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation does not get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with AI, I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" he told the court.\n\nGoogle still faces other legal threats in the US and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.", "source": {"uri": "shropshirestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shropshire Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet of things"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.shropshirestar.com/resizer/v2/F4VDPL4PPVD3LKX75KLO3D5JBE.jpg?auth=1e3e563ac8162ae220277a2803f1a6c48f46ae3f7c86abd6a2874568f7935906&width=1200&height=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

The ruling could potentially change how Google Search operates, depending on what penalties Google is assessed.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly. It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act,\" federal judge Amit Mehta wrote in the 277-page opinion.\n\nThe Sherman Act is an antitrust law that's been on the books since 1890, outlawing monopolistic business practices. The National archives describe the Act thusly, \"The act was designed to restore competition, but it was loosely worded and failed to define such critical terms as \"trust,\" \"combination,\" \"conspiracy,\" and \"monopoly.\"\n\nSpecifically, Google is charged with violating the Sherman Act in two areas; general search services and general text advertising via exclusive distribution agreements. The company has spent billions of dollars on exclusive contracts, including competitors like Apple, to become the dominant search browser on phones and browsers.\n\nSuch contracts helped give Google global scale and most likely helped block other search engines like Microsoft's Bing or the privacy engine DuckDuckGo from gaining better standing.\n\nThis trial has been working through the system since 2020 when the Justice Department and several states sued Google over the company's dominance in search. At the time, the DOJ claimed that Google had over 90% of search traffic. Sites like Similarweb confirm that number showing that competitors like Bing and Yahoo barely have 6% in comparison.\n\nThe actual trial lasted 10 weeks in the fall of 2023, though closing remarks did not come until May of this year, during which Judge Mehta grilled Google lawyers. Google's central argument was that it isn't a monopoly because people use other companies like Amazon to search for products or social media to find music.\n\n\"Certainly I don't think the average person would say, 'Google and Amazon are the same thing,'\" Mehta said.\n\nGoogle's antitrust lawsuit draws comparisons to the turn of the millenium case that was brought against Microsoft for its own anticompetitive practices in forcing Internet Explorer to be on every device.\n\n\"Still, the court is taken aback by the lengths to which Google goes to avoid creating a paper trail for regulators and litigants,\" Mehta wrote in the ruling. \"It is no wonder then that this case has lacked the kind of nakedly anticompetitive communications seen in Microsoft and other Section 2 cases.\"\n\nThe fallout of this ruling will take some time to make its way to consumers. Google will more than likely appeal, but it could drastically alter how Google makes its search engine available to consumers and may change how other companies interact with Google and whether or not Google is the default by impacting how Google deals with them.\n\nIt was likely never going to be the case, but US antitrust officials hinted that a possible Google breakup was in the cards at the beginning of the case, claiming that the tech giant's behavior could stifle innovation or the rise of a successor.", "source": {"uri": "tomsguide.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tom's Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_younker@tomsguide.com", "name": "Scott Younker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sherman Antitrust Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarweb", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Similarweb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDuckGo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DuckDuckGo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet Explorer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cqk4XogUpgb999UzgDRnyK-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

A bipartisan group of state attorneys general participated in the litigation as well. The case revolved around a series of agreements that Google has inked with fellow tech firms to promote its search engine.\n\nIn 2021, Google spent $26.3 billion to remain the default search engine provider across several popular browsers and mobile devices. The products on the list included, among others, Apple Inc.'s iPhones and Safari browser. The Justice Department alleged that Google's practice of inking such agreements amounts to monopolistic behavior, an argument that the court accepted in today's ruling.\n\nThe lawsuit charged that the company's default search engine deal with Apple requires Google to \"be the default - and de facto exclusive - general search engine\" on Safari. In other cases, the Alphabet Inc. unit allegedly prohibited partners from installing rival search engines on their platforms.\n\nThe Justice Department filed the lawsuit in 2020. Discovery, the process whereby the plaintiffs collect evidence such as internal business documents from the defendant, concluded last March. A more than two-month trial followed later in 2023 that included the testimonies of executives from Apple, Microsoft Corp. and other market players.\n\nIn today's decision, Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google illegally maintained a monopoly across two markets: the search engine and general search text advertising segments. Text advertising refers to the ads that Google embeds in search results.\n\nMehta's conclusion about the search engine segment, the first market covered in the case, took several factors into account. One was the competitive importance of default search engine agreements of the kind that Google inked with Apple. To illustrate the impact of such agreements, Mehta pointed out that Bing has a 80% market share on Microsoft's Edge browser, in which it's set as the default search engine.\n\nMehta added that \"if there is genuine competition in the market for general search, it has not manifested in familiar ways, such as fluid market shares, lost business, or new entrants.\" At the same time, the ruling highlighted that Google's feature set is also a factor in its market dominance, with the ruling stating that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nThe second segment in which Google was found to have an illegal monopoly is the search text advertising market. The ruling focused on the prices that the company charges for ads. Mehta wrote that Google's default search engine agreements allowed it to raise ad prices \"without any meaningful competitive constraint.\"\n\nThe manner in which Google will have to remedy the situation is set to be decided in a separate trial down the road. According to Bloomberg, the Justice Department may ask the court to break up the company by separating its core search business. Google, for its part, stated that it plans to appeal today's ruling.\n\n\"As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use,\" said Kent Walker, Google's president of global affairs.", "source": {"uri": "siliconangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SiliconANGLE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the District of Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Edge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Edge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2024/08/Google.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

The company has spent tens of billions of dollars on exclusive contracts to secure a dominant position as the world's default search provider on smartphones and web browsers.\n\nThose contracts have given it the scale to block out would-be rivals such as Microsoft's Bing and DuckDuckGo, the US government alleged in a historic antitrust lawsuit filed during the Trump administration.\n\nNow, said Mehta, that powerful position has led to anticompetitive behavior that must be stopped.\n\nSpecifically, Google's exclusive deals with Apple and other key players in the mobile ecosystem were anticompetitive, Mehta said. Google has also charged high prices in search advertising that reflect its monopoly power in search, he added.\n\nThose contracts have long meant that when users want to find information, Google is generally the easiest and quickest platform to go to, which in turn has fueled Google's massive online advertising business.\n\nWhile the court did not find that Google has a monopoly in search ads, the broader strokes of the opinion represent the first major decision in a string of US-government led competition lawsuits targeting Big Tech. This case in particular has been described as the biggest tech antitrust case since the US government's antitrust showdown with Microsoft at the turn of the millennium.\n\nNeither Google nor the Department of Justice immediately responded to a request for comment. This case is distinct from a separate antitrust suit brought by the Biden administration against Google in 2023 related to the company's advertising technology business. That case is expected to head to trial in early September.\n\nBut Monday's decision marks the second high-profile antitrust defeat for Google after a federal jury in California said in December that Google runs an illegal monopoly with its proprietary app store. The court in that case is still deliberating possible remedies.\n\nMehta's decision is expected to trigger a separate proceeding to determine what penalties Google will face -- and the company is also likely to file an appeal. But the ruling could ultimately upend how Google makes its search engine available to users, by impacting its ability to make the pricey deals with device makers and online service providers that were at the heart of the case.\n\nIf the court takes away Google's agreements that make it the default search engine on so many devices it could hurt the company's core product at an extremely pivotal moment, Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf said in an emailed statement.\n\n\"Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives,\" Mitchell-Wolf said, referring to the growing threat to Google's search dominance posed by artificial intelligence search tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nAt the time the lawsuit was first filed, US antitrust officials also did not rule out the possibility of a Google breakup, warning that Google's behavior could threaten future innovation or the rise of a Google successor.\n\nThe ruling could also be a bellwether for other, major tech antitrust cases that are moving through the courts, including against Apple and Amazon. Both Amazon and Apple have called the antitrust lawsuits filed against them \"wrong on the facts and the law.\"\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN. All Rights Reserved.

The fines or other remedies will be decided in a future hearing.\n\nThe government has asked for \"structural relief\" - which could, in theory at least, mean the break-up of the company.\n\nIn his decision, US District Judge Amit Mehta said Google had paid billions to ensure it is the default search engine on smartphones and browsers.\n\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Judge Mehta wrote in his 277-page opinion.\n\nAlphabet said it plans to appeal against the ruling.\n\n\"This decision recognises that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" the statement from the company said.\n\nUS Attorney General Merrick Garland, the country's top prosecutor, hailed the ruling as a \"historic win for the American people\".\n\n\"No company - no matter how large or influential - is above the law,\" Mr Garland said in a statement on Monday. \"The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nFederal antitrust regulators have filed other pending lawsuits against Big Tech companies - including Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook, Amazon.com and Apple Inc - accusing them of operating unlawful monopolies.\n\nMonday's ruling comes after a 10-week trial in Washington DC, in which prosecutors accused Google of spending billions of dollars annually to Apple, Samsung, Mozilla and others to be pre-installed as the default search engine across platforms.\n\nThe US said Google typically pays more than $10bn (\u00a37.8bn) a year for that privilege, securing its access to a steady stream of user data that helped maintain its hold on the market.\n\nDoing so, prosecutors said, meant other companies have not had the opportunity or resources to meaningfully compete.\n\n\"The best testimony for that, for the importance of defaults, is Google's cheque book,\" argued Department of Justice lawyer Kenneth Dintzer during the trial.\n\nGoogle's search engine is a big revenue generator for the company, bringing in billions of dollars thanks in large part to advertising displayed on its results pages.\n\nGoogle's lawyers defended the company by saying that users are attracted to their search engine because they find it useful, and that Google is investing to make it better for consumers.\n\n\"Google is winning because it's better,\" said Google's lawyer John Schmidtlein during closing arguments earlier this year.\n\nMr Schmidtlein also argued during the trial that Google still faces intense competition, not just from general search engine firms, such as Microsoft's Bing, but more specialised sites and apps that people use to find restaurants, airline flights and more.\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Mehta concluded that being the default search engine is \"extremely valuable real estate\" for Google.\n\n\"Even if a new entrant were positioned from a quality standpoint to bid for the default when an agreement expires, such a firm could compete only if it were prepared to pay partners upwards of billions of dollars in revenue share,\" Judge Mehta wrote.\n\nAnother case against the technology company over its advertising technology is scheduled to go to trial in September.

Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Google abused its monopoly power by paying companies to present its search engine as the default choice on devices and web browsers.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Judge Amit Mehta wrote in Monday's opinion. \"It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.\"\n\nCurrently, Google pays companies such as Apple and Mozilla billions of dollars for prime placement in web browsers and smartphones.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Google paid Apple around $18 billion to be the default search engine on iPhones in 2021, while Google also shares 36% of search ad revenue from Safari with Apple.\n\nMonday's high stakes decision marks the second high-profile antitrust defeat for Google. A federal jury in California previously decided in December that Google runs an illegal monopoly with its proprietary app store. The court in that case is still deliberating possible remedies.\n\nThe judge's decision is now expected to prompt a separate proceeding in order to determine what penalties Google will face, and the company will most likely file an appeal. The latest ruling could also ultimately decide what changes Google makes to its search engine.\n\nIf Google's agreements are taken away by the court, it could have a negative effect on the company's Artificial Intelligence (AI) search tools, Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf said in an emailed statement.\n\n\"Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives,\" Mitchell-Wolf said.\n\nJudge Mehta has yet to rule on remedies for Google's behavior. However, he could force the company to change the way it runs its search business, or order it to sell off parts of that business.\n\nAdditionally, the ruling could set a trend for other tech antitrust cases that are moving through the courts, which include recently reported lawsuits involving Apple and Amazon.\n\nStay informed!

File image\n\nUS District Judge Amit Mehta on Monday (August 5) ruled that Google's search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominant position to stifle competition and hinder innovation.\n\nJudge Mehta's ruling comes after a nearly year-long trial, initiated by the U.S. Justice Department, marking the biggest antitrust case in the US in 25 years. The landmark decisionis likely to have significant implications for the internet giant.\n\nHere's a look at the decision, and how Google maintained its monopoly.\n\n'Google is a monopolist'\n\nThe trial featured testimonies from top executives at Google, Microsoft, and Apple, with the judge reviewing extensive evidence over a 10-week period.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Judge Mehta wrote in his 277-page decision.\n\nThe judge pointed to Google's overwhelming market share, which stands at 89.2 per cent for general search services and rises to 94.9 per cent on mobile devices, as clear evidence of its monopoly.\n\nHow Google maintained monopoly\n\nGoogle's strategy included spending billions annually to ensure its search engine remains the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets.\n\nIn 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion on these default agreements, a practice that Mehta concluded reinforced its monopoly. The judge noted that Microsoft's Bing holds an 80 per cent market share on the Microsoft Edge browser. That, he said, illustrated that other search engines can succeed if not overshadowed by Google's default status.\n\nThe ruling is a significant setback for Google and its parent company, Alphabet Inc., which has defended its search engine's popularity as a result of consumer preference.\n\nPotential impacts\n\nMoving forward, the court will determine the necessary changes or penalties to address Google's anticompetitive practices and restore a more competitive market. A hearing scheduled for September 6 will set the stage for these discussions.\n\nPossible outcomes range from dismantling parts of Google's internet empire to restricting its ability to secure default search agreements on devices.\n\nKent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, announced that the company plans to appeal the decision, arguing that it unfairly penalises Google for its success. \"This decision recognises that Google offers the best search engine but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Walker said.\n\nThe appeals process, which could extend for up to five years, will delay any immediate changes, according to Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf.\n\nThe decision opens the door for class-action lawsuits against Google, citing monopolistic pricing practices. It may benefit competitors like Microsoft, whose own dominance was curtailed by a similar antitrust case in the 1990s. Restrictions on Google's default search deals could also affect Apple, which has significantly benefited from Google's payments, estimated at $20 billion in 2022 alone.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Edge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Edge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Class action"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2023/10/What-does-Googles-antitrust-case-means-for-your-internet-search-habits-.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 201, "textEnd": 209}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-06", "textStart": 2193, "textEnd": 2204}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

It also could affect subsequent cases being waged right now against Facebook, Amazon, and Apple.\n\nMore from David Dayen | Luke Goldstein\n\nIn particular, Judge Mehta found that Google's practice of paying for access to be the default search engine drove its dominance, which amounted to taking close to 90 percent of all search queries in 2020, and nearly 95 percent of all search queries on mobile devices. Google becoming the default browser raised the costs of competition from other search engines to impractical levels.\n\nMehta was not swayed by the argument that \"competition is just a click away\" and that users could easily change default settings to use another browser. \"Roughly 50 percent of all general search queries in the United States flow through a search access point covered by one of the challenged contracts,\" he wrote, referring to special deals whereby Google paid browser or device companies to become the default option. \"Another 20 percent of all general search queries in the United States flow through user-downloaded Chrome, which defaults to Google.\"\n\nIt is an unequivocal ruling for Google's dominance over the search engine function, but there are caveats. Mehta was not swayed by a small part of the plaintiff's argument, mainly laid out by the state AGs, that Google had leveraged its monopoly over the search function to control the back-end digital advertising supply line and distort the market. Mehta ruled narrowly that since Google holds market power over search, it can charge \"supracompetitive\" rates for the text ad placements that appear on its search pages. But the states were more ambitious, claiming that Google controlled adtech markets through SA360 and used that anti-competitively to effectively cut Microsoft's Bing out from its closed system.\n\nThat could prove to be a difficult hurdle to overcome in the DOJ's separate antitrust case filed in 2023 against Google, targeting its monopolization of adtech. Mehta held that the DOJ did not clearly define the relevant market for search advertising and thus Google could not be held liable for abusing a monopoly over it. The DOJ will likely have to better define the market in the adtech case, set to begin this fall in front of a different judge in the Eastern District of Virginia.\n\nThe Google search case will now move to a remedies phase. Judge Mehta will have to determine what penalty should be imposed for Google's exclusive dealing to get its search engine included as the default on browsers and devices. He could unwind the deals, which cost Google $26 billion in 2021. He could require browsers and devices to provide options to users for which search engine to use. Or he could break up Google in some manner.\n\nGoogle will almost certainly appeal the case.", "source": {"uri": "prospect.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The American Prospect"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_dayen@prospect.org", "name": "David Dayen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "luke_goldstein@prospect.org", "name": "Luke Goldstein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sherman Antitrust Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the District of Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice_Antitrust_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web 2.0"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Eastern_District_of_Virginia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google Chrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://prospect.org/downloads/21580/download/Dayen%20on%20Tap%20080524.jpg?cb=253b75c70589ebffc3e508c5f53588f5&w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

ruling, which found that the search giant violated the Sherman Act, a major antitrust law.\n\nThe Department of Justice and a collection of US states brought the case against Google in 2020 over its practice of paying companies like Apple and Samsung billions of dollars a year to have the search engine automatically handle search inquiries on their phones and browsers.\n\nThe company paid Apple alone $18bn to keep Google as the default search engine on iPhones, according to The New York Times.\n\nGoogle's ubiquity, handling some 90 percent of world internet searches, then allowed the company to to dominate the market for sponsored advertising in search results, further entrenching its advantage, according to the ruling.\n\nThe suit also took issue with Google's practice of making phone manufacturers supporting the Android operating system default to certain Google apps to get access to the company's Play Store.\n\nIt's the largest DOJ-led antitrust case against the tech industry since the famous Microsoft case two decades ago, according to The Verge.\n\nAt trial, Google argued it was so successful not via monopoly tactics but because of its attractive product offerings, and should be compared not just with fellow search engines, but other companies like Amazon that rely on web traffic.\n\nThe Independent has contacted Google for comment.\n\nThe decision was only a finding about Google's liability in the case, and a separate proceeding will determine what the search giant needs to do to get back in compliance with the law.\n\nThe ruling is the latest blow to Google, after a federal jury in California found that the company's app marketplace is an illegal monopoly.\n\nThe company faces a sepate case from the DOJ and a group of eight states, accusing it of

Google is violating section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act by running a monopoly business model.\n\nThe court highlighted the results of Judge Mehtata review in a 286-page opinion - SEE HERE. A key excerpt is provided below:\n\nCOURT RULING pdf - [...] \"Google has not achieved market dominance by happenstance. It has hired thousands of highly skilled engineers, innovated consistently, and made shrewd business decisions. The result is the industry's highest quality search engine, which has earned Google the trust of hundreds of millions of daily users.\n\nBut Google also has a major, largely unseen advantage over its rivals: default distribution. Most users access a general search engine through a browser (like Apple's Safari) or a search widget that comes preloaded on a mobile device. Those search access points are preset with a \"default\" search engine. The default is extremely valuable real estate.\n\nBecause many users simply stick to searching with the default, Google receives billions of queries every day through those access points. Google derives extraordinary volumes of user data from such searches. It then uses that information to improve search quality. Google so values such data that, absent a user-initiated change, it stores 18 months-worth of a user's search history and activity.\n\nThe distribution agreements benefit Google in another important way. More users mean more advertisers, and more advertisers mean more revenues. As queries on Google have grown, so too has the amount it earns in advertising dollars. In 2014, Google booked nearly $47 billion in advertising revenue. By 2021, that number had increased more than three-fold to over $146 billion. Bing, by comparison, generated only a fraction of that amount -- less than $12 billion in 2022.\n\nFor years, Google has secured default placements through distribution contracts. It has entered into such agreements with browser developers, mobile device manufacturers, and wireless carriers. These partners agree to install Google as the search engine that is delivered to the user right out of the box at key search access points.\n\nGoogle pays huge sums to secure these preloaded defaults. Usually, the amount is calculated as a percentage of the advertising revenue that Google generates from queries run through the default search access points. This is known as \"revenue share.\" In 2021, those payments totaled more than $26 billion. That is nearly four times more than all of Google's other search-specific costs combined.\n\nIn exchange for revenue share, Google not only receives default placement at the key search access points, but its partners also agree not to preload any other general search engine on the device. Thus, most devices in the United States come preloaded exclusively with Google. These distribution deals have forced Google's rivals to find other ways to reach users.\n\nGoogle's dominance eventually attracted the attention of antitrust enforcers -- the U.S. Department of Justice and nearly every state's Attorney General. They homed in on Google's distribution agreements and in late 2020 filed two separate lawsuits alleging that the agreements and certain other conduct violate Section 2 of the Sherman Act. According to their complaints, Google has unlawfully used the distribution agreements to thwart competition and maintain its monopoly in the market for general search services and in various online advertising markets.\n\nThe proceedings that followed have been remarkable. Discovery began in December 2020 and concluded in March 2023.\n\n[...] After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly. It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.\n\nSpecifically, the court holds that (1) there are relevant product markets for general search services and general search text ads; (2) Google has monopoly power in those markets; (3) Google's distribution agreements are exclusive and have anticompetitive effects; and (4) Google has not offered valid procompetitive justifications for those agreements. Importantly, the court also finds that Google has exercised its monopoly power by charging supracompetitive prices for general search text ads. That conduct has allowed Google to earn monopoly profits.\" (read more)\n\nThis is only one facet to the Google monopoly enterprise. There are other lawsuits challenging the Advertising rules and regulations enforced by Google that block funds from online content providers. Google is a leftist control operation, with comprehensive totalitarian alignment.\n\nDon't think that our U.S. Government is against this monopoly just because they were forced to respond to it with a lawsuit. DHS and the IC love having a single control point they can exploit and compromise. Monopolies are useful for the interests of the government who corrupts and utilizes them.\n\nWithin the Public/Private Technocracy system that Barack Obama helped to build between Big Tech and Government, they both collaborate on the benefits of singular power structures. A pox on all of them!\n\nMSM - Kent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said the company intends to appeal Mehta's findings.\n\n\"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Walker said.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year.

Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nGoogle almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may land in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nAs expected, Mehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\n\"Advertisers consistently testified that shifting significant ad spending from Google to Bing would be ineffective (and unwise) because of Bing's lack of scale,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\n\"The court confirmed what almost everyone in the industry already knew: that Google is a monopoly and is abusing its power to harm consumers and enrich itself,\" said Roger Alford, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out billions annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said eMarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google. Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives.\"\n\nRegardless she added, a drawn-out appeals process will delay any immediate effects for both consumers and advertisers.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.\n\n0 Comments",

Mehta ruled that tech behemoth Google acted unlawfully to preserve its monopoly in the online search market. The ruling could potentially reshape Google's business practices and even alter the framework of the internet, if upheld. Mehta stated that Google exploited its monopoly power by paying companies like Apple to make its search engine the default option on their devices and web browsers.\n\nMehta concluded that Google is a 'monopolist' and has acted as such to maintain its monopoly, thereby violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act. This law prohibits any person or business from monopolizing any part of trade or commerce. In 2021, Google spent $26 billion to remain the default search engine across Apple and Android platforms, with approximately $18 billion going to Apple. The government argued this practice effectively barred competitors from developing their own search engines competitively.\n\nGoogle's president of Global Affairs, Kent Walker, announced the company's intention to appeal the decision. Walker defended Google's actions, asserting that they leveraged their dominant position to create the most effective and useful search engine for consumers and advertisers. The outcome of this case could set a precedent for other antitrust lawsuits currently navigating through the courts.\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) and attorneys general from 38 states and territories filed similar but separate antitrust suits against Google in 2020. They alleged that Google unfairly blocked potential search rivals like Microsoft's Bing and DuckDuckGo. The DOJ estimated that Google dominated a 90% share of the search market, a figure disputed by Google. This case's outcome could influence other antitrust lawsuits, including those against Apple, Meta, and Amazon.\n\nThe ruling could also affect the DOJ's second antitrust suit against Google, which alleges that Google illegally monopolized the digital ads market. Remedies for Google's behavior, yet to be decided by the judge, could include forcing the company to modify how it operates its search business or ordering it to divest parts of that business. Following the ruling, shares of Alphabet, Google's parent company, dropped 4.5%.\n\nGoogle's landmark antitrust defeat has opened a potential window for Bing, Microsoft's long-standing search engine competitor. As per The Information, several senior executives at Microsoft are discussing strategies to capitalize on this unexpected opportunity. They are also exploring the possibility of Bing replacing Google as the default search engine on Apple products. The ultimate impact of Google's antitrust loss on Bing and other rivals remains to be seen as the ruling itself may take years to translate into concrete changes.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sherman Antitrust Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDuckGo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DuckDuckGo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l50820240806094540.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Kent Walker, president of global affairs at Google said that the company acknowledges the court's recognition of its superior search engine but disagrees with the ruling that it abused its position.\n\nWhat Google termed as the 'Big Irony' is: While the decision recognised that Google offers the best search engine but it doesn't want it to be easily available, said Walker, adding the court finds that Google is \"the industry's highest quality search engine\".\n\nHere's Google's statement in full:\n\n\"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available. We appreciate the Court's finding that Google is 'the industry's highest quality search engine, which has earned Google the trust of hundreds of millions of daily users,' that Google 'has long been the best search engine, particularly on mobile devices,' 'has continued to innovate in search' and that 'Apple and Mozilla occasionally assess Google's search quality relative to its rivals and find Google's to be superior.' Given this, and that people are increasingly looking for information in more and more ways, we plan to appeal. As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use.\"\n\nWhat the US judge said in his ruling\n\nThe 10-week trial also saw Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Apple executive Eddy Cue take to the witness box. After their testimonies, Judge Mehta said that Google built and defended its illegal search monopoly. In the ruling, seen as a major win for the US Department of Justice (DoJ), Judge Amit Mehta said that \"Google is a monopolist.\"\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reached the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly. It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.\"\n\n\"Sure, users can access Google's rivals by switching the default search access point or by downloading a rival search app or browser. But the market reality is that users rarely do so.\"\n\n\"The default is extremely valuable real estate. Because many users simply stick to searching with the default, Google receives billions of queries every day through those access points.\"\n\n\"Google, of course, recognizes that losing defaults would dramatically impact its bottom line. For instance, Google has projected that losing the Safari default would result in a significant drop in queries and billions of dollars in lost revenues.\"\n\n\"The distribution agreements have caused a third key anticompetitive effect: They have reduced the incentive to invest and innovate in search.\"\n\n\"There is no genuine 'competition for the contract.' Google has no true competitor.\"\n\n\"Google has not achieved market dominance by happenstance. It has hired thousands of highly skilled engineers, innovated consistently, and made shrewd business decisions. The result is the industry's highest quality search engine, which has earned Google the trust of hundreds of millions of daily users.\"\n\nThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

The New York Times reported that Google paid Apple about $18 billion for being the default in 2021.\n\nDuring the trial, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified that he was concerned about Google's dominance and how it had created a \"Google web\" and that its relationship with Apple was \"oligopolistic.\" He said that if Google continued undeterred, it was likely to become dominant in the race to develop artificial intelligence.\n\nIn his testimony, CEO Sundar Pichai said that Google created a better service for consumers. The company argued in the ruling that users choose to search on Google because they find it useful. John Schmidtlein, Google's lead courtroom lawyer, said, \"Google is winning because it's better.\"\n\nBut the US government argued that Google had a monopoly over general online search services and its agreements to be the automatic search engine on devices and web browsers hurt competition.

Google controls about 90% of the online search market and 95% on smartphones.\n\nThe \"remedy\" phase could be lengthy, followed by potential appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court. The legal wrangling could play out into next year, or even 2026.\n\nShares of Alphabet fell 4.5% on Monday amid a broad decline in tech shares as the wider stock market cratered on recession fears. Google advertising was 77% of Alphabet's total sales in 2023.\n\nAlphabet said it plans to appeal Mehta's ruling. \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Google said in a statement.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland called the ruling \"a historic win for the American people,\" adding that \"no company - no matter how large or influential - is above the law.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the \"pro-competition ruling is a victory for the American people,\" adding that \"Americans deserve an internet that is free, fair, and open for competition.\"\n\nMehta noted that Google had paid $26.3 billion in 2021 alone to ensure that its search engine is the default on smartphones and browsers, and to keep its dominant market share.\n\n\"The default is extremely valuable real estate,\" Mehta wrote. \"Even if a new entrant were positioned from a quality standpoint to bid for the default when an agreement expires, such a firm could compete only if it were prepared to pay partners upwards of billions of dollars in revenue share and make them whole for any revenue shortfalls resulting from the change.\"\n\nHe added, \"Google, of course, recognizes that losing defaults would dramatically impact its bottom line. For instance, Google has projected that losing the Safari default would result in a significant drop in queries and billions of dollars in lost revenues.\"\n\nThe ruling is the first major decision in a series of cases taking on alleged monopolies in Big Tech. This case, filed by the Trump administration, went before a judge from September to November of last year.\n\n\"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, who said a drawn-out legal process would delay any immediate effects for consumers.\n\nIn the past four years, federal antitrust regulators have also sued Meta Platforms, Amazon.com and Apple, claiming the companies have illegally maintained monopolies.\n\nThose cases all began under the administration of former President Donald Trump.\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, said the fact that the case spanned administrations shows strong bipartisan support for antitrust enforcement.\n\n\"It's a huge victory for the American people that antitrust enforcement is alive and well when it comes to competition,\" she said. \"Google is a rampant monopolist.\"\n\nWhen it was filed in 2020, the Google search case was the first time in a generation that the U.S. government accused a major corporation of an illegal monopoly.

For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out more than 20 billion dollars (\u00a315 billion) annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices.\n\nAfter the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\nIf there is a significant shake-up, it could be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than 3 trillion dollars (\u00a32.3 trillion). At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about 2 trillion dollars (\u00a31.5 trillion).\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could damage Google at a critical point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that could be affected by Judge Mehta's decision.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured in more than 100 billion dollars in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Mr Nadella said at one point in his evidence. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nHe also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation does not get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with AI, I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" he told the court.\n\nGoogle still faces other legal threats in the US and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "press_association@jerseyeveningpost.com", "name": "Press Association", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://d3gvyx4eg3tne0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Img38730064.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Google controls about 90% of the online search market and 95% on smartphones.\n\nThe \"remedy\" phase could be lengthy, followed by potential appeals to the US Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit and the US Supreme Court. The legal wrangling could play out into next year, or even 2026.\n\nShares of Alphabet fell 4.5% on Monday amid a broad decline in tech shares as the wider stock market cratered on recession fears. Google advertising was 77% of Alphabet's total sales in 2023.\n\nAlphabet said it plans to appeal Mehta's ruling. \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Google said in a statement.\n\nUS Attorney General Merrick Garland called the ruling \"a historic win for the American people,\" adding that \"no company - no matter how large or influential - is above the law.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the \"pro-competition ruling is a victory for the American people,\" adding that \"Americans deserve an internet that is free, fair, and open for competition.\"\n\nBILLIONS PAID\n\nMehta noted that Google had paid $26.3 billion in 2021 alone to ensure that its search engine is the default on smartphones and browsers, and to keep its dominant market share.\n\n\"The default is extremely valuable real estate,\" Mehta wrote. \"Even if a new entrant were positioned from a quality standpoint to bid for the default when an agreement expires, such a firm could compete only if it were prepared to pay partners upwards of billions of dollars in revenue share and make them whole for any revenue shortfalls resulting from the change.\"\n\nHe added, \"Google, of course, recognizes that losing defaults would dramatically impact its bottom line. For instance, Google has projected that losing the Safari default would result in a significant drop in queries and billions of dollars in lost revenues.\"\n\nThe ruling is the first major decision in a series of cases taking on alleged monopolies in Big Tech. This case, filed by the Trump administration, went before a judge from September to November of last year.\n\n\"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, who said a drawn-out legal process would delay any immediate effects for consumers.\n\nIn the past four years, federal antitrust regulators have also sued Meta Platforms, Amazon.com and Apple, claiming the companies have illegally maintained monopolies. Those cases all began under the administration of former President Donald Trump.\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, said the fact that the case spanned administrations shows strong bipartisan support for antitrust enforcement.\n\n\"It's a huge victory for the American people that antitrust enforcement is alive and well when it comes to competition,\" she said. \"Google is a rampant monopolist.\"\n\nWhen it was filed in 2020, the Google search case was the first time in a generation that the US government accused a major corporation of an illegal monopoly.

Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nGoogle almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may land in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nAs expected, Mehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\n\"Advertisers consistently testified that shifting significant ad spending from Google to Bing would be ineffective (and unwise) because of Bing's lack of scale,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\n\"The court confirmed what almost everyone in the industry already knew: that Google is a monopoly and is abusing its power to harm consumers and enrich itself,\" said Roger Alford, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out billions annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said eMarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google. Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives.\"\n\nRegardless she added, a drawn-out appeals process will delay any immediate effects for both consumers and advertisers.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.\n\nKids, screen time and

key antitrust case - Manila Standard", "body": "A US judge on Monday handed Google a major legal blow, ruling in a landmark antitrust case that it has maintained a monopoly with its dominant search engine.\n\nThe court decision against a \"big tech\" giant could alter how the sector operates in future.\n\nDistrict Court Judge Amit Mehta found that Google had a monopoly for search and for text ads through exclusive distribution agreements that made it the \"default\" option that people were likely to use on devices.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote in his ruling.\n\nThe internet behemoth \"has a major, largely unseen advantage over its rivals: default distribution,\" he wrote.\n\nThe antitrust trial pitting US prosecutors and nearly a dozen states against Google ended in May.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said US Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law.\"\n\nGoogle will appeal the verdict, according to global affairs president Kent Walker.\n\nWalker pointed out that Mehta concludes Google is the industry's highest quality search engine, particularly on mobile devices.\n\n\"Given this, and that people are increasingly looking for information in more and more ways, we plan to appeal,\" Walker said.\n\n\"As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use.\"\n\nIt remained to be seen what remedies or damages the judge might order in the case.\n\nIn one possible good sign for Google, Mehta concluded in his ruling that the tech titan's violation of the Sherman Act did not have \"anticompetitive effects.\"\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf.\n\n\"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue,\" she added, referring to Google's parent company.\n\nEven losing the option of making exclusive deals to be the default option on browsers, smartphones or computers would hurt Google, according to the analyst.\n\nGoogle's search business would be hampered as generative artificial intelligence wielded by Microsoft's Bing and OpenAI budding \"SearchGPT\" ramp up competition.\n\n\"The biggest winner from today's ruling isn't consumers or little tech, it's Microsoft,\" said Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich.\n\n\"Microsoft has underinvested in search for decades, but today's ruling opens the door to a court mandate of default deals for Bing.\"\n\nMitchell-Wolf expected a drawn-out appeals process to delay any immediate effects of the verdict on consumers or advertisers.\n\nThe trial was the first time the US Department of Justice has faced a big tech company in court since Microsoft was targeted more than two decades ago over the dominance of its Windows operating system.\n\nMehta presided over several months of testimony late last year that saw Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other top executives take the stand.\n\nAt the heart of the government's case was the massive payments made by Google to Apple and other companies to keep its world-leading search engine as the default on iPhones, web browsers and other products.\n\nCourt testimony revealed that these payments reach the tens of billions of dollars every year to keep its prime real estate on Apple hardware or the Safari and Mozilla browsers.\n\nJustice department lawyers argued that Google achieved and perpetuated its

The court also declines to sanction Google under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(e) for its failure to preserve its employees' chat messages.\"\n\nThe court zoomed in on Google's exclusive search deal with Apple on its iPhone and iPad devices and its Android mobile operating system. \"Antitrust enforcers alleged that Google has illegally maintained a monopoly over online search and related advertising. The government said that Google has paid Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. and others billions over decades for prime placement on smartphones and web browsers.

Most users access a general search engine through a browser (like Apple's Safari) or a search widget that comes preloaded on a mobile device,\" the judge wrote in his decision. \"Those search access points are preset with a \"default\" search engine. The default is extremely valuable real estate. Because many users simply stick to searching with the default, Google receives billions of queries every day through those access points. Google derives extraordinary volumes of user data from such searches. It then uses that information to improve search quality. Google so values such data that, absent a user-initiated change, it stores 18 months-worth of a user's search history and activity,\" he continues to write.\n\nThe rivals? \"In exchange for revenue share, Google not only receives default placement at the key search access points, but its partners also agree not to preload any other general search engine on the device. Thus, most devices in the United States come preloaded exclusively with Google. These distribution deals have forced Google's rivals to find other ways to reach users,\" the judge explained.\n\nSo now what? Well, the courts need to go through the remedy phase. I asked my colleague, Greg Sterling, what he thinks will happen with the remedy and he said on X, \"Breakup or draconian restraints.\"\n\nI suspect so - this will have a serious impact on Google's Search business. Exactly what will change will be unclear but I wouldn't be surprised if Apple is forced to allow other search players easier (less costly) ways to become the default on the iPhone and iPad. I wouldn't be surprised if Google is forced to make it much easier for users to change the default search provider on Android. But this can get even worse for Google.\n\nTime will tell what remedy the federal court will come up with.", "source": {"uri": "seroundtable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Search Engine Roundtable"}, "authors": [{"uri": "barry_schwartz@seroundtable.com", "name": "Barry Schwartz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Search advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PDF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sherman Antitrust Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Rules_of_Civil_Procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Rules of Civil Procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Electronics", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_widget", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software widget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://images.seroundtable.com/broken-apart-google-logo-1722887162.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

This significant defeat for the tech giant could have far-reaching implications for how Americans access information online and potentially disrupt Google's long-standing dominance.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Judge Mehta wrote. \"It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.\"\n\nThe ruling came from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, marking a decisive rebuke of Google's core business. Google has invested billions in exclusive contracts to ensure it remains the default search provider on smartphones and web browsers, effectively sidelining competitors like Microsoft's Bing and DuckDuckGo. This strategy, the court found, was central to Google's anticompetitive behavior.\n\nThe court highlighted Google's exclusive deals with Apple and other key players in the mobile ecosystem as particularly egregious, stating that these agreements were anticompetitive. Additionally, Google's monopoly power allowed it to charge high prices in search advertising, which has been a significant revenue source for the company.\n\n\"This victory against Google is a historic win for the American people,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. \"No company - no matter how large or influential - is above the law.\"\n\nGoogle, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, is likely to face a separate proceeding to determine penalties. Potential remedies could include changes to how Google makes its search engine available, possibly affecting its ability to secure exclusive deals. Experts like Vanderbilt University law professor Rebecca Allensworth suggest that the court could also implement measures such as a \"choice screen\" to inform users about alternative search engines.\n\nDespite the significant ruling, Google's broader search ad monopoly was not confirmed, reflecting the complexities of the case. This decision is distinct from another antitrust suit brought against Google by the Biden administration in 2023 concerning its advertising technology business, which is set for trial in early September.\n\nThis ruling represents the second major antitrust defeat for Google within a year. Previously, a federal jury in California found that Google ran an illegal monopoly through its app store. That case is still pending a decision on possible remedies.\n\n\"This is definitely a landmark,\" said Diana Moss, vice president and director of competition policy at the Progressive Policy Institute. She likened the ruling to historic antitrust cases, including the breakup of AT&T's telephone monopoly and Standard Oil, and Microsoft's illegal bundling of its Internet Explorer web browser with Windows.\n\nHowever, not everyone is applauding the decision. Adam Kovacevich, founder of the tech advocacy group Chamber of Progress and a former Google policy director, argued that the biggest beneficiary of the ruling would be Microsoft, not consumers. \"Microsoft has underinvested in search for decades, but today's ruling opens the door to a court mandate of default deals for Bing. That's a slap in the face to consumers who chose Google because they think it's the best,\" he said.\n\nThe ruling also raises broader implications for the tech industry. It could signal the start of a new era of antitrust enforcement that might challenge other major tech companies like Apple and Amazon, both of which are facing their own antitrust lawsuits. The decision could also bolster the Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit against Live Nation, the parent company of Ticketmaster.\n\nJudge Mehta's 277-page opinion follows a detailed trial that included testimony from high-ranking executives from Google and its rivals. Much of the trial was conducted behind closed doors due to the sensitive nature of the business information discussed.\n\nCritics argue that Google's monopoly on search allows it to maintain a significant advantage in artificial intelligence. By controlling a vast amount of search data, Google can train its AI models more effectively than its competitors, potentially cementing its dominance in the emerging AI landscape.\n\n\"If the court takes away Google's agreements that make it the default search engine on so many devices, it could hurt the company's core product at an extremely pivotal moment,\" said Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, senior analyst at Emarketer. She highlighted the growing threat posed by AI-powered search tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT.", "source": {"uri": "btimesonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Times"}, "authors": [],

and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote in his ruling.\n\nThe internet behemoth \"has a major, largely unseen advantage over its rivals: default distribution,\" he wrote.\n\nThe anti-trust trial pitting US prosecutors and nearly a dozen states against Google ended in May.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said US Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law.\"\n\nGoogle will appeal the verdict, according to global affairs president Kent Walker.\n\nWalker pointed out that Mehta concludes Google is the industry's highest quality search engine, particularly on mobile devices.\n\n\"Given this, and that people are increasingly looking for information in more and more ways, we plan to appeal,\" Walker said.\n\n\"As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use.\"\n\nIt remained to be seen what remedies or damages the judge might order in the case.\n\nIn one possible good sign for Google, Mehta concluded in his ruling that the tech titan's violation of the Sherman Act did not have \"anticompetitive effects.\"\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf.\n\n\"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue,\" she added, referring to Google's parent company.\n\nEven losing the option of making exclusive deals to be the default option on browsers, smartphones or computers would hurt Google, according to the analyst.\n\nGoogle's search business would be hampered as generative artificial intelligence wielded by Microsoft's Bing and OpenAI budding \"SearchGPT\" ramp up competition.\n\n\"The biggest winner from today's ruling isn't consumers or little tech, it's Microsoft,\" said Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich.\n\n\"Microsoft has underinvested in search for decades, but today's ruling opens the door to a court mandate of default deals for Bing.\"\n\nMitchell-Wolf expected a drawn-out appeals process to delay any immediate effects of the verdict on consumers or advertisers.\n\nThe trial was the first time the US Department of Justice has faced a big tech company in court since Microsoft was targeted more than two decades ago over the dominance of its Windows operating system.\n\nMehta presided over several months of testimony late last year that saw Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other top executives take the stand.\n\nAt the heart of the government's case was the massive payments made by Google to Apple and other companies to keep its world-leading search engine as the default on iPhones, web browsers and other products.\n\nCourt testimony revealed that these payments reach the tens of billions of dollars every year to keep its prime real estate on Apple hardware or the Safari and Mozilla browsers.\n\nJustice department lawyers argued that Google achieved and perpetuated its dominance -- and strangled rivals -- through these default deals that also expanded to Samsung and other device makers.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"},

This decision, handed down by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta on Monday, marks a significant victory for federal authorities aiming to curb Big Tech's dominance and could reshape how millions of Americans access information online.\n\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Judge Mehta wrote in his ruling. He emphasized that Google's control over 90% of the online search market and 95% on smartphones is a clear indication of its monopolistic behavior.\n\nThe ruling sets the stage for a second trial to determine potential remedies, which could include breaking up Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc. This would be a seismic shift in the online advertising world, where Google has held sway for years. The legal battle is expected to extend into next year or even 2026, with potential appeals to higher courts.\n\nShares of Alphabet dropped 4.5% on Monday amidst a broader decline in tech stocks, reflecting market jitters about the ruling's implications. Google has announced plans to appeal the decision. \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" the company stated.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland hailed the ruling as a historic win for the American people, asserting that \"no company - no matter how large or influential - is above the law.\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre echoed this sentiment, describing the ruling as a victory for competition and a free, fair, and open internet.\n\nJudge Mehta's decision highlighted Google's extensive spending to secure its position as the default search engine on smartphones and web browsers. In 2021 alone, Google spent $26.3 billion on these exclusive contracts, ensuring that its search engine remained the go-to choice for users. \"The default is extremely valuable real estate,\" Mehta noted, emphasizing that new entrants would struggle to compete without similar financial muscle.\n\nThis ruling is the first major decision in a series of cases challenging alleged monopolies in Big Tech. The lawsuit against Google was initially filed by the Trump administration and proceeded to trial last year. The decision comes at a time when federal antitrust regulators have also taken on other tech giants like Meta, Amazon, and Apple, alleging illegal monopolistic practices.\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, described the ruling as a significant victory for antitrust enforcement. \"Google is a rampant monopolist,\" she said, underscoring the bipartisan support for such regulatory actions.\n\nThe ruling acknowledged the quality of Google's search engine but criticized the company's use of default agreements to stifle competition. Judge Mehta pointed out that other search engines, like Microsoft's Bing, have managed to capture significant market share on platforms where they are the default option, illustrating that competition can thrive under different conditions.\n\nThe next phase of the case will focus on determining the appropriate remedies to restore competitive conditions. These could range from imposing fines to more drastic measures like breaking up Alphabet or banning Google from entering into default search agreements. The latter could have far-reaching implications for Apple, which has benefited significantly from its deals with Google.", "source": {"uri": "btimesonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Klobuchar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amy Klobuchar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://datacdn.btimesonline.com/data/images/full/121172/google.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\nThis landmark decision could significantly impact how tech giants operate in the modern internet era.\n\nIn a detailed 286-page ruling, Judge Mehta highlighted Google's abuse of its monopoly over the search business. He pointed out that Google's distribution agreements effectively blocked competitors from entering the market, impairing their ability to compete.\n\nThe ruling noted that Google paid $26 billion to make its search engine the default option on smartphones and web browsers. This practice has prevented other competitors from gaining a foothold in the market.\n\nThe Justice Department and several states had sued Google, accusing it of cementing its dominance by paying companies like Apple and Samsung billions of dollars annually to automatically handle search queries on their devices.\n\nJudge Mehta emphasized that Google's monopolizing distribution on phones and browsers allowed it to raise online advertising prices without consequences.\n\nHe noted that Google's monopoly power, upheld by \"exclusive distribution agreements,\" has allowed the company to raise text ad prices without facing any \"meaningful competitive\" constraints.\n\nDespite Google's arguments, evidence showed that the company's monopoly in search text ads allowed it to drive up prices significantly.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland hailed the ruling as a \"historic win for the American people,\" emphasizing that no company is above the law.\n\nFederal antitrust regulators have also filed lawsuits against other Big Tech companies, including Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Apple, accusing them of operating unlawful monopolies.\n\nProsecutors highlighted that Google typically pays more than $10 billion annually to secure its position as the default search engine, which has helped it maintain a significant market share.\n\nJudge Mehta noted that Google's market share in general search increased from about 80% in 2009 to 90% by 2020.\n\nBy contrast, Bing holds less than 6% market share. The ruling indicated that Google's payments to companies like Apple, to secure default positions on browsers, have prevented meaningful competition.\n\nThe Justice Department has not yet specified the changes it will seek, but potential remedies could include separating Alphabet's search business, unwinding exclusive deals, or requiring Google to license its search index; the next trial phase will determine these remedies.\n\nJudge Mehta concluded that Google's position as the default search engine is exceptionally \"valuable real estate.\"\n\nThe decision underscores Google's significant payments to maintain this position, raising concerns about the feasibility of displacing Google in the market.\n\nMehta's decision is viewed as measured and balanced, likely to withstand appeals, and serves as a blueprint for future tech monopoly cases.\n\nGoogle plans to appeal the decision, maintaining that its success is due to offering superior products that consumers prefer.\n\nGoogle's lawyers argued that the company faces intense competition from various platforms and that its market share results from creating valuable services for users.\n\nThe next antitrust trial involving the DOJ and Google is scheduled to start on September 9th in Virginia. This trial will examine whether Google has monopolized digital advertising technology.\n\nThis ruling is the first in a series of tech monopoly cases, setting a precedent for future antitrust actions and shaping the regulatory landscape for Google and other Big Tech companies.", "source": {"uri": "fonearena.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FoneArena"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the District of Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Internet_Marketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Internet Marketing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 56}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-09", "textStart": 3372, "textEnd": 3385}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

The company has spent tens of billions of dollars on exclusive contracts to secure a dominant position as the world's default search provider on smartphones and web browsers.\n\nThose contracts have given it the scale to block out would-be rivals such as Microsoft's Bing and DuckDuckGo, the US government alleged in a historic antitrust lawsuit filed during the Trump administration.\n\nNow, said Mehta, that powerful position has led to anticompetitive behavior that must be stopped.\n\nSpecifically, Google's exclusive deals with Apple and other key players in the mobile ecosystem were anticompetitive, Mehta said. Google has also charged high prices in search advertising that reflect its monopoly power in search, he added.\n\nThose contracts have long meant that when users want to find information, Google is generally the easiest and quickest platform to go to, which in turn has fueled Google's massive online advertising business.\n\nWhile the court did not find that Google has a monopoly in search ads, the broader strokes of the opinion represent the first major decision in a string of US-government led competition lawsuits targeting Big Tech. This case in particular has been described as the biggest tech antitrust case since the US government's antitrust showdown with Microsoft at the turn of the millennium.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law.\"\n\nThe White House called the ruling \"a victory for the American people.\"\n\n\"As President Biden and Vice President Harris have long said, Americans deserve an internet that is free, fair, and open for competition,\" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement Monday night.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment. This case is distinct from a separate antitrust suit brought by the Biden administration against Google in 2023 related to the company's advertising technology business. That case is expected to head to trial in early September.\n\nBut Monday's decision marks the second high-profile antitrust defeat for Google after a federal jury in California said in December that Google runs an illegal monopoly with its proprietary app store. The court in that case is still deliberating possible remedies.\n\nMehta's decision is expected to trigger a separate proceeding to determine what penalties Google will face -- after which point the company is also likely to file an appeal, meaning it may take months or even years for any potential consequences to play out. But the ruling could ultimately upend how Google makes its search engine available to users, by impacting its ability to make the pricey deals with device makers and online service providers that were at the heart of the case.\n\nOther remedies could be on the table, too. For example, the court could force Google to implement a \"choice screen\" letting users know about other available search engines, Vanderbilt University law professor Rebecca Allensworth told CNN.\n\nThe company is also likely to face a monetary fine, although fines are \"not the primary way in which the American antitrust system enforces the law,\" because they tend to be a \"drop in the bucket for a huge, very profitable company like Google,\" she said.\n\nAt the time the lawsuit was first filed, US antitrust officials also did not rule out the possibility of a Google breakup, warning that Google's behavior could threaten future innovation or the rise of a Google successor.\n\nMonday's decision against Google will likely be remembered in the same breath as other major antitrust cases throughout history, some antitrust experts said. That list includes the breakup of AT&T's telephone monopoly and Standard Oil, as well as Microsoft's illegal bundling of its Internet Explorer web browser with Windows, said Diana Moss, vice president and director of competition policy at the Progressive Policy Institute.\n\nIn each of those cases, Moss said, the courts highlighted a specific business practice or mechanism -- such as Microsoft's browser bundling -- as a violation of US competition law.\n\nThe Google decision this week is no different, zeroing in on the search giant's exclusive contracts and finding huge problems with the use of such by large, monopolistic firms.\n\n\"This is definitely a landmark,\" said Moss, adding that \"it's very clear in signaling that the use of exclusive contracts in the hands of a monopolist violates the law.\"\n\nHowever, Adam Kovacevich, founder of the tech advocacy group Chamber of Progress and a former Google policy director, pushed back on the ruling, saying, \"the biggest winner from today's ruling isn't consumers or little tech, it's Microsoft.\"\n\n\"Microsoft has underinvested in search for decades, but today's ruling opens the door to a court mandate of default deals for Bing. That's a slap in the face to consumers who chose Google because they think it's the best,\" Kovacevich said. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified as part of the Google antitrust trial.\n\nThe decision won't just affect users of Google's search engine. It will also have ripple effects across the economy as businesses digest the message Mehta is sending about business contracts, Moss said.\n\nThe ruling could also be a bellwether for other major tech antitrust cases, including against Apple and Amazon. Both Amazon and Apple have called the antitrust lawsuits filed against them \"wrong on the facts and the law.\" It could also boost to the Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit against Live Nation, the parent of Ticketmaster, Moss said said, given how central exclusivity deals are to that lawsuit.\n\n\"There are a lot of parts of the government's arguments in its case against Google that are puzzle pieces to their other cases,\" Allensworth said.\n\nMehta's 277-page opinion follows a lengthy, multiweek trial last year that saw high-ranking executives from Google, as well as rivals and partners including Apple, Microsoft and others, testify in person. Much of the complex proceeding took place behind closed doors, reflecting the sensitive business information involved in the deals that powered Google's search dominance.\n\nAt trial, some critics warned that Google's search monopoly, which is fed by a never-ending supply of user search queries, would allow it to leapfrog to a dominant position in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe enormous amount of search data that is provided to Google through its default agreements can help Google train its artificial intelligence models to be better than anyone else's -- threatening to give Google an unassailable advantage in AI that would further entrench its power, Microsoft CEO Nadella said from the witness stand.\n\nNadella's testimony highlighted how the government's case may have far-reaching effects that go beyond traditional search and may shape the future of a technology world leaders have described as potentially transformational.\n\nIf the court takes away Google's agreements that make it the default search engine on so many devices, it could hurt the company's core product at an extremely pivotal moment, Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf said in an emailed statement.\n\n\"Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives,\" Mitchell-Wolf said, referring to the growing threat to Google's search dominance posed by artificial intelligence search tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nCNN's Aileen Graef contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The company has spent tens of billions of dollars on exclusive contracts to secure a dominant position as the world's default search provider on smartphones and web browsers.\n\nThose contracts have given it the scale to block out would-be rivals such as Microsoft's Bing and DuckDuckGo, the US government alleged in a historic antitrust lawsuit filed during the Trump administration.\n\nNow, said Mehta, that powerful position has led to anticompetitive behavior that must be stopped.\n\nSpecifically, Google's exclusive deals with Apple and other key players in the mobile ecosystem were anticompetitive, Mehta said. Google has also charged high prices in search advertising that reflect its monopoly power in search, he added.\n\nThose contracts have long meant that when users want to find information, Google is generally the easiest and quickest platform to go to, which in turn has fueled Google's massive online advertising business.\n\nWhile the court did not find that Google has a monopoly in search ads, the broader strokes of the opinion represent the first major decision in a string of US-government led competition lawsuits targeting Big Tech. This case in particular has been described as the biggest tech antitrust case since the US government's antitrust showdown with Microsoft at the turn of the millennium.\n\nGoogle didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMehta's decision is expected to trigger a separate proceeding to determine what penalties Google will face - and the company is also likely to file an appeal.

'Monopolist' Google: Ruling Says Tech Titan Violated the Law", "body": "If there's one thing that tech conglomerate Google is synonymous with, it's with being a search engine.\n\nIn fact, the term \"Googling\" has entered the modern lexicon, effectively meaning \"to search online about a subject.\"\n\nAfter a recent major court ruling, Google may be trying to distance itself from that sort of verbiage.\n\nAs chronicled by multiple outlets, the government may have finally gotten one on Google after U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta outright called the tech titan a \"monopolist\" -- and it all comes back to how (overly) ubiquitous Google is when it comes to search engines.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, this is the first time \"in more than 20 years\" that the government has actually gotten an antitrust win against a \"tech giant.\"\n\nThis rare and historic win for the government comes after Mehta effectively ruled that Google was sidelining competitors with unfair practices, and that was giving the company carte blanche to provide poorer quality service to users due to the lack of a meaningful alternative.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote in the ruling, which the New York Times chronicled.\n\nMehta's ruling boiled down to four key factors: \"Specifically, the court holds that (1) there are relevant product markets for general search services and general search text ads; (2) Google has monopoly power in those markets; (3) Google's distribution agreements are exclusive and have anticompetitive effects; and (4) Google has not offered valid procompetitive justifications for those agreements.\"\n\n\"Importantly,\" Mehta noted, \"the court also finds that Google has exercised its monopoly power by charging supracompetitive prices for general search text ads.\n\n\"That conduct has allowed Google to earn monopoly profits.\"\n\nAccording to The Verge, another key issue at hand is the manner in which Google secured being the exclusive search engine for both Samsung and Apple -- the two leading makers of smartphones -- and squeezed out other competitors.\n\nAdditionally, the tech outlet noted that Google paid Apple $20 billion in 2022 for that sort of premium app positioning.\n\nMehta did make several rulings in favor of Google, including that the company \"is not liable for its actions involving its advertising platform.\"\n\nStill, those small wins may not mean much given the massive ramifications this ruling could have on a number of things, including ad revenue via the search engine.\n\nThe timing also couldn't be worse for Google.\n\nThe massive tech company is grappling with a pair of seemingly self-inflicted PR wounds.\n\nDays before Mehta's ruling, Google was blasted for a \"soul crushing\" commercial at the already highly polarizing 2024 Summer Olympic Games.\n\nShortly before that incident, Google was publicly ripped -- by much more public figures -- after many accused its search engine of intentionally squelching search results involving former President Donald Trump.\n\nPer The Verge, the next step of this saga will be be yet another antitrust trial between the Department of Justice and Google, scheduled for Sept. 9.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bryan_chai@westernjournal.com", "name": "Bryan Chai", "type": "author",

The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe ruling follows a 10-week trial where prosecutors argued that Google spends over US$10 billion (nearly 355 billion baht) annually to be pre-installed as the default search engine on platforms like Apple and Samsung. This practice ensures a constant stream of user data, cementing Google's market dominance and stifling competition.\n\nDOJ lawyer Kenneth Dintzer pointed out that the best testimony for the importance of defaults is Google's chequebook.\n\nMeanwhile, Google's defence claimed users choose their search engine because it's the best, not because of default settings, reported BBC News.\n\nJudge Mehta concluded that being the default search engine is extremely valuable real estate for Google.\n\n\"Even if a new entrant were positioned from a quality standpoint to bid for the default, such a firm could compete only if it were prepared to pay partners upwards of billions of dollars in revenue share.\"", "source": {"uri": "thethaiger.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Thaiger"}, "authors": [{"uri": "puntid_tantivangphaisal@thethaiger.com", "name": "Puntid Tantivangphaisal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_baht", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thai baht"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://thethaiger.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-06-142451-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 165, "textEnd": 173}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

The search engine giant controls about 90% of the online search market, and 95% on smartphones.\n\nThe \"remedy\" phase could be lengthy, followed by potential appeals to the District of Columbia Circuit and US Supreme Court. The legal wrangling could play out into next year, or even 2026.\n\nShares of Google parent Alphabet fell 4.5% on Monday as part of a broad tech share decline. Google advertising was 77% of Alphabet's total sales in 2023.\n\nAlphabet said it plans to appeal Mehta's ruling. \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Google said in a statement.\n\nUS Attorney General Merrick Garland called the ruling \"a historic win for the American people,\" adding that \"no company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law.\"\n\nMehta noted that Google had paid US$26.3 billion (RM116.4 billion) in 2021 alone to ensure that its search engine is the default on smartphones and browsers, and to keep its dominant market share.\n\n\"The default is extremely valuable real estate ... Even if a new entrant were positioned from a quality standpoint to bid for the default when an agreement expires, such a firm could compete only if it were prepared to pay partners upwards of billions of dollars in revenue share and make them whole for any revenue shortfalls resulting from the change,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nHe added, \"Google, of course, recognises that losing defaults would dramatically impact its bottom line. For instance, Google has projected that losing the Safari default would result in a significant drop in queries and billions of dollars in lost revenues.\"\n\nThe ruling is the first major decision in a series of cases taking on alleged monopolies in Big Tech. This case, filed by the Trump administration, went before a judge from September to November of last year.\n\n\"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, who said a drawn-out legal process would delay any immediate effects for consumers.\n\nIn the past four years, federal antitrust regulators have also sued Meta Platforms, Amazon.com and Apple, claiming the companies have illegally maintained monopolies.\n\nThose cases all began under the administration of former president Donald Trump.\n\nAmy Klobuchar, a Democratic US senator who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, said the fact that the case spanned administrations shows strong bipartisan support for antitrust enforcement.\n\n\"It's a huge victory for the American people that antitrust enforcement is alive and well when it comes to competition,\" she said. \"Google is a rampant monopolist.\"\n\nWhen it was filed in 2020, the Google search case was the first time in a generation that the US government accused a major corporation of an illegal monopoly.

Google, Mehta found that Google has \"violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by maintaining its monopoly in two product markets in the United States -- general services and general text advertising -- through its exclusive distribution agreements.\"\n\nThe American Economic Liberties Project (ALEP) called the ruling a \"tremendous win for consumers, innovation, and the entire tech industry.\"\n\nDuring a 10-week trial last year, the DOJ argued Google had used exclusionary contracts to block its competitors from reaching potential users. The company's deals with web firms such as Mozilla and cell phone companies like Apple and Samsung have made Google the default search engine on millions of people's phones and computers, as has its contracts with other major tech firms and service providers.\n\nThe trial revealed that Google shares 36% of its search ad revenues from Safari with Apple and paid the company $20 billion in 2022 to ensure Google's search engine would have default status for Apple customers.\n\nWhile paying billions of dollars per year to maintain its default status, Google has been using its dominance over ad space to collect more data about users and improve its search engine, while its rivals have been cut off from that ad space.\n\n\"If that's what it takes for somebody to dislodge Google as the default search engine, wouldn't the folks that wrote the Sherman Act be concerned about it?\" asked Mehta.\n\nThe Justice Department proved to the court that Google had ensured its search engine would conduct nearly 90% of all web searches.\n\nVanderbilt University law professor Rebecca Haw Allensworth toldThe New York Times the ruling represents \"a very prominent test of the Biden administration's new antitrust enforcement agenda.\"\n\nThe DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have also sued Apple, Meta, and Amazon for monopolizing the smartphone, social media, and online selling markets.\n\nWilliam Kovacic, former chairman of the FTC, told the Times in June that a victory against Google would create \"momentum that supports [the government's] other cases.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) was among those who applauded the ruling, saying the unfair practices Mehta outlined \"are the exact behaviors that hurt consumers, competition, and small businesses.\"\n\nLee Hepner, senior legal counsel at ALEP, said the ruling \"strikes at the core of how hundreds of millions of Americans experience the internet.\"\n\n\"It illustrates how Google has become one of the most powerful companies in the world while undermining innovation and degrading the quality of its core product,\" said Hepner. \"The remedy must match the court's striking verdict in this case. At a minimum that means an end to Google's exclusive default agreements and breaking up business lines that have allowed Google to extend its monopoly into every corner of the internet.\"\n\nGoogle is expected to appeal Mehta's decision, but as it faces another antitrust case brought by the DOJ over its advertising technology business -- set to go to trial September 9 -- ALEP interim executive director Nidhi Hegde expressed hope that Monday's ruling \"sends a resounding signal that the antimonopoly movement is here to stay.\"\n\n\"The promise of antitrust enforcement is that it will fully restore competition where it has been lost,\" said Hepner, \"and we'll be advocating that the court use all of its power to do so.\"", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news",

The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce the antitrust laws.\"\n\nGoogle said it plans to appeal the decision.\n\n\"As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use,\" Kent Walker, President of Google Global Affairs, said in a statement.\n\nMehta found that Google doesn't have a monopoly in the market for general search advertising, noting that competitors like Amazon.com, Walmart and other retailers have begun to offer advertising related to searches on their own websites.\n\nBut Google does have a monopoly over search text ads, which appear at the top of a search results page to draw users to websites, he said.\n\nMehta's decision focuses solely on Google's liability, nine months after the Justice Department and a group of states held a 10-week trial in federal court. Mehta scheduled a hearing for next month to discuss the timing for a separate trial on the remedy.\n\nThe Justice Department hasn't yet said what changes it will seek, though it presented evidence that efforts by European regulators to require Google to offer users a choice of search engines led few to switch.\n\nThe agency could demand the separation of Alphabet's search business from other products, like Android or Chrome, which -- if ordered by the juge -- would mark the biggest forced breakup of a US company since AT&T was dismantled in 1984.\n\nThe judge could also stop short of ordering a full breakup and chose to unwind the exclusive search deals. Another option could be to require Google to license its search index, which is the data that it uses to build its search results.\n\nAntitrust enforcers separately sued Google for allegedly monopolizing the technology used to buy, sell and serve display advertising online.\n\nIn that case, which is set for trial in Virginia federal court next month, the government is seeking to force Google to sell off some of its advertising technology products.\n\nDan Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, said the decision adds to the \"black cloud\" of legal and regulatory uncertainty that has been hovering over the company.\n\n\"It does create some doubt in a company that already kind of disappointed on the quarter,\" he said.\n\nMehta's decision is \"reasonable and balanced,\" accepting some but not all of the government's arguments, which will likely help in any appeals, said William Kovacic, who teaches antitrust at George Washington Law School.\n\n\"His decision is measured and not simply a credulous acceptance of the government's arguments,\" said Kovacic, who served as chair of the Federal Trade Commission during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nSome of the Mehta's analysis about advertising markets may raise difficulties for the government as it pursues its second case against Google, Kovacic said.\n\nBut the opinion will likely be helpful for a number of the government's other antitrust cases awaiting trial against Apple, Amazon and Meta Platforms on how to consider justifications by the companies for their behavior, he said.\n\nMehta's decision is \"bold in a legally careful way that will do well on appeal,\" said Rebecca Allensworth, an antitrust professor at Vanderbilt Law School. It will \"lay the blueprint for other tech cases going forward.\"", "source": {"uri": "mybroadband.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyBroadband"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Electronics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walmart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kovacic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Kovacic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_University_Law_School", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vanderbilt University Law School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_University_Law_School", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Washington University Law School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AT&T"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google Chrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_George_W._Bush", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of George W.

Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nGoogle almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may land in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nAs expected, Mehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\n\"Advertisers consistently testified that shifting significant ad spending from Google to Bing would be ineffective (and unwise) because of Bing's lack of scale,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\n\"The court confirmed what almost everyone in the industry already knew: that Google is a monopoly and is abusing its power to harm consumers and enrich itself,\" said Roger Alford, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out billions annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said eMarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google. Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives.\"\n\nRegardless she added, a drawn-out appeals process will delay any immediate effects for both consumers and advertisers.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws,\" he said.\n\nThe technology giant is widely expected to appeal against the decision, and the process could take it all the way to the US Supreme Court.\n\n- What does the decision mean for Google and the wider tech sector?\n\nThis is the biggest question to come out of the case.\n\nThe decision by the judge sets up another legal phase where it must be decided what changes or penalties should be imposed on Google in order to protect competition.\n\nThe outcome of that decision could have a huge impact on the tech sector, as the changes could be as drastic as asking the company to dismantle parts of its online empire, or stop it spending huge sums of money each year to ensure Google search is the default search engine on the iPhone and other devices.\n\nOr the judge could decide that only more modest changes are needed to protect competition and consumers, leaving Google relatively unscathed.\n\nAny changes imposed would come at a critical time in the sector, as Google battles with Microsoft and others to lead the industry as it enters the age of AI.", "source": {"uri": "uk.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The ruling paves the way for a second trial to determine potential fixes, possibly including a breakup of Google parent Alphabet, which would change the landscape of the online advertising world that Google has dominated for years.\n\nIt is also a green light to aggressive U.S. antitrust enforcers prosecuting Big Tech, a sector that has been under fire from across the political spectrum. \"The court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, Washington, D.C., wrote. Google controls about 90% of the online search market and 95% on smartphones.\n\nAlphabet said it plans to appeal Mehta's ruling. \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Google said in a statement.U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland called the ruling \"a historic win for the American people,\" adding that \"no company - no matter how large or influential - is above the law.\"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the \"pro-competition ruling is a victory for the American people,\" adding that \"Americans deserve an internet that is free, fair, and open for competition.\"\n\nBILLIONS PAID\n\nMehta noted that Google had paid $26.3 billion in 2021 alone to ensure that its search engine is the default on smartphones and browsers, and to keep its dominant market share.\"The default is extremely valuable real estate,\" Mehta wrote. \"Even if a new entrant were positioned from a quality standpoint to bid for the default when an agreement expires, such a firm could compete only if it were prepared to pay partners upwards of billions of dollars in revenue share and make them whole for any revenue shortfalls resulting from the change.\"\n\nHe added, \"Google, of course, recognizes that losing defaults would dramatically impact its bottom line. For instance, Google has projected that losing the Safari default would result in a significant drop in queries and billions of dollars in lost revenues.\" The ruling is the first major decision in a series of cases taking on alleged monopolies in Big Tech. This case, filed by the Trump administration, went before a judge from September to November of last year.\n\n\"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, who said a drawn-out legal process would delay any immediate effects for consumers.\n\nIn the past four years, federal antitrust regulators have also sued Meta Platforms, Amazon.com and Apple , claiming the companies have illegally maintained monopolies. Those cases all began under the administration of former President Donald Trump.Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, said the fact that the case spanned administrations shows strong bipartisan support for antitrust enforcement.\n\n\"It's a huge victory for the American people that antitrust enforcement is alive and well when it comes to competition,\" she said. \"Google is a rampant monopolist. \"When it was filed in 2020, the Google search case was the first time in a generation that the U.S. government accused a major corporation of an illegal monopoly.

The search engine giant controls about 90 percent of the online search market, and 95 percent on smartphones.\n\nThe \"remedy\" phase could be lengthy, followed by potential appeals to the District of Columbia Circuit and US Supreme Court. The legal wrangling could play out into next year, or even 2026. Shares of Google parent Alphabet fell 4.5 percent on Monday as part of a broad tech share decline. Google advertising was 77 percent of Alphabet's total sales in 2023.\n\nAlphabet said it plans to appeal Mehta's ruling. \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Google said in a statement.\n\nUS Attorney General Merrick Garland called the ruling \"a historic win for the American people,\" adding that \"no company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law.\"\n\nBILLIONS PAID\n\nMehta noted that Google had paid $26.3 billion in 2021 alone to ensure that its search engine is the default on smartphones and browsers, and to keep its dominant market share.\n\n\"The default is extremely valuable real estate ... Even if a new entrant were positioned from a quality standpoint to bid for the default when an agreement expires, such a firm could compete only if it were prepared to pay partners upwards of billions of dollars in revenue share and make them whole for any revenue shortfalls resulting from the change,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nHe added, \"Google, of course, recognizes that losing defaults would dramatically impact its bottom line. For instance, Google has projected that losing the Safari default would result in a significant drop in queries and billions of dollars in lost revenues.\" The ruling is the first major decision in a series of cases taking on alleged monopolies in Big Tech. This case, filed by the Trump administration, went before a judge from September to November of last year.\n\n\"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, who said a drawn-out legal process would delay any immediate effects for consumers.\n\nIn the past four years, federal antitrust regulators have also sued Meta Platforms, Amazon.com and Apple , claiming the companies have illegally maintained monopolies. Those cases all began under the administration of former President Donald Trump.\n\nAmy Klobuchar, a Democratic US senator who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, said the fact that the case spanned administrations shows strong bipartisan support for antitrust enforcement.\n\n\"It's a huge victory for the American people that antitrust enforcement is alive and well when it comes to competition,\" she said. \"Google is a rampant monopolizt.\"\n\nWhen it was filed in 2020, the Google search case was the first time in a generation that the US government accused a major corporation of an illegal monopoly.

The decision, which could significantly disrupt the internet landscape, marks one of the most consequential antitrust rulings in recent history.\n\nThe ruling follows nearly a year of litigation in a trial that pitted the US Justice Department against Google, marking the largest antitrust case in the US in over 25 years.After reviewing extensive evidence and testimony from high-profile executives at Google, Microsoft, and Apple, Judge Mehta issued his 277-page decision three months after final arguments were presented.\n\n'Google is a Monopolist'\n\nJudge Mehta's ruling was unequivocal: \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\" The judge underscored Google's overwhelming control of the search market, citing its 89.2% share of general search services, which soars to 94.9% on mobile devices.\n\nThis decision delivers a significant blow to Google and its parent company, Alphabet Inc., which has long maintained that its market dominance is a result of consumer preference. Google's search engine processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries daily, nearly doubling its volume over the past decade.\n\nDespite the setback, Google plans to appeal the ruling. Kent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, defended the company's practices, saying, \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available.\"\n\nA victory for antitrust regulators\n\nFor the US Justice Department, the ruling represents a substantial victory in its efforts to curb Big Tech's power. Attorney General Merrick Garland hailed the decision as \"an historic win for the American people,\" emphasizing that no company, regardless of size or influence, is above the law.\n\nThe trial cast Google as a technological bully, using its dominance to extract artificially high prices from advertisers while curbing competition. Prosecutors argued that Google's monopoly not only hurt competitors but also diminished the quality of its own service by reducing incentives to innovate.\n\nJudge Mehta's ruling pointed to Google's billions of dollars spent annually to secure its search engine as the default option on devices as a key factor in maintaining its monopoly. In 2021 alone, Google spent over $26 billion to lock in these agreements.\n\nThe path forward\n\nMehta's conclusion sets the stage for a new legal phase focused on determining the remedies required to restore competition. A hearing is scheduled for September 6 to begin discussing potential measures, which could range from dismantling parts of Google's operations to banning default search agreements.\n\nHowever, any significant changes are likely to be delayed by a lengthy appeals process, which experts predict could last up to five years. During this time, Google may fend off immediate restrictions, though it could still face class-action lawsuits from advertisers.\n\nThe ruling also poses potential risks for Apple, which benefits from Google's payments to make its search engine the default on iPhones. Google reportedly paid Apple around $20 billion in 2022 alone, a figure that has doubled since 2020.\n\nImplications for the tech industry\n\nThis decision could have broader implications for the tech industry, particularly for Microsoft, which has been positioning itself as a counterweight to Google in the search market.

For instance, Google has projected that losing the Safari default would result in a significant drop in queries and billions of dollars in lost revenues.\"\n\nThe ruling is the first major decision in a series of cases taking on alleged monopolies in Big Tech. This case, filed by the Trump administration, went before a judge from September to November of last year.\n\n\"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue.

Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nGoogle almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may land in the U..S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out more than $20 billion annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nWATCH: Why the DOJ and 16 states are suing Apple in a landmark antitrust case\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nGoogle still faces other legal threats besides this one, both in the U.S. and abroad. any antitrust lawsuits brought against Google domestically and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.", "source": {"uri":

Image: Pawel Czerwinski/ Unsplash.\n\nA federal judge has ruled that Google violated US antitrust law by maintaining a monopoly in the search and advertising markets. This decision marks a significant victory for the Department of Justice (DOJ) in its ongoing battle against the tech giant.\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Amit Mehta stated, \"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly. It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.\"\n\nMajor victory for the DOJ\n\nJudge Mehta's decision represents a major win for the DOJ, which accused Google of illegally monopolizing the online search market. However, the judge did not support all of the government's claims. He rejected the argument that Google holds monopoly power in a specific segment of the advertising market. Nevertheless, he agreed that Google has a monopoly in \"general search services\" and \"general search text advertising.\"\n\nThe ruling's implications for Google's future remain unclear, as it addresses only the company's liability, not potential remedies. The next phase of proceedings will determine what actions Google must take, which could range from altering business practices to possibly breaking up its search business.\n\nGoogle plans to appeal\n\nGoogle has announced plans to appeal the ruling. Kent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, stated, \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available. As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use.\"\n\nReactions from key players\n\nDOJ antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter hailed the ruling as a landmark decision. \"This landmark decision holds Google accountable. It paves the path for innovation for generations to come and protects access to information for all Americans,\" Kanter said.\n\nDuckDuckGo, a smaller competitor whose CEO testified against Google, also welcomed the ruling. Kamyl Bazbaz, the company's senior vice president for public affairs, remarked, \"The journey ahead will be long. As we are seeing in the EU and other places, Google will do anything it can to avoid changing its conduct. However, we know there is pent-up demand for alternatives in search and this ruling will support access to more options.\"\n\nExamination of Google's practices\n\nJudge Mehta dismissed Google's defense that its contracts with phone and browser makers like Apple were not exclusionary. He highlighted how Google's guaranteed revenue dissuades Apple from launching its own search engine, even though it has the capacity to do so. Mehta drew parallels with the landmark US v. Microsoft case, stating that the same conduct can be exclusionary when performed by a dominant player, regardless of whether it was consistent before and after achieving market dominance.\n\n\"Google's monopoly in general search\" was described as \"remarkably durable,\" with its market share increasing from about 80 percent in 2009 to 90 percent by 2020. In comparison, Bing holds less than 6 percent of the market share. Mehta noted that despite the appearance of competition, Google remains the only real choice for a default general search engine.\n\nImpact on the digital advertising market\n\nMehta's ruling also addressed Google's exclusive agreements in search text advertising, allowing it to raise prices without significant competitive pressure. Google's argument that ad prices, adjusted for quality, had decreased was deemed weak by the judge. He pointed out that Google's practices primarily aimed to drive long-term revenues rather than reflecting principled pricing.\n\nNo sanctions for evidence destruction\n\nAlthough the DOJ requested sanctions against Google for not preserving relevant chat messages, Mehta declined to impose them. He noted that while Google avoided sanctions this time, future cases might not be as lenient.\n\nThis decision is the first in a series of tech monopoly cases initiated by the US government in recent years. Amazon, Apple, and Meta also face monopolization lawsuits. Google is set for another trial in September, focusing on whether it has illegally monopolized digital advertising technology. Mehta's decision may influence how other judges apply antitrust laws to modern digital markets.\n\nThe next steps in this landmark case will determine the future landscape of competition in the search and advertising markets, as the court moves forward to decide on appropriate remedies.", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri":

case - Latest News", "body": "A U.S. judge on Monday handed Google a major legal blow, ruling in a landmark anti-trust case that it has maintained a monopoly with its dominant search engine.\n\nThe court decision against a \"big tech\" giant could alter how the sector operates in future.\n\nDistrict Court Judge Amit Mehta found that Google had a monopoly for search and for text ads through exclusive distribution agreements that made it the \"default\" option that people were likely to use on devices.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote in his ruling.\n\nThe internet behemoth \"has a major, largely unseen advantage over its rivals: default distribution,\" he wrote.\n\nThe anti-trust trial pitting U.S. prosecutors and nearly a dozen states against Google ended in May.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law.\"\n\nGoogle will appeal the verdict, according to global affairs president Kent Walker.\n\nWalker pointed out that Mehta concludes Google is the industry's highest quality search engine, particularly on mobile devices.\n\n\"Given this, and that people are increasingly looking for information in more and more ways, we plan to appeal,\" Walker said.\n\n\"As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use.\"\n\nDamages?\n\nIt remained to be seen what remedies or damages the judge might order in the case.\n\nIn one possible good sign for Google, Mehta concluded in his ruling that the tech titan's violation of the Sherman Act did not have \"anticompetitive effects.\"\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf.\n\n\"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue,\" she added, referring to Google's parent company.\n\nEven losing the option of making exclusive deals to be the default option on browsers, smartphones or computers would hurt Google, according to the analyst.\n\nGoogle's search business would be hampered as generative artificial intelligence wielded by Microsoft's Bing and OpenAI budding \"SearchGPT\" ramp up competition.\n\n\"The biggest winner from today's ruling isn't consumers or little tech, it's Microsoft,\" said Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich.\n\n\"Microsoft has underinvested in search for decades, but today's ruling opens the door to a court mandate of default deals for Bing.\"\n\nMitchell-Wolf expected a drawn-out appeals process to delay any immediate effects of the verdict on consumers or advertisers.\n\nThe trial was the first time the U.S. Department of Justice has faced a big tech company in court since Microsoft was targeted more than two decades ago over the dominance of its Windows operating system.\n\nMehta presided over several months of testimony late last year that saw Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other top executives take the stand.\n\nAt the heart of the government's case was the massive payments made by Google to Apple and other companies to keep its world-leading search engine as the default on iPhones, web browsers and other products.\n\nCourt testimony revealed that these payments reach the tens of billions of dollars every year to keep its prime real estate on Apple hardware or the Safari and Mozilla browsers.\n\nJustice department lawyers argued that Google achieved and perpetuated its dominance -- and strangled rivals -- through these default deals that also expanded to Samsung and other device makers.", "source": {"uri": "hurriyetdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

If you'd like to sign up to receive issues over email, you can do so here.\n\nToday is a big day for American business.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence,\" wrote Judge Amit Mehta in his decision of the case United States of America vs Google LLC, \"the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly. It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.\"\n\nFifteen years after it was first investigated, search giant Google is finally going to be held accountable for unfairly thwarting competition. In this piece, I'm going to discuss the complaint against Google, why it lost, the next steps, and what this case means for American business going forward.\n\nMake no mistake, this decision is huge for Google, the web, and the revival of monopolization law against giants across the economy. It's also a big deal for the BIG community. We've been writing about this case, covering antitrust law, filing comments, contacting policymakers and pushing for aggressive enforcement for almost five years. Subscribers to BIG helped finance the special site Big Tech on Trial, where we hired a reporter to cover the case and helped ensure that the judge didn't keep key evidence behind closed doors.\n\nSo this victory is not just for the public, it is in a sense by the public.\n\nThe government's case against Google was simple. The search giant pays tens of billions of dollars a year to companies that distribute search engines - Apple, LG, Motorola, Samsung, AT&T, T-Mobile, Mozilla, Opera, UCWeb, and Verizon - to make sure it was the only search engine consumers saw. A colleague described the case in 2020:\n\nThe government is saying that Google put its search engine in front of consumers so rivals - like Bing or DuckDuckGo - never get a chance to compete. The most important way to distribute search engines is to be the preset default general search engine on a device; most consumers simply never change their defaults. To take advantage of this dynamic, Google has agreements with mobile phone companies like Apple and Samsung, wireless carriers like AT&T and Verizon, and browser companies like Mozilla to gain default status for Google.\n\nIn other words, it bought up all the shelf space. Such a tactic, a monopolist paying off partners to prevent distribution of a rival, is called \"monopoly maintenance.\"\n\nIn digital markets, monopolization is meaningful for a specific reason. When a search engine gets a lot of users, it learns what users click on, and can tweak results to make them better and more relevant. In other words, the use of the product actually improves the product. So Google's ability to deny scale and data to rivals meant that no one could get enough information to produce a sufficiently high quality service to foster actual competition.\n\nSo what's the harm? As Yosef Weisman put it in on Big Tech on Trial:\n\nThe alleged harms of this monopoly maintenance are what you'd expect. The government argues it allowed Google to raise prices for advertisers without regard to the prices of ads on other digital platforms, and has allowed Google to forgo quality improvements in privacy and other areas that it would have otherwise pursued. Consumers are also deprived of the potential for a higher-quality search engine that could emerge if there was healthier competition.\n\nPoor quality search costs lives, as Dave Dayen wrote in 2017 when showing how Google's bad stewardship of its search engine directed users to bad rehab clinics.\n\nA more tangible way to show the costs for everyone is as follows. In the late 2010s, Apple began building a search engine to compete with Google, which it would presumably use as its default for the iPhone. Here, for instance, is a story from 2020 in the Financial Times.\n\nBut then Apple stopped development, because Google's sharing of monopoly rents from its search engine was too lucrative to be ignored. Apple now earns tens of billions of dollars from Google for putting Google as the preset default on its Safari browser, with virtually no cost. The public, advertisers, and websites are deprived of competition from an Apple search.\n\nThe key question for Judge Mehta was whether default arrangements were mechanisms to monopolize or just smart business. \"If defaults matter a lot,\" Weisman wrote in The Power of Defaults early in the trial, \"that suggests that consumers aren't necessarily using Google because of its quality. But if defaults don't matter that much, that strengthens Google's claim that people use Google because it's the best.\"\n\nIt turns out that Judge Mehta thinks defaults matter, a lot. \"Google,\" he wrote, \"has a major, largely unseen advantage over its rivals: default distribution.\"\n\nMehta quoted Google's behavioral economics team in 2021 discussing how much defaults matter, noting consumers don't change their search engine very often, if ever. \"Inertia is the path of the least resistance,\" this team said internally. \"People tend to stick with the status quo, as it takes more effort to make changes.\" Mehta further observed that because of Google's set of contracts, only 30% of consumers ever get the chance to have access to the web without being defaulted to Google. That is, 70% of the market is foreclosed to competition.\n\nAs I noted above, the most obvious potential rival in search would have been Apple, because it had the distribution capacity through its iPhone to source a different search engine or build its own. I thought this dynamic was compelling, and so, apparently, did Judge Mehta. Apple would not distribute a rival search product because its revenue share with Google was so lucrative. The phone maker did not seriously consider Microsoft's Bing as a replacement for Google, since the economics of search were such that Microsoft would have had to offer more than 100% of its revenue share to compete.\n\nAnd, unsurprisingly, Google was willing to pay a lot to be the default for Apple's Safari for a reason. Internal Google documents suggested they'd lose between 60-80% of its mobile search were they to lose the default position on the iPhone, translating into a revenue loss of between $28.2-32.7 billion, numbers Mehta highlighted in his decision.\n\n\"The prospect,\" Mehta wrote, \"of losing tens of billions in guaranteed revenue from Google -- which presently come at little to no cost to Apple -- disincentivizes Apple from launching its own search engine when it otherwise has built the capacity to do so.\"\n\nIn terms of the legal elements of his decision, Judge Mehta found that Google's violations amounted to 'exclusive dealing,' which is to say cutting deals to make sure it was the only product distributed to a substantial share of the market. Monopolization can happen if rivals are cut off from just 40-50% of the market, or even less, and Google's exclusive contracts certainly met that threshold.\n\nMehta also pointed to the FTC's recent IQVIA merger decision in determining how online advertising markets work, cited old powerful cases like American Tobacco (1946) which stated that merely being a monopolist is unlawful, and dismissed the emergence of artificial intelligence as meaningfully changing search market dynamics.\n\nMehta made two points in favor of Google. First, he dismissed the claims of the states, which had argued that Google didn't allow Microsoft to connect with Google's advertising tools. And second, he chose not to sanction Google's general counsel for destroying evidence, but said that was only because he found Google's conduct unlawful. \"The court is taken aback by the lengths to which Google goes to avoid creating a paper trail for regulators and litigants,\" Mehta wrote. \"It is no wonder then that this case has lacked the kind of nakedly anticompetitive communications seen in Microsoft and other Section 2 cases.\" Google got lucky, he said, because sanctioning would have made no difference in the outcome, so he didn't bother to do it.\n\nFundamentally, this case is about two different visions of the internet. Google has tried to portray itself as an upstart fighting for innovation in an open web. The company likes to portray itself as having been founded in a rented garage, when competition was merely a click away. However, Mehta didn't buy it. \"The internet of today is a far different animal,\" he said in his opinion. \"Hundreds of millions of dollars is just the opening ante to enter the search market in part because of the internet's dramatic growth; billions are needed to acquire meaningful market share. The next great search engine (if there is to be one) will not be built in a rented garage like Google.\"\n\nThis part of the trial was what is called the liability phase, which is to determine whether Google broke the law. Judge Mehta found that it did. The next stage is called the remedy phase, during which the court will hear arguments about what to do to address the bad conduct. He has ordered both parties to propose a schedule for the remedy phase by September 4.\n\nNo doubt Google will appeal, and will ask for the remedy phase to be delayed while it does so. I doubt Google will be able to delay the remedy phase while its appeals happen, but the law there isn't crystal clear. I don't think Google's appeal will succeed, Mehta's decision is tightly written and if Google isn't a monopoly, then antitrust law is really a dead letter.\n\nHowever, the risk here is political. I don't have any confidence in either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris to continue this antitrust regime, and they will both be tempted to settle this case, and others like it, on the cheap. Congress won't be happy if they do that, and neither will the media. So I don't think it's likely that they do end this case, but it's something that worries me.\n\nIn terms of remedies, it's not totally clear what the government will ask for. I have faith in the Antitrust Division leader, Jonathan Kanter, who has shown foresight and courage in his job.\n\nLegally speaking, Judge Mehta has broad latitude to craft a remedy, though Mehta is quite cautious. He will likely end the exclusive dealing contracts. But he could go much further, breaking up Google, separating out Android and Chrome from the search function. He could force Google to share its ill-gotten data with rivals to let them create quality products, or he could mandate they delete it. Technical oversight committees, break-ups, choice screens, interoperability, and prohibitions on self-preferencing of Google products are all possibilities. Six months ago, tech incubator YCombinator and Bloomberg held a conference called Remedy Fest, with discussions of all of these options.\n\nRegardless, the immediate impact of this decision will start tomorrow, as venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and executives begin planning for the end of Apple's deal with Google and the $20+ billion of free money that structures the web. That Safari search default is immensely valuable, and Apple isn't going to waste it.\n\nThe implications of this decision are too broad to really convey in one issue of BIG, it's one of those legal decisions that will have ripple effects across the internet, the law, and big business for generations.\n\nLet's start by putting it in context for Google. We have to remember that this monopolization case isn't Google's first. Last December, Google lost a monopolization case in a jury trial to Epic Games, which claimed Google monopolized access to mobile app stores. The judge is nearly done with the remedy phase, which could revolutionize mobile phones. Google is also facing a different case on its control of advertising software, in a trial starting next month.\n\nBut this case is critical to freeing the web. As a colleague once told me, \"Going after Google for anything but search is like trying to deal with Standard Oil without touching oil.\" So there we go, Google's control of the web is ending.\n\nWhat will a non-Google dominated web look like? Well, it's hard to know, but I think there's a vision tucked in an April speech by Federal Trade Commission consumer protection chief Sam Levine on how the internet didn't have to become the cesspool that it is today. He sketched out what the internet could become if well-regulated, a place where we have zones of privacy, where not everything operates like a casino, and where AI works for us. This case brings us a step closer to Levine's vision, because it means that people who want to build better safer products now have the chance to compete.\n\nSo that's Google. What about the rest of business? Well, this decision means monopolization law is back. Exclusive contracts and arrangements are pervasive in American commerce, and until recently, executives could reliably exploit such deals without fearing that they might face any legal liability. But that era is over. This case is in the headlines, which means every single competent executive in America in any firm with market power is going to get a memo from their antitrust or general counsel on what they can and can't do going forward. And they will likely begin changing their behavior so avoid being brought to court for monopolization.\n\nAnd that, more than almost anything, is what the rule of law means.\n\nThanks for reading.

Credit: David Gray/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nGoogle has just lost a massive antitrust lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice that has huge ramifications for big tech companies and Google Search users.\n\nOn Monday, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google had indeed violated federal antitrust law in order to make sure Google Search was the dominant search product online.\n\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" wrote Judge Mehta in the opinion.\n\nThe main issue at hand here in this case was the financial agreements that Google had with other companies in order to make sure Google Search was the default search engine in products such as Apple's Safari web browser.\n\nGoogle pays Apple a whopping $20 billion a year in order to maintain its position as the default search engine on Safari for iOS, for example.

However, it's not yet clear what this will mean for the future of Google's business since this is about Google's liability and not about remedies. This is the first monopoly case in a wave of cases brought on by the US government recently. It's been nearly two decades since the last major monopoly case, which was against Microsoft. The government is also suing Amazon, Apple, and Meta for monopolistic practices.\n\nThroughout the ten-week trial that Judge Mehta oversaw, Google continued to argue that it was not acting anti-competitive and that its large market share was a result of creating a superior product. Google also argued that its search business should be compared to a much larger range of peers than the government proposed in its market definition. Arguing that it competes directly with other platforms where search is a bit part of business, even if they aren't indexing the web - like Amazon.\n\nIn this case, we also learned how much Google is paying Apple to remain the default search engine on the iPhone (and iPad). That's $20 billion in 2022 alone. Google also let it slip that it pays 36% of search ad revenue from Safari with Apple. Which by itself is very monopolistic.\n\nAs for what's next, another antitrust trial between the DOJ and Google is set to start on September 9.

anti-trust case - Companies - The Jakarta Post", "body": "US judge on Monday handed Google a major legal blow, ruling in a landmark anti-trust case that it has maintained a monopoly with its dominant search engine.\n\nThe court decision against a \"big tech\" giant could alter how the sector operates in future.\n\nDistrict Court Judge Amit Mehta found that Google had a monopoly for search and for text ads through exclusive distribution agreements that made it the \"default\" option that people were likely to use on devices.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote in his ruling.\n\nThe internet behemoth \"has a major, largely unseen advantage over its rivals: default distribution,\" he wrote.\n\nThe anti-trust trial pitting US prosecutors and nearly a dozen states against Google ended in May.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said US Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law.\"\n\nGoogle will appeal the verdict, according to global affairs president Kent Walker.\n\nWalker pointed out that Mehta concludes Google is the industry's highest quality search engine, particularly on mobile devices.\n\n\"Given this, and that people are increasingly looking for information in more and more ways, we plan to appeal,\" Walker said.\n\n\"As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use.\"\n\nDamages?\n\nIt remained to be seen what remedies or damages the judge might order in the case.\n\nIn one possible good sign for Google, Mehta concluded in his ruling that the tech titan's violation of the Sherman Act did not have \"anticompetitive effects.\"\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf.\n\n\"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue,\" she added, referring to Google's parent company.\n\nEven losing the option of making exclusive deals to be the default option on browsers, smartphones or computers would hurt Google, according to the analyst.\n\nGoogle's search business would be hampered as generative artificial intelligence wielded by Microsoft's Bing and OpenAI budding \"SearchGPT\" ramp up competition.\n\n\"The biggest winner from today's ruling isn't consumers or little tech, it's Microsoft,\" said Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich.\n\n\"Microsoft has underinvested in search for decades, but today's ruling opens the door to a court mandate of default deals for Bing.\"\n\nMitchell-Wolf expected a drawn-out appeals process to delay any immediate effects of the verdict on consumers or advertisers.\n\nThe trial was the first time the US Department of Justice has faced a big tech company in court since Microsoft was targeted more than two decades ago over the dominance of its Windows operating system.\n\nMehta presided over several months of testimony late last year that saw Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other top executives take the stand.\n\nAt the heart of the government's case was the massive payments made by Google to Apple and other companies to keep its world-leading search engine as the default on iPhones, web browsers and other products.\n\nCourt testimony revealed that these payments reach the tens of billions of dollars every year to keep its prime real estate on Apple hardware or the Safari and Mozilla browsers.\n\nJustice department lawyers argued that Google achieved and perpetuated its dominance -- and strangled rivals -- through these default deals that also expanded to Samsung and other device makers.", "source": {"uri": "thejakartapost.com",

"body": "Several months of testimony saw Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other top executives take the stand (JUSTIN SULLIVAN/AFP)\n\nA U.S. judge on Monday handed Google a major legal blow, ruling in a landmark anti-trust case that it has maintained a monopoly with its dominant search engine.\n\nThe court decision against a \"big tech\" giant could alter how the sector operates in future.\n\nDistrict Court Judge Amit Mehta found that Google had a monopoly for search and for text ads through exclusive distribution agreements that made it the \"default\" option that people were likely to use on devices.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote in his ruling.\n\nThe internet behemoth \"has a major, largely unseen advantage over its rivals: default distribution,\" he wrote.\n\nThe anti-trust trial pitting US prosecutors and nearly a dozen states against Google ended in May.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said US Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law.\"\n\nGoogle will appeal the verdict, according to global affairs president Kent Walker.\n\nWalker pointed out that Mehta concludes Google is the industry's highest quality search engine, particularly on mobile devices.\n\n\"Given this, and that people are increasingly looking for information in more and more ways, we plan to appeal,\" Walker said.\n\n\"As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use.\"\n\n- Damages? -\n\nIt remained to be seen what remedies or damages the judge might order in the case.\n\nIn one possible good sign for Google, Mehta concluded in his ruling that the tech titan's violation of the Sherman Act did not have \"anticompetitive effects.\"\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf.\n\n\"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue,\" she added, referring to Google's parent company.\n\nEven losing the option of making exclusive deals to be the default option on browsers, smartphones or computers would hurt Google, according to the analyst.\n\nGoogle's search business would be hampered as generative artificial intelligence wielded by Microsoft's Bing and OpenAI budding \"SearchGPT\" ramp up competition.\n\n\"The biggest winner from today's ruling isn't consumers or little tech, it's Microsoft,\" said Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich.\n\n\"Microsoft has underinvested in search for decades, but today's ruling opens the door to a court mandate of default deals for Bing.\"\n\nMitchell-Wolf expected a drawn-out appeals process to delay any immediate effects of the verdict on consumers or advertisers.\n\nThe trial was the first time the US Department of Justice has faced a big tech company in court since Microsoft was targeted more than two decades ago over the dominance of its Windows operating system.\n\nMehta presided over several months of testimony late last year that saw Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other top executives take the stand.\n\nAt the heart of the government's case was the massive payments made by Google to Apple and other companies to keep its world-leading search engine as the default on iPhones, web browsers and other products.\n\nCourt testimony revealed that these payments reach the tens of billions of dollars every year to keep its prime real estate on Apple hardware or the Safari and Mozilla browsers.\n\nJustice department lawyers argued that Google achieved and perpetuated its dominance -- and strangled rivals -- through these default deals that also expanded to Samsung and other device makers.", "source": {"uri": "rawstory.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Raw Story"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki",

The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws,\" he said.\n\nThe technology giant is widely expected to appeal against the decision, and the process could take it all the way to the US Supreme Court.\n\n- What does the decision mean for Google and the wider tech sector?\n\nThis is the biggest question to come out of the case.\n\nThe decision by the judge sets up another legal phase where it must be decided what changes or penalties should be imposed on Google in order to protect competition.\n\nThe outcome of that decision could have a huge impact on the tech sector, as the changes could be as drastic as asking the company to dismantle parts of its online empire, or stop it spending huge sums of money each year to ensure Google search is the default search engine on the iPhone and other devices.\n\nOr the judge could decide that only more modest changes are needed to protect competition and consumers, leaving Google relatively unscathed.\n\nAny changes imposed would come at a critical time in the sector, as Google battles with Microsoft and others to lead the industry as it enters the age of AI.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/06/11/ce7535efc0d28e8a158ae4d1df22b127Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzIzMDI0OTE5-2.25366190.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nGoogle almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may land in the U..S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out more than $20 billion annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nGoogle still faces other legal threats besides this one, both in the U.S. and abroad. any antitrust lawsuits brought against Google domestically and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

It also holds Google was unable to offer justifications for said exclusivity deals.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly. It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.\n\n\"Google's distribution agreements are exclusive and have anticompetitive effects,\" it continues. It also states it uses that monopoly to charge \"supracompetitive prices for general search text ads\", i.e. those above sustainable market prices. It says Google was able to \"increase text ad prices without any meaningful competitive constraint.\"\n\nIt's not all bad for Google. The court also found that the company did not have a monopoly power in search advertising. It also said of the search engine giant that it is \"widely recognized as the best GSE available in the United States.\"\n\nA silver lining, of sorts? That was, after all, the pitch of Google's defence. It argued that it was the better product to other search engines.\n\nOne quote cited in the ruling is from Apple's Senior Vice President of Services, Eddy Cue, who reportedly said: \"[T]here's no price that Microsoft could ever offer [Apple]\" to switch to Bing.\n\nGoogle also managed to avoid a slap on the wrist for its decision to destroy many internal chat messages.\n\n\"Any company that puts the onus on its employees to identify and preserve relevant evidence does so at its own peril. Google avoided sanctions in this case. It may not be so lucky in the next one,\" Mehta says.\n\nThat won't do much to stop Google from fighting the ruling. Google's president of global affairs, Kent Walker, said in a statement (via The Guardian): \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available.\"\n\nThe US attorney general Merrick Garland called the ruling \"a historic win for the American people\".

Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nGoogle almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may land in the U..S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out more than $20 billion annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nGoogle still faces other legal threats besides this one, both in the U.S. and abroad. any antitrust lawsuits brought against Google domestically and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.", "source": {"uri": "newson6.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News On 6"}, "authors": [{"uri": "griffin_media@newson6.com", "name": "Griffin Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet of things"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://hot-town-images.s3.amazonaws.com/kotv/production/2022/August/18/google-sign.1660851971646.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

To the contrary, it would artificially prop up lower-quality search alternatives, raise phone prices, and make it harder for people to get the search services they want to use.\"\n\nAccording to BBC News, in his ruling on Monday, Mehta said Google paid billions to secure its position as the default search engine on smartphones and browsers.\n\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta said.\n\nThe ruling comes after a 10-week trial in Washington DC, in which prosecutors accused Google of spending billions of dollars annually to Apple, Samsung, Mozilla and others to be pre-installed as the default search engine across platforms.\n\nThe US said Google pays more than $10 billion a year for that privilege, securing its access to a steady stream of user data that helped maintain its hold on the market.\n\nProsecutors said doing so meant other companies did not have the opportunity or resources to meaningfully compete.\n\nThe judge concluded that being the default search engine is \"extremely valuable real estate\" for Google.\n\n\"Even if a new entrant were positioned from a quality standpoint to bid for the default when an agreement expires,

Judge Amit Mehta's decision noted that Google had perpetuated its monopoly through specific strategies that violated section 2 of the Sherman Act.\n\nWe obtained a copy of the ruling for you here.\n\nThe lawsuit, which commenced in 2020, later expanded to include multiple states and territories, encapsulating the gravity and scale of the legal scrutiny Google faces. Early in the trial, government attorney Kenneth Dintzer articulated that the proceedings would significantly influence the future of internet governance.\n\nThe trial's largely private proceedings sparked criticism from transparency advocates, who accused Google of trying to minimize public oversight and media exposure. Google had successfully argued that opening up the trial fully would risk exposing sensitive trade secrets.\n\nIn his detailed ruling, Judge Mehta highlighted that the evidence and testimonies reviewed throughout the trial led to the unequivocal conclusion that Google was engaging in monopolistic practices. \"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" he stated.\n\nThe case, marking one of the most significant antitrust judgments in recent decades, was the result of a major legal challenge initiated by the Justice Department. It reflects a broader governmental and international effort to regulate the expansive power of major tech entities.\n\nThe proceedings began in September of the previous year and featured a notable break, allowing Judge Mehta time to deliberate before concluding in early May.\n\nThroughout the trial, federal prosecutors presented their case that Google maintained its search engine supremacy unlawfully, leveraging hefty financial agreements with companies like Apple and Samsung. This enabled Google to set itself as the default search engine across numerous devices, an advantage that Judge Mehta found to be unfairly limiting competition.\n\nThe financial scope of these agreements was substantial, with Google disbursing over $26 billion in 2021 to secure default status on various devices, a practice that the court criticized for lacking legitimate justification.\n\nWhile the ruling stops short of detailing the potential penalties Google may face, it raises significant questions about the future operational landscape for Google's search engine business. An appeal from Google is anticipated.\n\nDefending its practices, Google asserted that its search services were superior to competitors like Microsoft's Bing, arguing that its default engine agreements did not infringe antitrust laws.\n\nFurthermore, Google's legal team urged for a broader interpretation of the search market, suggesting that Google is one among many platforms that facilitate online searches, including tech giants like TikTok and Amazon.\n\nAnother significant aspect of the trial was the scrutiny of Google's internal communication practices. The tech giant was criticized for not preserving chat records, which the government claimed could contain evidence detrimental to Google's defense. Although Judge Mehta expressed disappointment over Google's document retention practices, he opted not to sanction the company for these actions.\n\nLooking ahead, Google is set to contend with another Justice Department lawsuit focused on its advertising techniques and alleged monopolistic behaviors in ad technology later this year.", "source": {"uri": "reclaimthenet.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reclaim The Net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_frieth@reclaimthenet.org", "name": "Dan Frieth", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sherman Antitrust Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_secret", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade secret"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/googe-3e-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Google controls about 90 per cent of the online search market and 95 per cent on smartphones.\n\nThe \"remedy\" phase could be lengthy, followed by potential appeals to the US Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit and the US Supreme Court. The legal wrangling could play out into next year, or even 2026.\n\nShares of Alphabet fell 4.5 per cent yesternday amid a broad decline in tech shares as the wider stock market cratered on recession fears. Google advertising was 77 per cent of Alphabet's total sales in 2023.\n\nAlphabet said it plans to appeal Mehta's ruling. \"This decision recognises that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Google said in a statement.\n\nUS Attorney General Merrick Garland called the ruling \"a historic win for the American people,\" adding that \"no company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the \"pro-competition ruling is a victory for the American people,\" adding that \"Americans deserve an internet that is free, fair, and open for competition.\"\n\nBillions paid\n\nMehta noted that Google had paid US$26.3 billion in 2021 alone to ensure that its search engine is the default on smartphones and browsers, and to keep its dominant market share.\n\n\"The default is extremely valuable real estate,\" Mehta wrote. \"Even if a new entrant were positioned from a quality standpoint to bid for the default when an agreement expires, such a firm could compete only if it were prepared to pay partners upwards of billions of dollars in revenue share and make them whole for any revenue shortfalls resulting from the change.\"\n\nHe added, \"Google, of course, recognizes that losing defaults would dramatically impact its bottom line. For instance, Google has projected that losing the Safari default would result in a significant drop in queries and billions of dollars in lost revenues.\"\n\nThe ruling is the first major decision in a series of cases taking on alleged monopolies in Big Tech. This case, filed by the Trump administration, went before a judge from September to November of last year.\n\n\"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, who said a drawn-out legal process would delay any immediate effects for consumers.\n\nIn the past four years, federal antitrust regulators have also sued Meta Platforms, Amazon.com and Apple, claiming the companies have illegally maintained monopolies.\n\nThose cases all began under the administration of former president Donald Trump.\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, said the fact that the case spanned administrations shows strong bipartisan support for antitrust enforcement.\n\n\"It's a huge victory for the American people that antitrust enforcement is alive and well when it comes to competition,\" she said. \"Google is a rampant monopolist.\"\n\nWhen it was filed in 2020, the Google search case was the first time in a generation that the US government accused a major corporation of an illegal monopoly. Microsoft settled with the Justice Department in 2004 over claims that it forced its Internet Explorer Web browser on Windows users. -- Reuters", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com", "dataType": "news",

The search engine giant controls about 90 per cent of the online search market, and 95 per cent on smartphones.\n\nThe \"remedy\" phase could be lengthy, followed by potential appeals to the DC Circuit and US Supreme Court. The legal wrangling could play out into next year, or even 2026.\n\nShares of Google parent Alphabet fell 4.3 per cent on Aug 5 as part of a broad tech share decline. Google advertising was 77 per cent of Alphabet's total sales in 2023.\n\nAlphabet said it plans to appeal Judge Mehta's ruling. \"This decision recognises that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Google said in a statement.\n\nUS Attorney General Merrick Garland called the ruling \"a historic win for the American people\", adding that \"no company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law\".\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the \"pro-competition ruling is a victory for the American people\", adding that \"Americans deserve an internet that is free, fair, and open for competition\".\n\nJudge Mehta noted that Google had paid US$26.3 billion (S$34.8 billion) in 2021 alone to ensure that its search engine is the default on smartphones and browsers, and to keep its dominant market share.\n\n\"The default is extremely valuable real estate... Even if a new entrant were positioned from a quality standpoint to bid for the default when an agreement expires, such a firm could compete only if it were prepared to pay partners upwards of billions of dollars in revenue share and make them whole for any revenue shortfalls resulting from the change,\" the judge wrote.\n\nHe noted \"Google, of course, recognises that losing defaults would dramatically impact its bottom line. For instance, Google has projected that losing the Safari default would result in a significant drop in queries and billions of dollars in lost revenues\".\n\nThe ruling is the first major decision in a series of cases taking on alleged monopolies in Big Tech. This case, filed by the Trump administration, went before a judge from September to November.\n\n\"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, who noted a drawn out legal process will delay any immediate effects for consumers.\n\nIn the past four years, federal antitrust regulators have also sued Meta Platforms, Amazon.com, and Apple, claiming the companies have illegally maintained monopolies. Those cases all began under the administration of former President Donald Trump.\n\nAmy Klobuchar, a Democratic US senator who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, said the fact that the case spanned administrations shows strong bipartisan support for antitrust enforcement.\n\n\"It's a huge victory for the American people that antitrust enforcement is alive and well when it comes to competition,\" she said. \"Google is a rampant monopolist.\"\n\nWhen it was filed in 2020, the Google search case was the first time in a generation that the US government accused a major corporation of an illegal monopoly. Microsoft settled with the Justice Department in 2004 over claims that it forced its Internet Explorer web browser on Windows users.", "source": {"uri": "asiaone.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Supreme Court.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating its efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year.\n\nRELATED STORY | European regulators probe Apple, Google and Meta under new digital law\n\nJustice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of being able to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nRELATED STORY | DOJ sues Apple in sweeping antitrust suit over iPhone monopoly in US\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out more than $20 billion annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices.\n\nAfter the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.", "source": {"uri": "wptv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WPTV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. Ng Han Guan/Associated Press, file\n\nWASHINGTON -- A judge on Monday ruled that Google's ubiquitous search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the internet and hobble one of the world's best-known companies.\n\nThe highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S. Department of Justice against Google in the country's biggest antitrust showdown in a quarter of a century.\n\nAfter reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year's 10-week trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early May.\n\nIt represents a major setback for Google and its parent company, Alphabet Inc., which had steadfastly argued that its popularity stemmed from consumers' overwhelming desire to use a search engine so good at what it does that it has become synonymous with looking things up online. Google's search engine processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly double its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nGoogle almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was president and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Biden's administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine - a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo - now a minor player on the internet - was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out more than $20 billion annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software-maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways, and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but it now trails its rival, with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with AI, I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nGoogle still faces other legal threats besides this one, both in the U.S. and abroad. any antitrust lawsuits brought against Google domestically and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.\n\nCopy the Story

The court focused on Google's exclusive search agreements with Apple and Android-powered smartphones and tablets. In 2020, Google was the target of parallel but distinct antitrust lawsuits by the Department of Justice and a bipartisan coalition of solicitors general from 38 states and territories, headed by Colorado and Nebraska. Google loses in Court\n\nThe landmark case from the government, filed in 2020, alleged that Google has kept its share of the general search market by creating strong barriers to entry and a feedback loop that has sustained its dominance. The court found that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which outlaws monopolies.\n\nThe ruling marks the first anti-monopoly decision against a tech company in decades.\n\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Judge Amit Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia wrote in the decision.\n\nThe Department of Justice and a bipartisan group of attorneys general from 38 states and territories, led by Colorado and Nebraska, filed similar but separate antitrust suits against Google in 2020. The suits were combined for pretrial purposes, such as the discovery of evidence.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland called the decision a \"historic win for the American people.\"\n\n\"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\" Garland wrote in a statement.\n\nThe Court's ruling\n\nIn its ruling, the court homed in on Google's exclusive search arrangements on Android and Apple's iPhone and iPad devices, saying that they helped to cement Google's anticompetitive behavior and dominance over the search markets.\n\nGeneral search services, according to the court, applies to Google's core search engine, where it traditionally competed with Yahoo. General search text advertising refers to the text ads that run alongside search results. The court ruled that in both of those areas, Google has operated as a monopoly. However, the ruling found that general search advertising is not a market so there can be no monopoly control.\n\nKent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said in a statement that the company plans to appeal the ruling. He highlighted the court's emphasis on the quality of Google's products.\n\n\"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available. As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use,\" Walker wrote.\n\nAlphabet shares fell more than 4% on Monday, dragged down by a broad decline in stocks worldwide.\n\nFinancial Impact\n\nThe financial implications of the ruling could be substantial for Google. The company spent around $26 billion in 2021 to be the default search engine for various smartphone makers, with Apple's cut being about $18 billion.\n\nIn 2022, this figure climbed to an eye-watering $20 billion. The ruling could lead to changes in Google's search-engine contracts and potentially bar the company from making future deals around its search engine.\n\nThe decision also comes at a time when other tech giants are facing similar regulatory battles. The DOJ filed an antitrust suit against Apple in March, alleging that the iPhone maker was suppressing app development and worsening the quality of cross-platform messaging.\n\nIn September, the FTC sued Amazon for inflating prices on its marketplace and overcharging smaller sellers. The agency has also sued Meta in a bid to force it to sell Instagram and WhatsApp, which it said marked a monopoly.\n\nRelated Items:Antitrust case, Google, text advertising Recommended for you

Google rivals like Microsoft accused the tech giant of buying its way into dominance. Google argued users chose its search engine for quality, not because it was the default setting, but the judge disagreed.\n\nDid you know that Google has been embroiled in a legal battle since 2020? You'd be forgiven if you didn't, as it hasn't been at the forefront of the news for a while now. However, the case has finally wrapped up with a pretty big result; the US Department of Justice has found Google guilty of breaching antitrust laws.\n\n2:23\n\nRelated\n\nGoogle Pixel 8a review: A great mid-ranger with Google's best AI tools for half the price\n\nGoogle made the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro the first real \"AI smartphones,\" and that now extends to the $500 Pixel 8a.\n\nThe US DOJ finds Google guilty of using antitrust to establish a search engine monopoly\n\nAs reported by Axios, Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has declared that Google has been breaching antitrust laws to establish itself as a monopoly in the search engine market.\n\nBoth sides had put forward their arguments. Search engine rivals, such as Microsoft with its Bing engine and DuckDuckGo, accused Google of buying its way into a monopoly. The main example they gave was how Google paid Apple billions of dollars every year to set its search engine as the default option for the Safari search engine. Google's rivals stated that they were never given the offer to buy their way into Safari's default search engine, and even if they were, it became a case of who had the most money to throw around.\n\nGoogle's argument was that people weren't using its search engine because it was the default option. Instead, users were simply pleased with Google's quality of service, and therefore personally opted to use its search engine versus its competitors. However, the judge ruled that \"Google did not provide a valid argument as to why [the contracts] exist\" and found the tech giant guilty of antitrust.\n\nThere's still a lot to go through; for example, the lawsuit was set up to see if Google was guilty of antitrust, so the DOJ hasn't established what ti wants Google to do in light of this. And as Axios mentions, there's a near-guaranteed chance that Google is going to appeal it. Until then, it's a large victory for search engines living under Google's shadow.", "source": {"uri": "xda-developers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "XDA-Developers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_batt@xda-developers.com", "name": "Simon Batt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Pixel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google Pixel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the District of Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDuckGo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DuckDuckGo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Engineering", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Academic Departments", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Information_Retrieval", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Information Retrieval", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Search_Engines", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Search Engines", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/google-logo-building.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

It is likely to influence other government antitrust lawsuits against Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nThe ruling did not include remedies for Google's behaviour. Mehta will now decide that, potentially forcing the company to change the way it runs or to sell off part of its business.\n\nThe ruling capped a yearslong case -- US et al. v. Google -- that resulted in a 10-week trial last year. The Justice Department and states sued in 2020 over Google's dominance in online search, which generates billions in profits annually. The Justice Department said Google's search engine conducted nearly 90% of web searches, a number the company disputed.\n\nThe company spends billions of dollars annually to be the automatic search engine on browsers like Apple's Safari and Mozilla's Firefox. Google paid Apple about $18 billion for being the default in 2021, The New York Times reported.\n\nDuring the trial, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified that he was concerned that his competitor's dominance had created a \"Google web\" and that its relationship with Apple was \"oligopolistic.\" If Google continued undeterred, it was likely to become dominant in the race to develop artificial intelligence, he said.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai countered in his testimony that Google created a better service for consumers.\n\nUsers choose to search on Google because they find it useful, and the company has continued to invest to make it better, the company's lawyers said.\n\n\"Google is winning because it's better,\" John Schmidtlein, Google's lead courtroom lawyer, said during closing arguments, which were held months later, in May.\n\nThe government argued that by paying billions of dollars to be the automatic search engine on consumer devices, Google had denied its competitors the opportunity to build the scale required to compete with its search engine. Instead, Google collected more data about consumers that it used to make its search engine better and more dominant.\n\nThe government also accused Google of protecting a monopoly over the ads that run inside search results. Government lawyers said Google had raised the price of ads beyond the rates that should exist in a free market, which they argued was a sign of the company's power. Search ads provide billions of dollars in annual revenue for Google.\n\nDuring closing arguments, Mehta grilled the lawyers about factual statements and asked them to explain how their cases squared with legal precedent.\n\n\"The importance and significance of this case is not lost on me, not only for Google but for the public,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sundar Pichai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firefox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/v2/G2BWPLBB4BHTPHELTU5L6E6BYE.jpg?auth=980843c6d8f8e41b0a8c305884988763321cbe2c444609c541801b067fdc7168&width=1200&height=675&quality=70&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

monopoly in search and online advertising.\n\n\"The court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" the ruling by judge Amit Mehta said.\n\nMehta found specifically that the company had maintained a monopoly in general search services and general search text advertising, although he rejected the US Department of Justice's claim that the company monopolised another specific area of the ads market.\n\nThe ruling paves the way for another trial around remedies, which is likely to prove lengthy.\n\nRemedy phase\n\nThe remedy phase could also be followed by appeals to the DC Circuit and US Supreme Courts, making it likely the case will continue into next year and possibly 2026.\n\nRemedies could involve prohibiting Google from paying partners to be the default search engine on computers and smartphones, a breakup of the firm's search business or other measures.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet said it plans to appeal the ruling.\n\n\"This landmark decision holds Google accountable,\" said Justice Department antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter in a statement.\n\n\"It paves the path for innovation for generations to come and protects access to information for all Americans.\"\n\nThe ruling is a significant win for US antitrust authorities, which have filed a series of lawsuits against the biggest tech companies over the past four years since the Google case began under the previous administration in 2020.\n\nMehta noted that Google paid $26.3 billion (\u00a320.5bn) in 2021 alone to ensure its search was the default on smartphones and browsers and to maintain its dominant share of roughly 90 percent for online search and 95 percent for smartphones.\n\nBig Tech suits\n\n\"Even if a new entrant were positioned from a quality standpoint to bid for the default when an agreement expires, such a firm could compete only if it were prepared to pay partners upwards of billions of dollars in revenue share and make them whole for any revenue shortfalls resulting from the change,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nHe said Google itself had estimated that losing the Safari default on Macs and iPhones would result in \"billions of dollars in lost revenues\".\n\nGoogle has argued it remains successful because of its high quality.\n\n\"Google is winning because it's better,\" said Google lawyer John Schmidtlein in closing statements earlier this year.\n\nThe trial lasted 10 weeks from September to November of last year and concluded with closing statements in May.\n\nOther antitrust lawsuits are pending against Meta Platforms, Amazon and Apple that claim the companies have illegally maintained monopolies.\n\nA separate case against Google over its advertising technology is scheduled for trial in September.\n\nRead also : UK Investigates Alphabet Partnership With AI Firm Anthropic", "source": {"uri": "silicon.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Silicon UK"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Continue to check back with us as we will be adding more information as it becomes available.\n\nWe know that Google pays Apple a lot of money to be the default search engine on Safari. The tech giant is clearly proud of its search engine market dominance, and plans to keep it that way. For reference, as of July 2024, Google boasted a 91.02 percent search engine market share worldwide, with Bing coming in at a distant second with a 3.88 percent market share, and Moscow-based Yandex coming in at third with 1.36 percent.\n\nBecause of its practices to maintain its dominance over the search engine market, the US Department of Justice views Google as a bully, and in a new landmark decision today, what were accusations then are rulings now.\n\nRelated Google pays Apple top dollar to be the default Safari search engine\n\nRoughly 16.75% of Apple's operating income in 2022 came from Google\n\nFederal court Judge Amit P. Mehta ruled today, Monday, August 5, that Google is indeed an illegal monopolist in the search engine market, adding that the tech giant maintains its dominance through anti-competitive practices.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" said Judge Amit P. Mehta.\n\nThe 277-page-long ruling also adds that Google's dominance has the power to influence the way users shop, consume information, and search online, considering that it basically controls the digital advertising market, though the ruling did not provide a remedy for the tech giant's actions. Remedies, which Judge Mehta will decide in a subsequent phase of the case, might include forcing Google to divest parts of its businesses or change the way it operates.\n\nKey findings from the ruling Related Google's landmark antitrust lawsuit explained\n\nThe company is under investigation for its default search engine deals\n\nThe court ruled that the tech giant uses illegal and anti-competitive practices to maintain its monopoly, like paying the likes of Apple and Samsung billions of dollars every year to maintain Google Search as their default search engine, leaving other search engines, like Microsoft's Bing, with no chance to compete.\n\nThe ruling also", "source": {"uri": "androidpolice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Android Police"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yandex", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yandex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/google-courtroom-lawsuit.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 1059, "textEnd": 1067}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

As U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta wrote in his 277-page ruling, \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\"\n\nThe judge found that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, illegally securing its dominance in the search market by paying billions of dollars to smartphone carriers like Apple and Samsung to make Google the automatic search engine for their phones.\n\nGet a dose of digital travel in your inbox each day\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter below\n\nSubmit\n\nI accept the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.\n\n\"This landmark decision holds Google accountable,\" Justice Department antitrust official Jonathan Kanter said in a statement. \"It paves the path for innovation for generations to come and protects access to information for all Americans.\"\n\nGoogle said it will appeal the ruling.\n\n\"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Kent Walker, Google's president for global affairs, said in a statement.\n\nThe ruling concerned only whether Google violated antitrust laws. The judge will decide what steps should be taken to address Google's monopoly in a separate proceeding. They could range from specific orders regarding the company's business practices or even a directive that Google sell of parts off its business.\n\nA separate federal trial is scheduled in September over allegations from the Justice Department that Google's advertising technology represents an illegal monopoly.\n\nWhile the full impact on travel companies won't be immediately clear, it could lead to lower advertising costs, said Brennan Bliss, CEO of digital travel marketing agency Propellic.\n\n\"Today's antitrust ruling against Google could significantly impact travel companies that depend on Google for bookings - mostly for the better,\" Bliss told PhocusWire in an email response, adding, \"We might see lower advertising costs and new opportunities on different platforms - Bing, DuckDuckGo, and more.\"\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department first brought the antitrust suit in 2020. The government argued that by paying billions of dollars to be the automatic search engine, Google denied competitors the chance to compete with its search engine. With the data Google collected from consumers, it made its search engine even better.\n\nIts dominance also allowed the company to raise advertising prices, practically at will, the judge found.\n\n\"The only apparent constraint on Google's pricing decisions are potential advertiser outcry and bad publicity,\" he wrote.\n\nTravel companies were making noise about Google's behavior before the suit was filed.\n\nIn May 2020, Expedia Group's then CEO Peter Kern said the company had been \"over-reliant\" on Google. Also that year, Tripadvisor's then-CEO Steve Kaufer complained that the company's earnings had suffered \"as Google continues to siphon off high-quality traffic that would otherwise have visited Tripadvisor.\"\n\nWith the filing of the suit that October, Viator founder Rod Cuthbert predicted trouble for Google.\n\n\"While up until now Google has been cavalier in placing its own offerings first in search results, thus abusing its monopoly power, sometime in the not too distant future it will start to ask itself how well such actions are perceived by the world at large, including the Justice Department and its end-users,\" Cuthbert said, adding, \"Once Google has to fight for users on even ground, it will lose its enthusiasm for competing with its advertising customers.\"\n\n*PhocusWire senior reporter Morgan Hines contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "phocuswire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "phocuswire.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "d_j_catron@phocuswire.com", "name": "D.J.

Mehta wrote in his judgment on Monday.\n\n\"The ruling affirms our allegations that Google's market dominance and anticompetitive practices have stifled competition and harmed both businesses and consumers in New Hampshire and across the country by inflating prices and restricting market choices.\"\n\nMehta wrote that Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act by maintaining its monopoly in two product markets in the United States -- general search service and general text advertising -- through exclusive distribution agreements with customer companies.\n\nThe case has been closely watched in antitrust law circles as the first of a string of cases federal prosecutors have launched against high-tech giants. Antitrust enforcers argue that Big Tech has gotten too powerful and doesn't serve the public interest. Lawsuits have also been filed against Amazon, Meta and Apple.\n\nThe Justice Department asserted that Google violated federal antitrust law by forging contracts that require Google to be installed as the default search engine on Android smartphones, among other practices that prevented its rivals from competing on an even playing field.\n\nGoogle argued that users were free to switch their default search engine, and that it is easy to do so.\n\nThe Justice Department and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.\n\nThe case, U.S. et al v. Google, was filed in 2020 under the Trump administration, and prosecutors in the Biden administration's Justice Department took it to court in September 2023.\n\nThe nine-week trial in Washington saw appearances by senior industry executives, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Apple executives John Giannandrea and Eduardo Cue, to testify about why other major tech companies have struggled to launch competitive rivals to Google search.\n\nThe trial and Mehta's ruling concerned only the question of whether Google violated antitrust laws. A separate proceeding will determine what remedies should be applied to increase competition in the search market.\n\nA separate Justice Department antitrust lawsuit against Google, focused on its advertising technology, is awaiting trial in federal court in Virginia.\n\nGoogle is also facing antitrust scrutiny in other jurisdictions, including in the European Union, where antitrust regulators announced in March investigations into the company and others under the new Digital Markets Act, a new anti-monopoly law aimed at internet giants.", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType":

The tech giant controls approximately 90% of the online search market and 95% of smartphones.\n\nA US District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C. has ruled that Google violated antitrust laws by creating an illegal monopoly in the search engine market. This ruling marks a significant victory for government regulators in their efforts to curb the dominance of Big Tech companies, on August 6, as per Reuters.\n\nMehta declared, \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\" The tech giant controls approximately 90% of the online search market and 95% of smartphones.\n\nThe case, initially filed during the Trump administration, focused on Google's practice of spending billions annually to secure its position as the default search engine on various devices and platforms. Judge Mehta noted that in 2021 alone, Google spent $26.3 billion on such agreements.\n\n\"The default is extremely valuable real estate,\" Mehta wrote, highlighting the difficulty for potential competitors to enter the market. He added, \"Google, of course, recognizes that losing defaults would dramatically impact its bottom line.\"\n\nThis ruling paves the way for a second trial to determine appropriate remedies, potentially including breaking up Google's parent company, Alphabet. Such an outcome would significantly alter the landscape of online advertising, where Google has long been a dominant player.\n\nUS Attorney General Merrick Garland hailed the decision as \"a historic win for the American people,\" emphasising that \"no company - no matter how large or influential - is above the law.\"\n\nGoogle, however, plans to appeal the ruling. The company stated, \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available.\"\n\nThe legal process is expected to be lengthy, with potential appeals reaching the US Court of Appeals and possibly the Supreme Court.

Through this trial, it was revealed that Google paid Apple $20 billion to be the default search engine in 2022. The case also saw testimony from several Apple executives, including services boss Eddy Cue and machine learning executive John Giannandrea.\n\nToday's ruling from Judge Mehta explicitly calls out Google's agreements with Apple and other companies as anti-competitive.

In the balance, there are more antitrust cases in the tech sector involving Meta and Amazon, among others.\n\nWith that in mind it's important to focus on the details in the judge's decision, which concludes that Google's business practices violated antitrust laws, specifically the Sherman Act, by maintaining and abusing its monopoly power in the search and search advertising markets.\n\nAccording to several legal opinions in the immediate aftermath of the decision, consumers will not be affected any time soon. However, before the decision, several legal firms played \"what if\" with the anticipated decision, including this speculation from the Lanier Law Firm -- which had filed one of the many suits against Google -- in January.\n\n\"Casual web and smartphone users, for example, will see a wider variety of search engines available for use if Google loses in these antitrust lawsuits. Instead of being directed to Google by default, many more users will search the internet using privacy-focused search engines such as DuckDuckGo,\" the firm posted.\n\n\"When booking travel, looking for hotels, or searching for activities on your next vacation, Google's loss in these antitrust cases would place vertical search websites higher in the search results. Instead of seeing services such as Google Flights or Google Hotels above the fold, you'll begin to see more companies like Tripadvisor, Yelp or Kayak.\"\n\nThe case, formally known as United States of America et al. v. Google LLC, centered on Google's extensive and complex business practices that, according to the plaintiffs, stifled competition and innovation. The ruling, detailed in a comprehensive 286-page opinion by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, outlines how Google's practices created barriers to entry for competitors, thereby maintaining what he called its monopolistic status.\n\nThe decision marks a turning point in a nearly four-year legal battle between Google and U.S. antitrust enforcers. The Department of Justice, joined by 11 states, filed the original lawsuit in October 2020, alleging that Google used anticompetitive tactics to preserve its dominance in search and search advertising. A separate lawsuit filed by a coalition of state attorneys general was later consolidated with the federal case.\n\nAfter a nine-week bench trial that concluded in November 2023, Mehta ruled that Google's distribution agreements with mobile device manufacturers, wireless carriers and web browser developers foreclosed rivals from key distribution channels and allowed Google to unlawfully maintain its monopoly power.\n\nThe court defined two relevant antitrust markets in which Google was found to have monopoly power:\n\n1. General search services: Mehta rejected Google's argument for a broader \"query responses\" market that would have included specialized vertical providers like Amazon. Instead, he concluded that general search engines like Google and Bing constitute a distinct product market.\n\n2. General search text advertising: The court found that text ads on general search engines are a separate market from other forms of online advertising, including product listing ads and display ads.\n\nIn both markets, the court determined that Google possesses monopoly power based on its dominant market share and the existence of significant barriers to entry. The ruling notes that Google has held over 80% share of general search queries since 2009, reaching nearly 90% by 2020. In general search text advertising, Google's market share was found to be 88%.\n\nAt the core of the case were Google's revenue-sharing agreements that make Google the preset default search engine on Apple's Safari browser, Mozilla's Firefox browser and on Android mobile devices. Mehta concluded these agreements are exclusive deals that hinder rivals from critical distribution channels.\n\nThe court found the agreements produce three main anticompetitive effects:\n\n1. Market foreclosure: The agreements were found to foreclose about 50% of general search queries and 45% of the general search text ad market from competitors.\n\n2. Depriving rivals of scale: By locking up default search placements, the agreements deny Google's competitors access to search queries and user data needed to improve their products and ad platforms.\n\n3. Reduced incentives to invest and innovate: The ruling states that Google's exclusive grip on key distribution channels has diminished incentives for both Google and its rivals to invest in search and search advertising capabilities.\n\nMehta rejected Google's arguments that the agreements produce offsetting procompetitive benefits. He found that Google failed to show that deals enhance user experience, incentivize competition, or produce other benefits that justify their exclusionary effects.\n\nNotably, the court dismissed Google's contention that it faces robust competition for queries from specialized vertical providers and social media platforms. Mehta determined these are largely complementary services rather than substitutes for general search.\n\nA key finding in the ruling is that Google's monopoly power has enabled it to charge supracompetitive prices for search text ads without facing meaningful competitive constraints. The court cited evidence that Google has used various \"pricing knobs\" to steadily increase text ad prices over time, often seeing about 50% of price hikes stick long-term.\n\nMehta found Google makes these pricing decisions without regard for competitors' pricing. He stated this ability to profitably raise prices substantially above competitive levels is clear evidence of monopoly power.\n\nWhile finding Google liable for monopolization, the ruling does not specify remedies at this stage. Mehta indicated the court will address relief in subsequent proceedings.\n\nThe Department of Justice had previously suggested potential remedies could include barring Google from entering into exclusionary agreements, unwinding existing deals, and potentially requiring divestitures. However, the exact scope of relief remains to be determined.\n\nA few other notable elements of Mehta's decision:\n\n* The court rejected a proposed market for \"general search advertising\" that would have included both text ads and product listing ads. It found insufficient evidence to support this as a relevant antitrust market.\n\n* Mehta dismissed claims related to Google's search advertising tool SA360, finding Google had no duty to provide feature parity between its own ad platform and Microsoft's.\n\n* The ruling declined to impose sanctions on Google for failing to preserve certain employee chat messages, though it criticized the company's practices around document retention.\n\n* While focused on competitive effects rather than intent, the judge expressed concern over \"the lengths to which Google goes to avoid creating a paper trail for regulators and litigants.\"", "source": {"uri": "pymnts.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PYMNTS.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Search advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Flights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google Flights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sherman Antitrust Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDuckGo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DuckDuckGo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barriers_to_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barriers to entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreclosure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreclosure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yelp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yelp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firefox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Google-antitrust.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-10-", "textStart": 2149, "textEnd": 2161}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

The verdict, delivered by Judge Amit Mehta, marks a significant legal victory for the Department of Justice (DOJ), which has continuously charged Google with using anti-competitive tactics to maintain its market dominance.\n\nJudge Mehta's assessment concluded that Google has intentionally maintained its monopoly in \"general search services\" and \"general search text advertising.\" The court's judgment indicates that Google's actions breach Section 2 of the Sherman Act, a primary antitrust law. Nonetheless, not all of the government's claims were supported; particularly, the court dismissed the assertion of Google's monopoly power in a specific segment of the advertising market.\n\nThe ruling determines Google's liability but does not specify remedies. These will be decided in subsequent legal proceedings. Potential outcomes may include required changes to Google's business practices or possibly a breakup of its search operations. Google has stated it plans to appeal the ruling. Kent Walker, President of Global Affairs at Google, acknowledged the decision but contended that it penalizes the company for providing a superior service.\n\nDOJ's antitrust chief, Jonathan Kanter, hailed the decision as a significant step towards fostering innovation and safeguarding access to information. Competing search engine DuckDuckGo also welcomed the ruling but stressed that the battle against Google's practices continues. The court refuted Google's claims that its contracts with phone and browser makers, like Apple, were non-exclusionary. Judge Mehta noted that substantial revenue intake from Google discourages Apple from creating its own search engine.\n\nJudge Mehta drew comparisons with the US v. Microsoft case, emphasizing that such conduct can be exclusionary when executed by a dominant firm like Google. He pointed out Google's enduring monopoly, highlighting an increase in market share from 80% in 2009 to 90% by 2020, while Bing's share remained under 6%. The judge stressed that even major US companies lack viable alternatives to Google, with changing default search engines leading to considerable financial losses.\n\nIn the search text advertising market, Judge Mehta identified that Google's exclusive agreements enabled it to raise prices without facing genuine competition. Google claimed its ad prices, when adjusted for quality, have decreased over time, but Mehta found this evidence unconvincing, suggesting Google's primary goal is long-term revenue.\n\nThis ruling is part of a broader antitrust lawsuit led by the DOJ, accusing Google of anti-competitive behavior to uphold its market superiority. The case is ongoing, with potential implications for Google's business practices and the regulatory framework surrounding digital markets.\n\nThe decision for the wider DoJ investigation was made last September and could have a huge impact on Google and its parent Alphabet. Last year, the DoJ accused the company of destroying evidence by deleting chats between employees. In November 2022, Google agreed to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to 40 states in the biggest anti-trust settlement in U.S. law.\n\nGoogle argued that the failure of rivals such as Microsoft Bing was not down to its own practices but rather the failures of Microsoft. The trial also looked into Google's search ad practices. As we reported in September, the DOJ alleges that Google's market dominance allows it to hike ad prices without significant consequences. This claim is substantiated by Jerry Dischler, a Google ads executive, who testified about the company's ad pricing strategies.\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella have both given testimonies during the landmark trial. In his testimonies to the court, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella suggested Google stifles Bing. Nadella revealed that Microsoft has poured a staggering $100 billion into Bing, its proprietary search engine. Nadella candidly admitted Microsoft's unsuccessful attempts to dethrone Google from this position, even after offering Apple more favorable terms.\n\nGoogle reportedly pays Apple up to $20 billion per year to keep its Search engine on iPhone and other devices. However, Pichai claims this drives competition not blocks it. He reasoned that the cost-effectiveness of contending with a potential Apple-powered rival search engine or another competitor weighed in favor of retaining Google's default status on iPhones.", "source": {"uri": "winbuzzer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WinBuzzer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "luke_jones@winbuzzer.com", "name": "Luke Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sherman Antitrust Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Kanter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Kanter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDuckGo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DuckDuckGo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sundar Pichai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://winbuzzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-campus-building-creative-commons-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Google controls about 90% of the online search market and 95% on smartphones.\n\nThe \"remedy\" phase could be lengthy, followed by potential appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court. The legal wrangling could play out into next year, or even 2026.\n\nShares of Alphabet fell 4.5% on Monday amid a broad decline in tech shares as the wider stock market cratered on recession fears. Google advertising was 77% of Alphabet's total sales in 2023.\n\nAlphabet said it plans to appeal Mehta's ruling. \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Google said in a statement.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland called the ruling \"a historic win for the American people,\" adding that \"no company - no matter how large or influential - is above the law.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the \"pro-competition ruling is a victory for the American people,\" adding that \"Americans deserve an internet that is free, fair, and open for competition.\"\n\nBILLIONS PAID\n\nMehta noted that Google had paid $26.3 billion in 2021 alone to ensure that its search engine is the default on smartphones and browsers, and to keep its dominant market share.\n\n\"The default is extremely valuable real estate,\" Mehta wrote. \"Even if a new entrant were positioned from a quality standpoint to bid for the default when an agreement expires, such a firm could compete only if it were prepared to pay partners upwards of billions of dollars in revenue share and make them whole for any revenue shortfalls resulting from the change.\"\n\nHe added, \"Google, of course, recognizes that losing defaults would dramatically impact its bottom line. For instance, Google has projected that losing the Safari default would result in a significant drop in queries and billions of dollars in lost revenues.\"\n\nThe ruling is the first major decision in a series of cases taking on alleged monopolies in Big Tech. This case, filed by the Trump administration, went before a judge from September to November of last year.\n\n\"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, who said a drawn-out legal process would delay any immediate effects for consumers.\n\nIn the past four years, federal antitrust regulators have also sued Meta Platforms, Amazon.com and Apple, claiming the companies have illegally maintained monopolies.\n\nThose cases all began under the administration of former President Donald Trump.\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, said the fact that the case spanned administrations shows strong bipartisan support for antitrust enforcement.\n\n\"It's a huge victory for the American people that antitrust enforcement is alive and well when it comes to competition,\" she said. \"Google is a rampant monopolist.\"\n\nWhen it was filed in 2020, the Google search case was the first time in a generation that the U.S. government accused a major corporation of an illegal monopoly. Microsoft settled with the Justice Department in 2004 over claims that it forced its Internet Explorer Web browser on Windows users.\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson and Mike Scarcella in Washington

The company maintains that its success is a result of superior product innovation and consumer preference.\n\nReaction to the ruling against Google\n\n\"People are increasingly looking for information in more and more ways,\" said Kent Walker, Google's global affairs president.\n\n\"This decision recognises that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" he said. \"As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use.\"\n\nAttorney general Merrick Garland described the victory against Google \"a historic win for the American people.\"\n\n\"No company - no matter how large or influential - is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws,\" he said.\n\nAssistant attorney general Jonathan Kanter stated: \"This landmark decision holds Google accountable. It paves the path for innovation for generations to come and protects access to information for all Americans.\n\n\"This victory is a reflection on the tireless efforts of the dedicated public servants at the Antitrust Division and our state law enforcement partners whose work made today's decision possible.\"\n\nWhile the ruling is a setback for Google, the legal battle is far from over. The appeals process could take years, and it remains unclear what remedies the court will ultimately impose. Potential options include hefty fines or behavioural remedies.\n\nThe government has requested \"structural relief,\" which could potentially lead to the company being broken up.\n\nImplications of the ruling against Google\n\nThe implications of the ruling extend beyond Google. It signals a potential shift in the government's approach to regulating Big Tech companies, with similar antitrust cases pending against Meta, Amazon and Apple.\n\nIn March, the DOJ accused Apple of monopolising the US smartphone market and driving up prices.\n\nAttorney general Garland said Apple had violated section two of the Sherman Antitrust Act, forcing higher prices and fees for \"lower quality smartphones\" and apps, and privileging its own apps against third-party apps by selectively restricting access to iOS operating system features.\n\nIn June, a UK tribunal ruled that Google must face a \u00a313.6 billion lawsuit that alleges tech giant wields undue power over the online advertising market.\n\nRipples from the ruling will be felt outside of Google, including at Apple, which received $20 billion per year for making Google the default on its devices, and Firefox-maker Mozilla.\n\nIn 2021-2022 financial statement $510 million out of the Mozilla Foundation's $593

Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nGoogle almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may land in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of not having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nAs expected, Mehta's ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than $26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default settings. He noted that Microsoft's Bing search engine has 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in as the predetermined default option.\n\n\"Advertisers consistently testified that shifting significant ad spending from Google to Bing would be ineffective (and unwise) because of Bing's lack of scale,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nStill, Mehta credited the quality of Google's product as an important part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that \"Google is widely recognized as the best (general search engine) available in the United States.\"\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\n\"The court confirmed what almost everyone in the industry already knew: that Google is a monopoly and is abusing its power to harm consumers and enrich itself,\" said Roger Alford, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out billions annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said eMarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google. Its ubiquity is its biggest strength, especially as competition heats up among AI-powered search alternatives.\"\n\nRegardless she added, a drawn-out appeals process will delay any immediate effects for both consumers and advertisers.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nGoogle faces several other legal threats both in the U.S. and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.\n\nKids, screen time and

The search engine giant controls about 90 per cent of the online search market, and 95 per cent on smartphones.\n\nThe \"remedy\" phase could be lengthy, followed by potential appeals to the D.C.

Even if a new entrant were positioned from a quality standpoint to bid for the default when an agreement expires, such a firm could compete only if it were prepared to pay partners upwards of billions of dollars in revenue share and make them whole for any revenue shortfalls resulting from the change,\" the judge wrote.\n\nHe noted \"Google, of course, recognises that losing defaults would dramatically impact its bottom line. For instance, Google has projected that losing the Safari default would result in a significant drop in queries and billions of dollars in lost revenues\".\n\nThe ruling is the first major decision in a series of cases taking on alleged monopolies in Big Tech. This case, filed by the Trump administration, went before a judge from September to November.\n\n\"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, who noted a drawn out legal process will delay any immediate effects for consumers.\n\nIn the past four years, federal antitrust regulators have also sued Meta Platforms, Amazon.com, and Apple, claiming the companies have illegally maintained monopolies. Those cases all began under the administration of former President Donald Trump.\n\nMs Amy Klobuchar, a Democratic US senator who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, said the fact that the case spanned administrations shows strong bipartisan support for antitrust enforcement.\n\n\"It's a huge victory for the American people that antitrust enforcement is alive and well when it comes to competition,\" she said. \"Google is a rampant monopolist.\"\n\nWhen it was filed in 2020, the Google search case was the first time in a generation that the US government accused a major corporation of an illegal monopoly. Microsoft settled with the Justice Department in 2004 over claims that it forced its Internet Explorer web browser on Windows users.

It may not display this or other websites correctly.\n\nYou should upgrade or use an alternative browser.\n\nThe paid agreement that Google has with Apple to be the default search engine on the iPhone and other Apple devices violates antitrust law, a federal judge ruled today (via Bloomberg).\n\nGoogle has long paid Apple billions of dollars a year to be the default Safari search engine, and this relationship has been under scrutiny as Google battles antitrust allegations made by the United States Justice Department. The court today found in favor of the DoJ, and said that Google is indeed shutting out competition by paying smartphone makers for default status.\n\nGoogle's agreements with Apple and other smartphone makers have a \"significant effect\" maintaining Google's search monopoly, keeping other search engines from competing and reinforcing Google's dominant position. Google has a search market share of around 95 percent on smartphones, in part due to the money that it pays.\n\nIn 2022, Google paid Apple $20 billion, an amount that incentivizes Apple to stick with the status quo. Apple does not provide opportunities to other search engines, nor does it develop its own search product due to the money that it receives from Google, according to the DoJ.\n\nAfter considering testimony from Apple, Google, Microsoft, and other companies, the court decided that Google has a search monopoly. \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly. It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act,\" reads the ruling.\n\nThe court will need to decide on the next actions to take to address Google's anticompetitive practices, and injunctions could be forthcoming.\n\nGoogle and Apple could in the future be barred from entering into search agreements, which will result in a revenue loss for both companies. Apple will not get billions for promoting Google Search, and Google will lose out on being the default option across billions of Apple devices.\n\nGoogle is likely to appeal the decision.\n\nArticle Link: Google and Apple's Search Engine Deal Violates Antitrust Law", "source": {"uri": "forums.macrumors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MacRumors Forums"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sherman Antitrust Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/Google-Logo-Feature-Slack.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

District judge, found Google guilty of violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act, concluding that the company unlawfully solidified its dominance in the search market by paying substantial amounts to smartphone carriers like Apple to establish Google as the default search engine on their devices, effectively preventing any competing businesses from entering the market.\n\nIn his ruling, Mehta stated, \"Google is a monopolist and has behaved as such to preserve its monopoly.\"\n\nFollowing a 10-week trial in Washington, D.C. last year, where Justice Department officials and dozens of state attorneys general aimed to expose Google's anti-competitive strategies that led to its dominance as the top search engine globally.\n\nAlthough Mehta's ruling does not specify any particular remedies, he will need to determine appropriate actions to address Google's monopoly, which experts suggest could involve specific directives to the company to rectify its business practices or potentially divest parts of the corporation.\n\nIn a statement, Google opted to highlight the positive remarks made by the judge in the ruling.\n\nKent Walker, Google's president for global affairs, remarked, \"This ruling acknowledges that Google provides the top search engine but argues that we should not be permitted to make it readily accessible. We are grateful for the Court's recognition that Google is 'the industry's highest quality search engine, which has earned Google the trust of hundreds of millions of daily users', that Google 'has long been the best search engine, particularly on mobile devices', 'has continued to innovate in search' and that 'Apple and Mozilla occasionally evaluate Google's search quality compared to its competitors and find Google's to be superior.'\n\nHe further stated that the company will appeal the ruling, stating, \"Given this, and that people are increasingly seeking information in various ways, we intend to appeal. As this process unfolds, we will concentrate on creating products that people find useful and easy to use.\"\n\nThe Justice Department celebrated the groundbreaking ruling, with Attorney General Merrick Garland declaring in a statement, \"This triumph against Google is a historic victory for the American people. No corporation, regardless of its size or influence, is exempt from the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously uphold our antitrust laws.\"\n\nAssistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter added in a statement, \"This significant ruling holds Google responsible. It opens the door to innovation for future generations and safeguards access to information for all Americans. This victory is a testament to the relentless efforts of the dedicated public servants at the Antitrust Division and our state law enforcement partners who made today's ruling possible.\"", "source": {"uri": "pehalnews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pehal News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sherman Antitrust Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Kanter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Kanter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Assistant_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Assistant Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice_Antitrust_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mozilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.pehalnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Judge-finds-Google-guilty-of-antitrust-violations-in-effort-to.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Could this lead to a Google breakup?", "body": "Image depicting Google as a powerful monopoly, with a giant Google logo overshadowing a cityscape of struggling businesses. Source: GuerillaStockTrading.com\n\nA federal judge ruled that Google violated US antitrust law by maintaining a monopoly in the search and advertising markets. Judge Amit Mehta concluded that Google is a monopolist and has acted to maintain this monopoly, violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act. This ruling is a significant victory for the Department of Justice, although Mehta did not agree with all their arguments. He confirmed that Google monopolizes \"general search services\" and \"general search text advertising,\" but not a specific part of the ads market. The ruling focuses on Google's liability, with future proceedings to determine possible remedies, which could range from mandated business practice changes to a breakup of Google's search business.\n\nMehta dismissed Google's argument that its contracts with phone and browser makers were non-exclusionary. He stated that Google's monopoly in general search has been consistent and durable, growing from 80% in 2009 to 90% in 2020. The judge emphasized that major companies have no viable alternative to Google for general search services. Google's exclusive agreements have allowed it to raise prices on search text advertising without competitive constraints. Mehta also addressed Google's failure to preserve relevant chat messages but did not impose sanctions.\n\nCourt's Ruling and Its Implications\n\nJudge Mehta's ruling states unequivocally, \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\" The court found that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act, a crucial piece of antitrust legislation. This decision is a pivotal moment in the ongoing battle against monopolistic practices in the tech industry.\n\nWhile the ruling is a major victory for the DOJ, Judge Mehta did not agree with all of the government's arguments. Notably, he rejected the claim that Google holds monopoly power in a specific segment of the advertising market. However, he concurred with the assertion that Google has a monopoly in \"general search services\" and \"general search text advertising.\"\n\nPotential Consequences for Google\n\nThe ruling's immediate impact on Google's business is still unclear. The next phase of proceedings will determine the consequences, which could range from mandated changes in business practices to a potential breakup of Google's search business. This phase will be crucial in shaping the future landscape of the online search and advertising markets.\n\nGoogle's Defense and the Court's Rejection\n\nGoogle argued that its contracts with phone and browser makers like Apple were not exclusionary and should not qualify it for liability under the Sherman Act. However, Judge Mehta dismissed this argument, stating that the substantial revenue Apple receives from Google disincentivizes it from launching its own search engine. \"The prospect of losing tens of billions in guaranteed revenue from Google -- which presently comes at little to no cost to Apple -- disincentivizes Apple from launching its own search engine when it otherwise has built the capacity to do so,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nThe court also referenced the framework from the landmark tech monopoly case, US v. Microsoft, highlighting its relevance to the current case against Google. Despite Google's claim that its actions remained consistent before and after achieving market dominance, Judge Mehta emphasized that such conduct can be exclusionary when performed by a dominant player, even if it is not when done by a smaller entity.\n\nGoogle's Durable Monopoly\n\nJudge Mehta described Google's monopoly in general search as \"remarkably durable,\" noting that its market share increased from about 80 percent in 2009 to 90 percent by 2020. In comparison, Bing holds less than 6 percent of the market share. \"If there is genuine competition in the market for general search, it has not manifested in familiar ways, such as fluid market shares, lost business, or new entrants,\" Mehta stated.\n\nThe ruling underscores the lack of viable alternatives to Google for general search engines. Judge Mehta cited a quote from Apple SVP Eddy Cue, who testified that there was \"no price that Microsoft could ever offer [Apple] to preload Bing.\" This sentiment reflects the broader market reality that even the largest businesses in the US have no real alternative to Google.\n\nSearch Text Advertising and Pricing Practices\n\nRegarding search text advertising, Judge Mehta found that Google's exclusive agreements allowed it to raise prices without meaningful competitive constraints. Although Google argued that the price of its search text ads, when adjusted for quality, has decreased, Mehta found this evidence weak. He noted that Google itself recognized the difficulty in determining \"the value of an ad to its buyer.\" The judge concluded that Google's pricing practices were primarily aimed at driving long-term revenues rather than reflecting principled, quality-adjusted pricing.\n\nNo Sanctions for Destroying Evidence\n\nJudge Mehta declined to impose sanctions on Google for failing to preserve chat messages relevant to the case, despite the DOJ's characterization of this as evidence destruction. While he acknowledged Google's failure to preserve chat evidence, he determined that the requested sanctions did not affect the court's assessment of Google's liability. However, Mehta cautioned that Google's avoidance of sanctions in this case does not guarantee similar leniency in future cases.\n\nFuture Remedies: The judgment currently addresses Google's liability, with future proceedings to decide on possible remedies, including business practice changes or a breakup of its search operations.\n\nMonopoly Maintenance: Google has maintained its monopoly in search and advertising markets through exclusionary contracts and dominant market practices.\n\nLegal Findings: Judge Mehta found Google guilty of violating the Sherman Act, specifically Section 2, by monopolizing general search services and search text advertising.\n\nImpact on Market: The ruling highlights the lack of genuine competition in the search market, with Google's dominance being unchallenged by competitors like Bing.\n\nThe price is currently at $160.10, down -6.56 for the day.

While two decades passed between the DOJ's antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft and its next tech anti-monopoly case against Google, filed in 2020, several more such cases have followed swiftly. This ruling sets a significant precedent and signals a renewed commitment by the US government to challenge monopolistic practices in the tech industry.\n\nIn conclusion, Judge Mehta's ruling against Google represents a critical juncture in the ongoing efforts to regulate and ensure fair competition in the tech sector. The next phase of proceedings will be pivotal in determining the full extent of the ruling's impact on Google's business and the broader market dynamics.", "source": {"uri": "guerillastocktrading.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guerilla Stock Trading"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lance_jepsen@guerillastocktrading.com", "name": "Lance Jepsen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sherman Antitrust Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Master of Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_strength_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relative strength index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technical analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MACD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MACD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_Cue", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eddy Cue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moving average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Histogram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Internet_Marketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Internet Marketing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://www.guerillastocktrading.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-depicting-Google-as-a-powerful-monopoly-guerillastocktrading.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The revelation shocked Apple's fans, who were told that \"everything that happens on iPhone stays on iPhone.\" But with this guilty verdict, it's going to be further damaging to both companies. It could also harm Mozilla, which relies on Google search engine payments to stay in business.\n\n\"Google has thwarted true competition by foreclosing its rivals from the most effective channels of search distribution,\" Judge Mehta writes in the ruling, comparing the company and its behavior to Microsoft, which used similar tactics in the late 1990s to harm Netscape. \"Google's distribution agreements are exclusionary contracts that violate Section 2 [of the Sherman Act] because they ensure that half of all [online search] users in the United States will receive Google as the preloaded default on all Apple and Android devices, as well as cause additional anticompetitive harm. The agreements 'clearly have a significant effect in preserving [Google's] monopoly'.\"\n\nWhat Google is doing with its search agreements-with Apple, Mozilla, and others-is paying for placement at such a high price that it prevents potential competitors from even trying. This is the \"barrier to entry\" argument common to antitrust, as it skews what would otherwise be a healthy competitive environment by skewing the choices in its favor. The ruling notes that Google spent over $26 billion on traffic acquisition costs in 2021 alone, four times the cost of all of Google's other search-related costs, including R&D, combined.\n\nThis is bad enough for web browser makers, but it's incredible for Apple and the iPhone: At $20 billion per year or more, Google is probably contributing over 25 percent of Apple's total Services revenues and at no cost to Apple. The ruling notes Apple executive Eddy Cue's testimony explaining that Microsoft literally couldn't pay enough to get Apple to switch from Google to Bing: Google Search was superior because Google could improve its results using the massive amount of data it got from Apple's users. Or, as Judge Mehta put it, \"Google's distribution agreements have constrained the query volumes of its rivals, thereby inoculating Google against any genuine competitive threat.\"\n\n\"No profit-driven firm in Microsoft's position would invest the substantial sums required to enhance its search product when there is little to no genuine opportunity for a default distribution deal,\" the ruling continues. \"Google's distribution agreements thus appear reasonably capable of having significantly contributed to disincentivizing Microsoft from enlarging its investment in search.\"\n\nThe ruling verifies that Google paid Apple $20 billion in 2022, 17.5 percent of Apple's annual profits, so its payment last year would have been higher. And that Apple was financially disincentivized from creating its own search engine, as Google's huge annual payments were all profit, with no risk or expenses.\n\nGoogle did win on some minor points, and Judge Mehta declined to sanction the company. But because Google was found to have violated U.S. antitrust laws, it must terminate its exclusive distribution agreements, subject to a separate penalties phase and an expected appeal. If this ruling is upheld, Google, Apple, and Mozilla could all suffer greatly. Microsoft could find that its fruitless investments in Bing will suddenly pay off in a regulated market for search. And in an extreme outcome, Google might even face a breakup order, which the DOJ indicated was a possibility.\n\nMore soon: I need some time to analyze this ruling.

Google had a long-standing practice of deleting employees' chat messages after 24 hours unless a setting was changed to preserve them. The court documents stated that even two years after filing suit, Google still was not preserving chat messages of its employees that were under a legal hold.

Now, of course, we all know Google is the largest search engine. It's not a crime to have the most popular product that everyone uses. However, the big deal here is that a judge is saying the way Google conducts its business is actually breaking the law because it is illegal to act in a way that harms competition. And this in part has to do with how Google pays companies like Apple and Samsung to make Google the default search engine on phones. In his decision. US district judge me wrote quote after having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion, Google is a monopolist and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly. Google responded with a statement from Kent Walker, the company's president for Global Affairs who said the company does plan to appeal and Walker said, quote, this decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available. Now, the justice department also put out its own statement on the ruling in the trial. The justice department pointed to how Google paid Apple and Samsung billions of dollars to make sure that Google was the default search engine on smartphones and phone browsers, which then Google gets all this user data to grow stronger and stronger. And the argument is that it makes it hard for other search engines to compete. The New York Times reported, Google paid Apple about $18 billion in 2021 to be the default search engine on iphones. And this is just about the search engine. The government also accused Google of running an illegal monopoly over the advertisements in its search results. This whole ordeal has been stretched out. The lawsuit was filed in 2020. The trial was last year and it took 10 weeks and now the judge ruled that Google violated the law. So what's next? Well, there's going to be another ruling perhaps coming on what the punishment or cure will need to be. The court might say what Google needs to change to fix this illegal monopoly behavior. It's been quite an error for the government going after big tech giants and their monopolies. Earlier this year, the justice department sued Apple over how it makes it hard for iphone customers to leave the iphone and switch to Android. That battle is still ongoing. Last year, the FTC sued Amazon alleging that it blocks competition and the FTC also has an ongoing lawsuit with Meta over how it accumulated a social media monopoly when it acquired Instagram and whatsapp and the agency is trying to break up the company. The last time government really changed things by breaking up. Big tech was back in the nineties when Microsoft was found to have an illegal monopoly for how internet explorer was the dominant browser on Windows machines. Now that ended up stretching out for years and going to the US court of appeals for the district of Columbia where the US government and soft reached a settlement and Microsoft agreed to make some changes. Now, in this Google case, you can expect it to be drawn out with appeals taking a while. And one former chairman of the FTC told the New York Times that this could even head to the Supreme Court.

What that remedy could look like isn't yet clear.\n\nThe government has pushed for \"structural relief\" - which could possibly mean the breakup of the company. If that is the route the government pushes for, it could end up being the biggest forced breakup of a US company since AT&T was dismantled in 1984.\n\nThe ruling comes as a wake-up call to other Big Tech companies. Federal antitrust regulators have filed other pending lawsuits against Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook, Amazon and Apple accusing them of operating unlawful monopolies.\n\nIn a reaction to this week's ruling against Google, US Attorney General Merrick Garland said, \"This victory against Google is a historic win for the American people. No company - no matter how large or influential - is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce the antitrust laws.\"\n\nGoogle, expectedly, positioned the latest ruling differently. \"This decision recognises that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" it said in a statement.\n\nWhat pans out next for Google will be keenly watched in Australia too. Recently, as ChannelNews reported, following an intervention by Australia's top consumer protection regulator, two major telecom companies - Telstra and Optus - agreed that they will no longer have exclusive agreements with Google Search to have the service pre-installed as the default search engine on Android devices that they sell.\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) became aware of agreements that Google initiated and entered into with Telstra and Optus that limited the ability for rival search engines to be pre-installed and promoted on Android devices, in return for a share of Google's advertising revenue.\n\nGoogle's agreements with Telstra and Optus were in place since at least 2017, and expired on June 20, 2024. The two telcos agreed not to renew or enter any new arrangements with Google that require its search services to be pre-installed and set as the default search function on an exclusive basis on the devices they supply.", "source": {"uri": "channelnews.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "ChannelNews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_richards@channelnews.com.au", "name": "David Richards", "type":

Mehta wrote in his judgment on Monday.\n\nMehta wrote that Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act by maintaining its monopoly in two product markets in the United States - general search service and text advertising - through exclusive distribution agreements with customer companies.\n\nThe case has been closely watched in antitrust law circles as the first of a string of cases federal prosecutors have launched against high-tech giants. Antitrust enforcers argue that Big Tech has gotten too powerful and doesn't serve the public interest. Lawsuits have also been filed against Amazon, Meta and Apple.\n\nThe Justice Department asserted that Google violated federal antitrust law by forging contracts that require Google to be installed as the default search engine on Android smartphones, among other practices that prevented its rivals from competing on an even playing field.\n\nGoogle argued that users were free to switch their default search engine, and that it is easy to do so.\n\nThe Justice Department and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.\n\nThe case, U.S. et al v. Google, was filed in 2020 under the Trump administration, and prosecutors in the Biden administration's Justice Department took it to court in September 2023.\n\nThe nine-week trial at the E. Barrett Prettyman Courthouse in Washington saw appearances by senior industry executives, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Apple executives John Giannandrea and Eduardo Cue, to testify about why other major tech companies have struggled to launch competitive rivals to Google search.\n\nThe trial and Mehta's ruling concerned only the question of whether Google violated antitrust laws. A separate proceeding will determine what remedies should be applied to increase competition in the search market.\n\nA separate Justice Department antitrust lawsuit against Google, focused on its advertising technology, is awaiting trial in federal court in Virginia.\n\nGoogle is also facing antitrust scrutiny in other jurisdictions, including in the European Union, where antitrust regulators announced in March investigations into the company and others under the new Digital Markets Act, a new anti-monopoly law aimed at internet giants.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType":

Mehta held that Google LLC violated section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act by maintaining an illegal monopoly over internet search and search advertising markets on Monday.\n\nThe ruling marks a significant victory for the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and State Attorneys General who have been challenging Google's dominance for several years, with Mehta also concluding that Google engaged in unlawful practices to preserve its monopoly in the online search sector.\n\nSection 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act prohibits monopolization or attempts to monopolize and targets unfair practices to achieve monopoly power. Google was accused of employing an unfair strategy to stifle competition by paying billions of dollars to companies like Apple and Samsung to allow its search engine to be the default option on their devices and browsers. The ruling also found that Google's monopoly enabled the undertaking to inflate prices for search ads, increasing its revenue to further entrench its dominant position.\n\nMehta stated in the ruling that \"[a]fter having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\" Attorney General Merrick B. Garland responded to the judgment in a press release referring to a \"historic win for the American people.\" He went on to emphasize \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nGoogle has announced plans to appeal the decision with the company's president of global affairs, Kent Walker, highlighting parts of the judgment that acknowledged the company's main argument during the proceedings, namely that its search engine was of superior quality over other competitors. Additionally, Google has contended that its search contracts with competitors were non-exclusionary in nature and thus should not incur liability. Mehta rejected this argument noting that search contracts would disincentivize phone manufacturers and developers of operating systems from working on their own search engines.\n\nThe decision comes in the wake of the DOJ filing a federal antitrust complaint in January 2023. The DOJ had filed similar civil antitrust complaints in 2020 and in April 2022, with Google facing another class action lawsuit over its Google Maps monopoly and acquisition of Waze.

Let's delve deeper into the case and its potential implications for Google and the broader industry.\n\nWhat transpired?\n\nIn 2020, the US Department of Justice sued Google, alleging that the tech giany had abused its online search and advertising dominance to stifle competition and harm consumers. During the trial, attorneys argued that Google's monopoly allowed it to impose artificially high prices on advertisers while also having the luxury of more time and money to enhance its search engine, a strategy that affected consumers.\n\nGoogle, on the other hand, refuted these claims, arguing that consumers have historically switched search engines when they become dissatisfied with the results pointing out how Yahoo once dominated search in the 1990s before Google emerged. However, after several months of evidence review, the judge concluded that Google had violated US antitrust laws in its operations.\n\nWhat did the judge declare?\n\nUS District Judge Amit Mehta, in his ruling, labelled Google a \"monopolist\" that had \"acted as one to maintain its monopoly\". US attorney general Merrick Garland hailed the \"victory against Google as an historic win for the American people\". He said: \"No company, no matter how large or influential, is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.' Google looks set to challenge the judgement, with prospects of the battle ascending to the heights of the US Supreme Court.\n\nWhat does the decision mean for Google and the wider tech sector?\n\nThat's the pivotal inquiry emerging from the lawsuit. The judge's ruling ushers in a subsequent legal chapter where determinations are to be made regarding the amendments or penalties that should be applied to Google to safeguard competitive practices.\n\nThe ramifications of these decrees could seriously shake up the tech industry, with possible outcomes ranging from demanding the dismantling of segments of Googles vast online dominion, to halting its annual investments to maintain Google search as the default on iPhones and other gadgets.\n\nAlternatively, the judge might opt for more subtle adjustments to nurture competitive fairness and consumer protection, allowing Google to emerge with minimal damage. Any changes imposed would come at a critical time in the sector, as Google battles with Microsoft and others to lead the industry as it enters the age of AI.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martyn_landi@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Martyn Landi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "lawrence_matheson@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Lawrence Matheson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/money/article33404788.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_google-argued-that-consumers-have-historically-changed-search-engines-when-they-become-dissatisfied-with-the-results.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Google controls about 90% of the online search market and 95% on smartphones.\n\nThe \"remedy\" phase could be lengthy, followed by potential appeals to the US Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit and the US Supreme Court. The legal wrangling could play out into next year, or even 2026.\n\nShares of Alphabet fell 4.5% on Monday amid a broad decline in tech shares as the wider stock market cratered on recession fears. Google advertising was 77% of Alphabet's total sales in 2023.\n\nAlphabet said it plans to appeal Mehta's ruling. \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Google said in a statement.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the \"pro-competition ruling is a victory for the American people,\" adding that \"Americans deserve an internet that is free, fair, and open for competition.\"\n\nBillions paid\n\nMehta noted that Google had paid $26.3 billion in 2021 alone to ensure that its search engine is the default on smartphones and browsers, and to keep its dominant market share.\n\n\"The default is extremely valuable real estate,\" Mehta wrote. \"Even if a new entrant were positioned from a quality standpoint to bid for the default when an agreement expires, such a firm could compete only if it were prepared to pay partners upwards of billions of dollars in revenue share and make them whole for any revenue shortfalls resulting from the change.\"\n\nHe added, \"Google, of course, recognizes that losing defaults would dramatically impact its bottom line. For instance, Google has projected that losing the Safari default would result in a significant drop in queries and billions of dollars in lost revenues.\"\n\nThe ruling is the first major decision in a series of cases taking on alleged monopolies in Big Tech. This case, filed by the Trump administration, went before a judge from September to November of last year.\n\n\"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, who said a drawn-out legal process would delay any immediate effects for consumers.\n\nIn the past four years, federal antitrust regulators have also sued Meta Platforms, Amazon.com and Apple , claiming the companies have illegally maintained monopolies. Those cases all began under the administration of former President Donald Trump.\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, said the fact that the case spanned administrations shows strong bipartisan support for antitrust enforcement.\n\n\"It's a huge victory for the American people that antitrust enforcement is alive and well when it comes to competition,\" she said. \"Google is a rampant monopolist.\"\n\nWhen it was filed in 2020, the Google search case was the first time in a generation that the U.S. government accused a major corporation of an illegal monopoly.

The company's head of global affairs, Kent Walker, told employees he expects U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta to rule next on potential remedies to Google's behavior -- which he had found to be monopolistic -- a process that should take at least a few months.\n\nWalker on Monday said Mehta's decision \"recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available.\"\n\nHere's what the ruling could mean for some of the biggest companies in the tech industry.\n\nGoogle now faces a range of potential consequences -- almost all of which would reduce the number of search queries it handles.\n\nThe most extreme possibility, pushed by some antitrust activists, would force Google to sell its Chrome browser or Android mobile software businesses, ending its ability to directly integrate search into both.\n\nHerbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Carey Law School and Wharton business school, said Mehta's ruling suggests he is more likely to put an end to Google's practice of paying to be the default search engine on devices and browsers from companies like Apple and Samsung.\n\n\"That would effectively leave each device or browser maker to select its own default search engine, or to impose a choice screen,\" Hovenkamp said. A \"choice screen\" refers to a menu that prompts users to select between several search engines.\n\nGoogle predicted in 2020 that if it wasn't the default search engine on Apple's Safari browser and iOS devices, it would lose between 60% and 80% of queries on iPhones and iPads, resulting in net revenue losses of up to $32.7 billion, according to Mehta's decision. That figure accounts for the money Google would save by not paying Apple.\n\nThe analysis assumed Google would be replaced by another search engine. If users are given a choice screen and most select Google, it might save more money in payments to Apple, Samsung and others than it loses in search advertising, analysts said.\n\nLong an also-ran in online search, Microsoft's Bing would be the most likely beneficiary if fewer people search on Google.\n\nMicrosoft repeatedly tried and failed to convince Apple to make Bing its default search engine, according to court documents and testimony.\n\nAt one point, it proposed giving 100% of its search ad revenue on iPhones and iPads to Apple, or even selling it Bing. But Apple executives concluded the 36% share of revenue they received from Google was more beneficial, partly because that company's search advertising business was more robust.\n\nIf Mehta forbids Google from paying to be a default search engine, Microsoft might become the most attractive replacement for Apple and Samsung. Even if the outcome is users being forced to choose search providers, it could benefit Microsoft. An increase of just a few percentage points in market share would be a big deal for Bing, which has struggled to crack 4% for many years, according to Statcounter data.\n\nMicrosoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said on a conference call with analysts last year her company would get about $2 billion in ad revenue for every percentage point Bing gains in market share.\n\nMehta's ruling threatens the billions of dollars the two biggest mobile phone makers collect from Google.\n\nIn 2022, Google paid Apple about $20 billion for the default placement on its Safari browser and iOS-run mobile devices.\n\nIt also pays Samsung an undisclosed amount to be the default search engine on that company's phones. Samsung gets 80% of its on-device search revenue from queries through a Google search feature on home screens and Chrome, the pre-installed browser, according to Mehta's ruling.\n\nInstead of turning to Bing or making users choose, either company could create their own search engine. Building the technical infrastructure to match Google would cost Apple as much as $20 billion, according to a 2020 internal Google estimate cited in Mehta's ruling.\n\nThe uptake of generative AI sparked by the debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022 has caused many to question whether traditional internet search engines will become a dying breed.\n\nPeople can get answers from ChatGPT and other AI applications, including one from Google, that they have traditionally turned to search engines for. In addition, OpenAI in July debuted an early version of a search engine it said would become part of ChatGPT, further threatening to disrupt a landscape long dominated by Google.\n\nIf Google is no longer the default search engine on phones and browsers, more people could turn to AI as they seek alternatives.\n\nOpenAI has also secured a prime position for ChatGPT in a revamped version of Apple's voice assistant Siri, an arrangement that could siphon search traffic from Google. The iPhone maker has said it also plans to make Google's Gemini chatbot available through the service, called Apple Intelligence.\n\nMehta sounded a note of caution in his ruling on the potential for companies like OpenAI to compete with Google. \"AI has not supplanted the traditional ingredients that define general search,\" he wrote.\n\nNews Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, has a content-licensing partnership with OpenAI.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania_Law_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Pennsylvania Law School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google Chrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_Corp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "News Corp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Hood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amy Hood"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/08/06/600x338/Global-Tech-Outage-Future-Shock-0_1722941412471_1722941432857.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The judge said that Google has secured various contracts to be the default search engine on various devices, giving it a major advantage in the market.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" the court said in its verdict.\n\nThe US court said Google has entered into distribution contracts with browser developers, mobile device manufacturers and wireless carriers, which means Google is the default search engine \"right out of the box at key search access points\". The judge found that Google has \"monopoly power\" in the general search market and that its distribution agreements have \"anticompetitive effects\".\n\nThe US complaints against Google were first issued in 2020 by the US Department of Justice after an investigation into Big Tech competition. The department issued two separate lawsuits against the tech giant. This particular antitrust case was massive, with the court ruling noting how \"millions of pages exchanged hands\" during the trial.\n\nThe verdict did not include what penalties Google should face, but the decision is a major blow to the tech giant, which has faced scrutiny for years over its practices. Alphabet is facing a \u00a313.6bn lawsuit brought forward by online publishers in the UK accusing the tech giant of anticompetitive behaviour in the adtech space.\n\nThere are speculations that the verdict could lead to the tech giant being broken up into smaller entities and could have a significant impact on the tech sector. This is due to the fact it bears many similarities to a monopoly case against Microsoft in 1998, which ruled that the company had attempted to monpolise the PC market.\n\nThat case ruled that Microsoft should be split into two companies, one which would handle its operating system and another that would handle everything else. This ruling never took place as Microsoft reached a different settlement in 2001, but it could be used as a precedent for the current case against Google.\n\nGoogle did not respond to media requests for comment, but its president of global affairs Kent Walker said the company will appeal the decision, The Guardian reports.\n\nFind out how emerging tech trends are transforming tomorrow with our new podcast, Future Human: The Series.

It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act,\" Mehta wrote in his ruling.\n\nAlthough Google is expected to appeal the decision, the findings, if upheld, could outlaw contracts that for years all but assured Google's search advertising dominance.\n\nIn 2023, Google's search advertising business generated more than $175 billion in revenue.\n\nCoupled with Google's YouTube ads and Google network revenue, both of which it promotes on its general search engine, advertising accounted for a staggering $237 billion of the company's $307 billion in total revenue.\n\nAs of June 2023, Google controlled 91% of the global search engine market across all computing platforms, according to Statcounter. On mobile, Google's market share was even higher at 95%.\n\nNearly four years ago, in October 2020, when the DOJ and states filed suit, Google's annual revenue was $162 billion, roughly half of its most recently reported revenue for the year.\n\nThe decision is a huge win for the Justice Department and could have giant implications for some of the other big names in the tech world.\n\nThat's because Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims.\n\nThe scrutiny is part of a wide-ranging effort by the Biden administration to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries, from healthcare to groceries to tech.\n\nThe Google decision comes after a two-month trial late last year that included testimony from Google's CEO Sundar Pichai, as well as executives from search market rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and DuckDuckGo.\n\nThe DOJ and 35 states, along with Guam, Puerto Rico. and the District of Columbia, accused Google in separate lawsuits of unfairly holding on to its market dominance in search, including search engines, search engine advertising, and search engine text advertising.\n\nThe cases were handled together because of their nearly identical allegations that said Google held on to its monopoly by paying companies like Apple, Amazon, Mozilla, and Firefox to make Google the default search provider on mobile phones, tablets, and browsers.\n\nAt the time of the lawsuit, Google held a 90% share in online search. At trial, its lawyers said Google earned and held on to that outsized share not by anticompetitive conduct, but by providing a superior product.\n\nGoogle's disputed behavior revolved around contracts it entered into with manufacturers of computer devices and mobile devices, as well as with browser services, browser developers, and wireless carriers.\n\nThese contracts, the government claimed, violated antitrust laws because they made Google the mandatory default search provider.\n\nCompanies that entered into those exclusive contracts have included Apple, LG, Samsung, AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Mozilla. Those deals are why smartphones from manufacturers including Samsung, one of the world's largest smartphone makers, come preloaded with Google's various apps.\n\nAt trial, Google claimed that despite holding monopolies in the search markets, its contracts neither violated antitrust laws nor harmed competition.\n\nMicrosoft's Bing accounts for just 3.74% of the global market across all platforms, while Yahoo Finance's affiliate company Yahoo accounts for 1.16%. In the US, Google controls 87% of the search market on all platforms. Bing has 7.2%, Yahoo has 2.4%, and DuckDuckGo has 1.9%. On mobile, Google captures 95% of the US search market.\n\nThe global search industry is also in the midst of a massive shift as companies increasingly add generative AI responses to their services.\n\nGoogle has added its AI Overviews feature to its standard search service, providing users with generative AI-powered answers to their queries that summarize content found on various websites in a dedicated window about the search engine's standard website links.\n\nMicrosoft offers its Copilot feature in its Bing search engine, which provides similar functionality to Google's AI Overviews.\n\nThe move to generative AI-powered search results raises additional questions about the fate of the search industry, including whether websites that are used to summarize AI results receive the appropriate credit for their contributions.\n\nSimilarly, the features have increased concerns that providing users with answers to their queries in a box that grabs content from third-party websites will keep users from visiting those sites, which would dramatically impact their page views and revenue.\n\nAt the end of the trial, legal experts predicted that the DOJ's landmark cases against Microsoft in 1998 and AT&T in 1974 could be instructive to the outcome of its Google case.\n\nAll three cases are \"vertical foreclosure cases,\" antitrust challenges that target companies that use the vertical integration of their different businesses or services to foreclose on competition.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The decision reaches a head after the case nears 4 years in progress.\n\nAn antitrust lawsuit was brought against Google in 2020 that alleged Google embraced a monopolistic attitude in promoting Google Search. The lawsuit indicates the DOJ sued Google over several actions, which include paying browsers, carriers, and mobile phone manufacturers to stay the most visible search engine on the web.\n\nIt was reported that Google paid Apple $26 billion so it could remain the default search engine in the company's web browser and devices. Because of this, the DOJ ruled that Google broke the law. The ruling was finalized on August 5, 2024 after the Department of Justice first brought the case up in 2020 (via Bloomberg).\n\nThe case as a whole specifically targeted Google's tendency to attempt to maintain the default position in mobile phone browsers. The payments made to these companies to ensure that remained the case is what the DOJ regards as an illegal act.\n\nThe court's official ruling goes against Google in the antitrust suit, calling Google a monopolist in action and attitude. The court document concludes District Judge Amit Mehta's notes on the lawsuit ruling regarding Google's search engine reach.\n\nThe court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\n\nGoogle has since posted a statement on Twitter/X, noting that the court often referred to Google Search as a superior product.\n\nGoogle's next steps could involve appealing to the U.S. District Court of Appeal. The court may also require Google to make significant changes in its search engine strategy after the lawsuit. The court ruling was finalized just today, so there are no further actions on the list. That likely won't be the case for long.

Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nGoogle almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may land in the U..S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out more than $20 billion annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nGoogle still faces other legal threats besides this one, both in the U.S. and abroad. any antitrust lawsuits brought against Google domestically and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dayton Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet of things"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.daytondailynews.com/resizer/IosbX0ZiKCZj5G1FaiTQENiWi8k=/1200x630/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coxohio/GLBBN73P52DHQGNHJ2SU7YQH3E.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

a \"big tech\" giant could alter how the sector operates in future.\n\nDistrict Court Judge Amit Mehta found that Google had a monopoly for search and for text ads through exclusive distribution agreements that made it the \"default\" option that people were likely to use on devices.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote in his ruling.\n\nThe internet behemoth \"has a major, largely unseen advantage over its rivals: default distribution,\" he wrote.\n\nThe anti-trust trial pitting US prosecutors and nearly a dozen states against Google ended in May.\n\n\"This victory against Google is an historic win for the American people,\" said US Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law.\"\n\nGoogle will appeal the verdict, according to global affairs president Kent Walker.\n\nWalker pointed out that Mehta concludes Google is the industry's highest quality search engine, particularly on mobile devices.\n\n\"Given this, and that people are increasingly looking for information in more and more ways, we plan to appeal,\" Walker said.\n\n\"As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use.\"\n\nIt remained to be seen what remedies or damages the judge might order in the case.\n\nIn one possible good sign for Google, Mehta concluded in his ruling that the tech titan's violation of the Sherman Act did not have \"anticompetitive effects.\"\n\n\"Google's loss in its search antitrust trial could be a huge deal -- depending on the remedy,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf.\n\n\"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue,\" she added, referring to Google's parent company.\n\nEven losing the option of making exclusive deals to be the default option on browsers, smartphones or computers would hurt Google, according to the analyst.\n\nGoogle's search business would be hampered as generative artificial intelligence wielded by Microsoft's Bing and OpenAI budding \"SearchGPT\" ramp up competition.\n\n\"The biggest winner from today's ruling isn't consumers or little tech, it's Microsoft,\" said Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich.\n\n\"Microsoft has underinvested in search for decades, but today's ruling opens the door to a court mandate of default deals for Bing.\"\n\nMitchell-Wolf expected a drawn-out appeals process to delay any immediate effects of the verdict on consumers or advertisers.\n\nThe trial was the first time the US Department of Justice has faced a big tech company in court since Microsoft was targeted more than two decades ago over the dominance of its Windows operating system.\n\nMehta presided over several months of testimony late last year that saw Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other top executives take the stand.\n\nAt the heart of the government's case was the massive payments made by Google to Apple and other companies to keep its world-leading search engine as the default on iPhones, web browsers and other products.\n\nCourt testimony revealed that these payments reach the tens of billions of dollars every year to keep its prime real estate on Apple hardware or the Safari and Mozilla browsers.\n\nJustice department lawyers argued that Google achieved and perpetuated its dominance -- and strangled rivals -- through these default deals that also expanded to Samsung and other device makers.", "source": {"uri": "spacedaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SpaceDaily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta noted that Google had paid $26.3 billion in 2021 alone to ensure that its search engine is the default on smartphones and browsers, and to keep its dominant market share.\n\n\"The court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nMehta's ruling against Alphabet's major revenue driver paves the way for a second trial to determine potential fixes, such as requiring the company to stop paying smartphone makers billions of dollars annually to set Google as the default search engine on new phones.\n\n\"The default is extremely valuable real estate... Even if a new entrant were positioned from a quality standpoint to bid for the default when an agreement expires, such a firm could compete only if it were prepared to pay partners upwards of billions of dollars in revenue share and make them whole for any revenue shortfalls resulting from the change,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nHe noted \"Google, of course, recognizes that losing defaults would dramatically impact its bottom line. For instance, Google has projected that losing the Safari default would result in a significant drop in queries and billions of dollars in lost revenues.\" The ruling is the first major decision in a series of cases taking on alleged monopolies in Big Tech.\n\nIn the past four years, federal antitrust regulators have also sued Meta Platforms, Amazon.com, and Apple Inc, claiming the companies have illegally maintained monopolies. Another case against Google over its advertising technology is scheduled to go to trial in September.\n\nWhen it was filed in 2020, the Google search case was the first time in a generation that the U.S. government accused a major corporation of an illegal monopoly.

Judge Mehta will determine the mandates, which could include significant changes to Google's business practices or even the divestiture of some business operations.\n\nThe case is likely to influence future antitrust litigation and regulatory actions against tech monopolies in the US, setting a precedent for how century-old antitrust laws can be applied to the modern digital economy.\n\nGoogle is currently facing another antitrust case concerning its advertising technology business.

The tech giant was condemned by a federal judge in the United States for illegally maintaining a monopoly in online searches, setting a significant precedent that could profoundly alter the operations of major tech companies.\n\nThis ruling is the result of one of many cases driven by the U.S. Department of Justice, aiming to regulate the activities of major tech corporations.\n\nThe decision, issued by Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, concludes that Google has abused its dominant market position to strengthen and maintain its monopoly, primarily through multi-billion dollar payments to companies like Apple and Samsung to ensure Google remains the default search engine on mobile devices and web browsers.\n\nDuring the 10-week trial, it was revealed how Google cut off essential distribution channels for its competitors through exclusive and restrictive contracts.\n\nREAD ALSO: From Allyson Felix to Simone Biles: Athletes Who Said No to Nike and Championed Sisterhood Marketing\n\nFor instance, agreements with Samsung to make Google the default search engine on its devices. Additionally, it was exposed that Google conditions access to its Play Store app store on Android device manufacturers pre-installing certain Alphabet apps by default.\n\nIn its defense, Google argued that its market dominance is the result of developing a superior product compared to its competitors and that users have the freedom to quickly and easily switch search engines.\n\nHowever, this stance was rejected by the court, which found that Google's practices have hindered competition and unfairly reinforced its monopoly.\n\nThe ruling paves the way for a second trial to determine potential legal consequences, which could include prohibiting Google from continuing its practice of paying manufacturers to position itself as the default search engine.\n\nThis could have significant repercussions not only in the United States but also in other markets where Google has a dominant presence.\n\nThis ruling not only affects Google but could also influence future antitrust actions by the U.S. government against other major tech companies like Apple, Amazon, and Meta.\n\nSome key facts about the resolution and the monopoly trial against Google are:", "source": {"uri":

'The prospect of losing tens of billions in guaranteed revenue from Google - which presently come at little to no cost to Apple - disincentivizes Apple from launching its own search engine when it otherwise has built the capacity to do so,' he wrote.\"\n\nThe New York Times reported: \"The ruling is a harsh verdict on the rise of giant technology companies that have used their roots in the internet to influence the way we shop, consume information and search online - and indicates a potential limit of Big Tech's power.\n\n\"It is likely to influence other government antitrust lawsuits against Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The last significant antitrust ruling against a tech company targeted Microsoft more than two decades ago. ...\n\n\"The decision is a major blow to Google, which was built on its search engine and has become so closely associated with online search that its name has become a verb. The ruling could have major ramifications for Google's success, especially as the company spends heavily to compete in the race over artificial intelligence. Google faces another federal antitrust case over ad technology that is scheduled to go to trial next month.\"\n\nIs the news we hear every day actually broadcasting messages from God? The answer is an absolute yes! Find out how!\n\nIn April, \"Google agreed to destroy billions of data records to settle a lawsuit claiming it secretly tracked the internet use of people who thought they were browsing privately,\" CNBC reported.\n\nIn March, a study by the Media Research Center confirmed Google has interfered in American elections an astonishing 41 times in recent years.\n\nDan Schneider, MRC's Free Speech America vice president, and Gabriela Pariseau, editor, said in a summary, \"MRC researchers have found 41 times where Google interfered in elections over the last 16 years, and its impact has surged dramatically, making it evermore harmful to democracy. In every case, Google harmed the candidates - regardless of party - who threatened its left-wing candidate of choice.\"\n\nTheir report continued, \"From the mouths of Google executives, the tech giant let slip what was never meant to be made public: That Google uses its 'great strength and resources and reach' to advance its leftist values. Google's outsized influence on information technology, the body politic and American elections became evident in 2008. After failing to prevent then-candidate for president Donald Trump from being inaugurated following the 2016 election, Google has since made clear to any discerning observer that it has been -- and will continue -- interfering in America's elections.\"\n\nStudy: Google has interfered in U.S. elections 41 TIMES!\n\nContent created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Other firms, including Apple, Meta and Amazon, also face federal antitrust lawsuits.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta wrote in his opinion.\n\nThe ruling did not include a remedy for Google's conduct.\n\nKent Walker, president of Google Global Affairs, said in a statement that the company plans to appeal.\n\n\"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" he said. \"As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use.\"\n\nRegulators alleged that Google maintained a monopoly on web searches by reaching agreements with browser developers, phone manufacturers and wireless carriers to pre-load their products with the Google search engine as the default.\n\nBy agreeing to partner with Google, the companies receive a portion of the advertising revenue Google generates through the search process, the ruling said.\n\nIn 2021, Google paid out a total of $26.3 billion in revenue share under its contracts with browser developers Apple and Mozilla, major manufacturers of Android devices such as Samsung and Motorola, and U.S. wireless carriers including AT&T and Verizon, according to the ruling.\n\nThat amount was Google's greatest expense that year, the ruling said. That same year, Google earned more than $146 billion in advertising revenue, according to the ruling.\n\n\"These distribution deals have forced Google's rivals to find other ways to reach users,\" the ruling said.\n\nThe Mountain View-based subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. has increasingly cornered the market for web searching. In 2009, 80% of U.S. web searches went through Google. By 2020, that figure was nearly 90%, according to the ruling. Almost 95% of mobile searches used Google.\n\nGoogle's next closest competitor -- Microsoft's Bing -- took up just 6% of web searches, the ruling said.\n\nThis dominance of the search market caught the attention of antitrust regulators, and by 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice and multiple state attorneys general had filed two separate lawsuits against the tech giant.\n\nDuring the course of legal proceedings, dozens of witnesses were deposed, including high-ranking tech executives. The bench trial started in September 2023 and lasted for nine weeks. Closing arguments occurred in May.\n\nIt's not yet clear what the ruling will mean for Google, particularly since the company plans to appeal and there will be further proceedings about potential remedies.\n\n\"We're still in the middle of the game, as opposed to the end of the game,\" said Colin Kass, a partner in the litigation department at Proskauer and co-head of the firm's antitrust group.\n\nBut if the ruling stands, it could force Google to revisit how it does deals with outside companies for the opportunity to be the default search engine, said Jef Pearlman, clinical professor of law and director of the intellectual property and technology law clinic at the USC Gould School of Law.\n\n\"If it stands, this will limit their current approach,\" he said.\n\nThe ruling is less likely to have an effect on the other pending tech federal antitrust cases, mostly because the Google case focues so narrowly on the market for web searches, which is not relevant to the other lawsuits, legal experts said.\n\nBut it could serve as a warning for artificial intelligence companies, which are starting to make deals with outside companies to use their technology and could run into similar issues as Google did with its default search engine agreements.\n\nThough the AI market is still nascent, \"they will be thinking of this as they pen those deals,\" Pearlman said.",

The court found that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which outlaws monopolies.\n\nThe ruling marks the first anti-monopoly decision against a tech company in decades.\n\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Judge Amit Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia wrote in the decision.\n\nThe Department of Justice and a bipartisan group of attorneys general from 38 states and territories, led by Colorado and Nebraska, filed similar but separate antitrust suits against Google in 2020. The suits were combined for pretrial purposes, such as discovery of evidence.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland called the decision a \"historic win for the American people.\"\n\n\"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law,\" Garland wrote in a statement. \"The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nIn its ruling, the court homed in on Google's exclusive search arrangements on Android and Apple's iPhone and iPad devices, saying that they helped to cement Google's anticompetitive behavior and dominance over the search markets.\n\nGeneral search services, according to the court, applies to Google's core search engine, where it traditionally competed with Yahoo. General search text advertising refers to the text ads that run alongside search results. The court ruled that in both of those areas, Google has operated as a monopoly. However, the ruling found that general search advertising is not a market so there can be no monopoly control.\n\nKent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said in a statement that the company plans to appeal the ruling. He highlighted the court's emphasis on the quality of Google's products.\n\n\"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Walker wrote. \"As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use.\"\n\nAlphabet shares fell more than 4% on Monday, dragged down by a broad decline in stocks worldwide.", "source": {"uri": "qnewshub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "QNewsHub"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aman_desai@qnewshub.com", "name": "Aman Desai", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sherman Antitrust Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barriers_to_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barriers to entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the District of Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Information_Retrieval", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Information Retrieval", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Search_Engines", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Search Engines", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Economy_and_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Economy and Trading", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://i2.wp.com/image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107051971-gettyimages-1239592984-wlodarczyk-googlece220329_npUyj.jpeg?v=1651007251&w=1920&h=1080&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

It's the first major tech company since Microsoft in 2001 to be found guilty of antitrust-like behaviors.\n\nIn a lengthy ruling, Judge Amit Mehta in a federal court in Washington, D.C., writes that Google abused its monopoly on search.\n\nHaving a monopoly is not illegal, but acting to keep one, in whatever form those actions take, often is illegal.\n\nThe most interesting number in the trial, however, concerns where most people do their Googling: on their phones.\n\nIf you live in the U.S., there's more than half a chance you use an iPhone: An estimate in a Department of Justice complaint puts the number at 60% for Apple's iPhone market share in the U.S.\n\nThe amount of money that Google paid Apple to be the default search engine on iPhones in 2021 is an eye-wateringly high number, but if your phone controls more than half of the U.S. market, you can command a very high sum from Google.\n\nMonday's ruling (read the full PDF of the ruling here) is the most significant part of a trial that ran from September to November 2023, and illustrates just how important one enormous sum -- first revealed in October 2023 during the trial -- became to the judgment.\n\nThe most interesting and essential part of the trial might be this number: $26.3 billion. In a slide revealed at the trial on October 27, 2023, Google paid $26.3 billion to browser companies, phone makers, and wireless carriers to be the default search engine.\n\nThe New York Times reported that \"around $18 billion\" was to Apple. The rest went to other companies like Samsung, L.G., Motorola, and phone carriers like AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and web browsers like Mozilla and Opera.\n\nIf you're curious, dig into the 2020 federal complaint against Google. It explains revenue-sharing agreements, or RSAs, wherein \"Google generally requires exclusive distribution as the sole preset default general search service on an ever-expanding list of search access points.\"\n\nIn return, Google would pay those companies a percentage of advertising revenue from searches. It should be noted here that Google also benefited from the data it collected on user behaviors and macro-search trends, which it could monetize via miscellaneous methods.\n\nMehta in his ruling, is clear: \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\"\n\nIn response to the ruling on Monday, Google's President of Global Affairs, Kent Walker, struck a slightly defiant tone:\n\n\"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Walker said in a statement released to the press. \"As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use.\"\n\nGoogle has had a grip on search for more than a decade. In 2009, the ruling notes, nearly 80% of internet searches in the U.S. were through Google.\n\n\"Follow the money,\" that old journalism phrase borne out of the Watergate scandal, also rings true in the ruling: Where large sums are being exchanged, scrutiny may follow.\n\nWhat's next? For Google, a lot.\n\nFor one, a new trial will be held to determine Google's punishment in this trial.\n\nAnd in September, a new, different federal trial is scheduled to start, as the Department of Justice argues that Google's advertising tech is an illegal monopoly.", "source": {"uri": "laptopmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LaptopMag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_lucchesi@laptopmag.com", "name": "Nick Lucchesi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motorola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Verizon Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AT&T"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_network_operator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile network operator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mozilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Watergate scandal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9pbSqwv9nCWi4ZgxAVysrW-1200-80.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Mehta in the ruling, \"and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\"\n\nThe Department of Justice's case centered on Google's payments to other companies, like Apple and Samsung, to give its search engine prominence on their devices.\n\nFor Google, there's apparently a very good reason to keep these payments coming, as the search revenue generated is worth billions.\n\nAccording to Monday's filing, the company estimated in 2017 that its default placements across Safari, Firefox, and other browsers drove 54% of its search revenue. That number has only increased.\n\nIn particular, Google has a major deal with Apple to keep Google the default search engine on Safari, which runs on iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers worldwide.\n\nIn 2020, Google projected that it would lose between 60% and 80% of its search volume on Apple devices if it were replaced as the default general search engine, the filing said. That accounts for between $28.2 billion and $32.7 billion in net revenue losses, it added.\n\n\"Google's distribution agreements are exclusive and have anticompetitive effects,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nEddy Cue, senior vice president of services at Apple, revealed in court documents earlier this year that Google paid $20 billion in 2022 to secure this spot, which amounted to 17.5% of Apple's operating income. So, any remedy that stops or reduces Google's search payments would be bad news for Apple, too.\n\nThe landmark decision on Monday marked the near-conclusion of the DOJ's lawsuit against the search company, which was filed in 2020.\n\nWhat happens next is still unknown, as the ruling did not include remedies.\n\nGoogle's president of global affairs, Kent Walker, told Business Insider in a statement that the company plans to appeal; this could be drawn out for a while longer.\n\nThe ruling will undoubtedly have Google leaders concerned, particularly if remedies include forcing it to break up with Apple.\n\nSome experts previously floated a worst-case scenario for Google where it's barred from bidding for the default position on devices while competitors still can, although this may be an extreme scenario.\n\nEven so, anything that pushes Google out of that default spot on Apple's devices could be very bad news for the search giant -- and it knows it.\n\nAre you a Google employee?

The search giant had breached law by using exclusivity agreements to maintain a monopoly on general search services and general text advertising.\n\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Judge Mehta noted in the ruling. While Google's market share in 2009 was nearly 80% in the search engine, it had only increased further to 90% by 2020, the judge noted. By comparison, its closest competitors, Bing and Yahoo, hold less than 6% and 2.5% market share, respectively. There's also privacy browser Duck Duck Go, which currently holds a market share of just 2.1%.\n\nGoogle plans to appeal the ruling.\n\n\"We appreciate the court's finding that Google is 'the industry's highest quality search engine, which has earned Google the trust of hundreds of millions of daily users,' that Google 'has long been the best search engine, particularly on mobile devices,' 'has continued to innovate in search' and that 'Apple and Mozilla occasionally assess Google's search quality relative to its rivals and find Google's to be superior'.

Circuit.\n\nShares of Google parent Alphabet fell 4.3% on Monday as part of a broad tech share decline.\n\nMehta noted that Google had paid $26.3 billion in 2021 alone to ensure that its search engine is the default on smartphones and browsers, and to keep its dominant market share.\n\n\"The default is extremely valuable real estate... Even if a new entrant were positioned from a quality standpoint to bid for the default when an agreement expires, such a firm could compete only if it were prepared to pay partners upwards of billions of dollars in revenue share and make them whole for any revenue shortfalls resulting from the change,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nHe noted \"Google, of course, recognizes that losing defaults would dramatically impact its bottom line. For instance, Google has projected that losing the Safari default would result in a significant drop in queries and billions of dollars in lost revenues.\"\n\nThe ruling is the first major decision in a series of cases taking on alleged monopolies in Big Tech.\n\n\"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, who noted a drawn out legal process will delay any immediate effects for consumers.\n\nIn the past four years, federal antitrust regulators have also sued Meta Platforms, Amazon.com, and Apple Inc, claiming the companies have illegally maintained monopolies. Another case against Google over its advertising technology is scheduled to go to trial in September.\n\nWhen it was filed in 2020, the Google search case was the first time in a generation that the U.S. government accused a major corporation of an illegal monopoly. Microsoft settled with the Justice Department in 2004 over claims that it forced its Internet Explorer web browser on Windows users.\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson, Mike Scarcella and Chris Sanders

Per The Washington Post, Google illegally abused its power to maintain its massive market share. In other words, [Googles \"word for company illegally abusing power to maintain market dominance\"], \"Google is a monopolist,\" wrote Judge Amit Mehta, U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, \"and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\"\n\nPutting aside all the obvious, user-specific reasons why Google sucks now (the ads, lack of precise and helpful search results, bogus summaries encouraging one to eat glue, etc.), the basis of Judge Mehta's argument is how Google maintains its market share. Ironically, the company doesn't keep customers by forcing them to lament, \"I can't believe how bad Google is these days.\" Actually, it's Google's quashing and gatekeeping competition. Judge Mehta finds Google's penchant for paying Apple an estimated $19 billion to make Google the default search engine for Apple products to be out of bounds, unfairly bending market forces in Google's direction. Mehta also found that despite no real competition (sorry, Bing), Google consistently and incrementally raised prices. By increasing its prices over a protracted period, Google avoided the \"pitfalls\" of \"potential advertiser outcry and bad publicity\" because \"many advertisers do not even realize that Google is responsible for the changes in price.\"\n\nOf course, Google argued that it's successful because it's the best and not because it's the default on every device people buy. However, any Googler who has Googled in that last year knows Google isn't Googling as well as it used to. Most of this stems from Google placing its Head of Ads, Prabhakar Raghavan, in charge of Search, leading to one of those \"number go up,\" \"growth at any cost situations\" that has created such a sustainable economy for us to suffer. Per the ruling, Google may have to live up to its reputation or find another way to quash and gatekeep competition.\n\nThe judge has yet to rule on \"remedies\" for the internet's untenable Google problem. Most likely outcomes include a court blockage on Google's search placement payments to Apple. The Washington Post suggests that users could select Google as one of several search engines when they start their device. Apple may not like losing out on the $19 billion a year, but, uh, who cares? What's $19 billion to a company worth $3 trillion? Speaking of the world's most popular cellphone company, Apple is also under antitrust investigation with several other tech firms, including Amazon and Meta. Oh, no, please leave Facebook alone. That's our most valuable resource of A.I.-generated images of flight attendants saluting a shrimp Jesus. Amen.\n\nThis is the first time antitrust has been invoked against a major tech platform since Microsoft was deemed a monopoly for forcing users to use Internet Explorer, probably amounting to war crimes in certain nations. So, none of this looks too good for Google. The company may be forced to change its practices in a way that doesn't harm consumers or competition. Thankfully, Google is AI-powered now.

Its president of global affairs, Kent Walker, said \"this decision recognises that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available\".\n\nNevertheless, the landmark decision has shaken the foundation of Google's business, its search engine. For well over a decade, Google has been the dominant search engine in the market. The tech giant reportedly controls around 90% of the US online search market, leaving little room for competitors to make any claim.\n\nGoogle has been able to maintain this dominance through exclusive contracts with companies such as Apple and Samsung, which enable Google to be the default search engine on their platforms.\n\nThese monopolistic practices have allowed Google to charge high prices for search advertising. Being the default browser across many platforms, this search engine has become the easiest, quickest and most reliable resource for most people. This has reinforced the company's online advertising business, leaving little room for competitors to offer comparable services at more reasonable prices.\n\nWhat does this mean for Google?\n\nA separate proceeding will be held to determine what penalties Google and its parent company, Alphabet, will face. However, it is likely the tech giant will be hit with both monetary penalties and enforced mitigations aimed at reducing its dominance.\n\nHistorically, fines have not been the sole method of enforcing antitrust laws as they do not demonstrate long-term impacts. This is especially true for a multi-trillion-dollar organisation such as Google.\n\nSome of the mitigations which may be imposed include the implementation of a \"choice screen\". This would allow users to pick between other available search engines, instead of having Google as the default option.\n\nThis is not the first time Google has been found guilty of breaching antitrust laws. Over the past decade it has been fined a total of \u20ac8.25 billion (A$13.6 billion) by the European Union for three separate breaches of the union's antitrust laws.\n\nAntitrust laws are enforced at domestic levels, and breaches of these laws are specific to domestic markets. This is why Google is facing these charges across two different continents.\n\nGoogle has continued to appeal the EU fines over the years. Walker has already confirmed that the company will appeal the US decision.\n\nWhat does this mean for internet users?\n\nAntitrust laws are designed to enhance competition. They exist to protect consumers by prohibiting business practices that promote unfair monopolies, suppress competition and enforce dominance or power.\n\nThe dominance that Google has held over other search engines has created a concentrated market that has prevented smaller competitors from operating equitably.\n\nThis is why Google can charge high advertising prices, because there is slim competition in terms of visibility.\n\nThe recent US ruling, alongside the EU rulings, may be the first steps towards opening the tech market up to other competitors. In turn, this may promote more equitable competition, which would be a win for consumers.\n\nCompetition fuels incentives for innovation. When there is only one option available, as often seems to be the case with search engines, this incentive is suffocated under the dominance of one monopolistic player.\n\nWhile antitrust laws are only enforced at domestic levels, hopefully the outcomes of the EU and US rulings will have flow-on effects that extend beyond these markets.\n\nWhat does this mean for the race for AI supremacy?\n\nDuring the trial, some concerns were raised around how Google's monopolised position as the default search engine has unfairly benefited it in the artificial intelligence (AI) race.\n\nThe default agreements and terms of conditions of the Google search engine has enabled the organisation to access enormous amounts of user search data, which can be used to train AI models. The easy access to this data may act as a gateway for Google to establish a position of dominance in AI.\n\nDismantling Google as the default search engine on platforms such as Apple and Samsung could shift Google's position in the race for AI supremacy.\n\nAs such, it may also shift the future trajectory of the entire internet.", "source": {"uri": "theconversation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Conversation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conversation_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Conversation (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_National_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian National University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://images.theconversation.com/files/611663/original/file-20240806-21-z3lit5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C336%2C5760%2C2880&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Image Credit: Reuters\n\nIn a major development that can potentially change the dynamics of how we as users browse the internet, Google has been found guilty of violating US antitrust laws.\n\nA federal judge ruled that Google monopolised both the advertising and search markets, marking a crucial moment in the US Department of Justice's (DOJ) antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet, Google's parent company.\n\nThis decision came after an extensive ten-week trial overseen by Judge Amit Metha, who concluded that Google breached Section 2 of the Sherman Act.\n\nThe ruling supports the DOJ's claims that Google operated as an illegal monopoly, particularly in the search and online advertising sectors.\n\nHowever, this verdict only addresses Google's liability, with no immediate decisions on fines or other penalties. This case is just one of several legal challenges Google faces in 2024, with another trial set for September to address its advertising technology practices.\n\nGoogle's Response and Plans for Appeal\n\nIn response to the ruling, Kent Walker, Google's President of Global Affairs, acknowledged the decision while defending Google's position. Walker noted that while the court recognised Google as the highest-quality search engine, it concluded that Google's methods of maintaining its monopoly were unacceptable.\n\n\"We appreciate the Court's finding that Google is 'the industry's highest quality search engine, which has earned Google the trust of hundreds of millions of daily users,' that Google 'has long been the best search engine, particularly on mobile devices,' 'has continued to innovate in search' and that 'Apple and Mozilla occasionally assess Google's search quality relative to its rivals and find Google's to be superior,\" he said.\n\nThe court highlighted Google's consistent superiority in search quality, particularly on mobile devices, and its ongoing innovations in the field. Despite this acknowledgement, Google plans to appeal the decision, emphasising its commitment to creating user-friendly and helpful products as the legal process continues.\n\nDetails of the DOJ's Case Against Google\n\nThe DOJ's lawsuit argued that Google maintained its monopoly status by making substantial payments to other companies to ensure its dominance as the default search engine. Notably, Google paid Apple $20 billion in 2022 to keep Google as the default search engine on Apple devices.\n\nThis substantial payment was revealed during the trial, where several Apple executives were called to testify. Despite attempts by Apple to avoid the subpoenas, high-ranking officials such as Eddy Cue, John Giannandrea, and Adrian Perica provided crucial evidence.\n\nThe trial also uncovered that Microsoft had attempted to replace Google as the default search engine on Apple's Safari browser by offering Apple 90 per cent of its advertising revenue. Microsoft even proposed selling Bing to Apple in 2020, highlighting the competitive dynamics within the search engine market.\n\nPotential Implications for Google's Financial Arrangements\n\nThe regular billion-dollar payments from Google to Apple have been highly lucrative for the latter, accounting for a significant portion of Google's ad revenue from searches conducted via Safari on iPhones.\n\nHowever, this financial arrangement may be in jeopardy following the DOJ's legal victory. Google's potential break-up, as hinted by Judge Metha, could disrupt these payments, creating financial uncertainties for both companies.\n\nFurthermore, in July, reports indicated that Google sought to reduce its reliance on Apple for search traffic and revenue, suggesting a shift in strategy amidst mounting legal pressures.\n\nThe future of these annual payments remains uncertain, and the outcome of Google's appeal will likely play a critical role in shaping the company's financial and operational landscape moving forward.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sherman Antitrust Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sundar Pichai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mozilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Giannandrea", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Giannandrea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_Cue", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eddy Cue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/08/Googles-monopolist-ruling-for-search-and-ads-may-change-how-we-browse-the-internet-2024-08-83c3df5559b99bcbd8278bda1812cced-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Mehta noted that Google paid $26.3 billion in 2021 to ensure its search engine remains the default on smartphones and browsers, maintaining its dominant market share.\n\nThe ruling is the first major decision in a series of cases taking on alleged monopolies in Big Tech. Filed by the Trump administration, the case was heard from September to November. \"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet (GOOG) from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. In the past four years, federal antitrust regulators have also sued Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL), claiming illegal monopolies. Another case against Google (GOOGL) over its advertising technology is scheduled for trial in September.", "source": {"uri": "quiverquant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "quiverquant.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_District_of_Columbia_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Internet_Marketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Internet Marketing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Economy_and_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Economy and Trading", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Googleplex_HQ_%28cropped%29.jpg/640px-Googleplex_HQ_%28cropped%29.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

anti-trust case", "body": "A US judge on Monday handed Google a major legal blow, ruling in a closely-watched anti-trust case that it has a monopoly with its dominant search engine.\n\nThe landmark decision against a \"big tech\" giant could alter how the sector operates in future.\n\nDistrict Court Judge Amit Mehta found that Google maintained a monopoly for search and for text ads through exclusive distribution agreements that made it the \"default\" option that people were likely to use on devices.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote in his ruling.\n\nThe internet behemoth \"has a major, largely unseen advantage over its rivals: default distribution,\" he added.\n\nThe anti-trust trial pitting US prosecutors against Google ended in May with a two-day hearing.\n\nThe case was the first of five major lawsuits by the US government to reach trial, with Meta, Amazon, Apple and a separate case against Google also heading for federal courtrooms.\n\nHeld in Washington, the trial was the first time the US Department of Justice has faced a big tech company in court since Microsoft was targeted more than two decades ago over the dominance of its Windows operating system.\n\nMehta presided over several months of testimony late last year that saw Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other top executives take the stand.\n\nAt the heart of the government's case was the massive payments made by Google to Apple and other companies to keep its world-leading search engine as the default on iPhones, web browsers and other products.\n\nCourt testimony revealed that these payments reach the tens of billions of dollars every year to keep its prime real estate on Apple hardware or the Safari and Mozilla browsers.\n\nThe Department of Justice lawyers argued that Google achieved and perpetuated its dominance -- and strangled rivals -- through these default deals that also expanded to Samsung and other device makers.\n\nMehta concluded, however, that Google's violation of the Sherman Act did not have \"anticompetitive effects.\"\n\ngc/bgs", "source": {"uri": "ccenterdispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Clay Center Dispatch On-Line"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The judge found Google's actions have stifled competition and innovation, and that the company's default search agreements with device manufacturers and browsers are a key factor in its market dominance.\n\nHere is a breakdown of what happened:\n\nThe case against Google\n\nThe ruling comes after a 10-week trial and is a major victory for the US Justice Department, which filed the lawsuit nearly four years ago. Google has announced plans to appeal the decision. The core accusation is that Google spent billions on exclusive deals to maintain its dominance in the search engine market, violating US antitrust laws.\n\nWhat are antitrust laws?\n\nAntitrust laws are regulations that promote fair competition by preventing monopolies, anti-competitive practices, and other activities that could harm consumers or other businesses.\n\nIn the United States, key laws include the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which prohibits monopolies and actions that restrain trade, and the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, which addresses specific unfair practices. The Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 established the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate and prevent unfair competition.\n\nThe FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) enforce these laws. They investigate companies and take action if they find any violations.\n\nThe DoJ's arguments\n\nThe DoJ argued that Google's agreements with wireless carriers, browser developers, and device manufacturers, especially Apple, were anti-competitive. In 2021, Google reportedly paid over $26 billion to companies like Apple to make its search engine the default option on devices like iPhones and browsers like Safari and Mozilla.\n\nGoogle's search-based advertising is a major revenue source, generating $175 billion in 2022. For comparison, Microsoft's Bing made about $12 billion.\n\nGoogle has an 89.2 per cent share of the market for general search services, increasing to 94.9 per cent on mobile devices.\n\nGoogle's defence\n\nGoogle argued its dominance was due to the quality of its search engine. They plan to appeal the decision, stating that while the ruling recognises their search engine's quality, it restricts their ability to make it readily available.\n\nDistrict Judge's verdict\n\nThe trial spanned several months, with testimonies from Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other top executives. Judge Amit Mehta's 277-page decision labelled Google a \"monopolist\" and highlighted the sheer volume of Google's search queries compared to rivals. Mehta noted that Google \"enjoys an 89.2% share of the market for general search services, which increases to 94.9% on mobile devices.\" He concluded that while Google violated antitrust laws, it did not have \"anticompetitive effects.\"\n\nThe judge acknowledged that while Google's search engine is widely recognised as the best available, its market share is significantly bolstered by these agreements. The judge pointed out that other search engines, like Microsoft's Bing, can capture significant market share when not overshadowed by Google's default status. For instance, Bing holds an 80% share of the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. He then ruled against the tech giant.\n\nUS Attorney General Merrick Garland called the decision an \"historic win for the American people,\" saying that no company is above the law.\n\nImplications\n\nFollowing the ruling, Google's parent company Alphabet's shares fell by 4.6%.\n\nThe court will now decide on the remedies Google must undertake. This could include restrictions on Google's ability to enter into exclusive deals.\n\nGoogle's president of global affairs, Kent Walker, said the company intends to appeal the decision.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nJonathan Kanter, head of the DoJ's antitrust division, believes the ruling will pave the way for innovation and protect access to information. Meanwhile, the Consumer Choice Centre, a lobbying group, criticised the decision as a step in the wrong direction.\n\nThe ruling is part of a broader crackdown on Big Tech. The DoJ has another pending case against Google related to digital advertising, and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed lawsuits against Amazon and Meta.", "source": {"uri": "ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sherman Antitrust Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_Antitrust_Act_of_1914", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice_Antitrust_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mozilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Kanter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Kanter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sundar Pichai"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/l3dququ_google-logo_625x300_06_August_24.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738?ver-20240615.100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

It was the first major tech antitrust lawsuit since U.S. v. Microsoft, a 1998 case that found Microsoft monopolized computer operating systems. The trial concluded in May.\n\n\"Google's dominance has gone unchallenged for well over a decade,\" wrote Judge Amit Mehta in his 277-page ruling Tuesday. \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly. It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.\"\n\nMehta said Google's exclusive agreements with companies like Apple have allowed it to hike prices for advertisers without any blowback. He wrote \"there is no evidence that any rival constrains Google's pricing decisions\" and that those unconstrained pricing decisions \"have fueled Google's dramatic revenue growth and allowed it to maintain high and remarkably stable operating profits.\" The judge noted that nearly 90% of all search queries went through Google in 2020.\n\nThe Google case has been likened to the U.S. v.

And what's next?\n\nThe DoJ, along with 11 states, filed a lawsuit against Google in October 2020. The primary accusation is that Google has used its dominance in the search engine market to unfairly protect its position and suppress competitors.\n\nWith Google controlling about 90% of the online search market and 95% on smartphones, the launch of the most significant antitrust case since the Microsoft trial in the late 1990s, was bound to come eventually, and the trial began in late 2023.\n\nOn August 5th 2024, US District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google acted illegally to maintain a monopoly on search and related advertising. In his ruling, Mehta wrote: \"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\"\n\nThe in-depth ruling covers a lot of ground, the crux of it being that Google has massively stifled competition in search through default agreements with the likes of Apple, and subsequent artificial price raises and contractual strong-arming. \"Once monopoly has been achieved and assuming significant entry barriers, the monopolist can set a profit-maximizing price without excessive concern about the behavior of other firms in the market.\" (discussing pricing power following price predation to drive out competitors). That is precisely how Google has approached its ad pricing... With less ad revenue, Google's rivals are limited in their ability to reinvest in quality improvements (both as to search and general search text ads) to attract more users and more ad dollars.\"\n\nThe ruling was heralded by US Attorney General Merrick Garland, the country's top prosecutor, as a \"historic win for the American people\". He continued: \"No company - no matter how large or influential - is above the law,\" Mr Garland said in a statement on Monday. \"The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nNo punishments have been meted out by the DoJ. Yet. 'Remedies' to the situation will be discussed in further court sessions, however the ruling is expected to have significant repercussions:\n\nAlphabet will, of course, appeal the result. In a company statement, Alphabet looked at the positives while biting back at the ruling: \"This decision recognises that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available.\"\n\nHowever, the robust ruling from Mehta raises questions as to the legal arguments Google could make to overturn the judgment. As he put simply, \"The fact that Google makes product changes without concern that its users might go elsewhere is something only a firm with monopoly power could do.\"\n\nIn short, more legal wranglings. After this ruling, Google are back in court against the DoJ on September 9th, facing charges relating to the company's ad stack. As per ExchangeWire's Mat Broughton: \"The DOJ's next case alleges that Google, via a host of acquisitions and subsequent manipulative self-preferencing actions, forced as many transactions as possible through its own ad tech stack, to the detriment of players across the entire digital advertising supply chain.\"\n\nMuch like the antirust search trial, the case will be tried by a single judge (US District Judge Leonie Brinkema) in a bench trial rather than by jury. Google managed to avoid a jury trial by paying USD$2.3m (\u00a31.8m), the maximum damages payable to the government.\n\nHowever, as Judge Mehta's ruling has shown, the lack of jury is no guarantee of success for Google; the DoJ are showing their teeth these days, and this week's ruling will ramp up the tension at the company heading towards the next case.

an approach that hurt consumers.\n\nGoogle responded that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting.\n\nFor instance, Yahoo - now a minor player on the internet - was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google.\n\nMr Mehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another phase to determine what types of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle parts of its internet empire or stop it paying more than $20 billion annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices.\n\nAfter the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@thenationalnews.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/ELVAKRJRUGFTAQMK7HA3D4QVHQ.jpg?smart=true&auth=f18ca39b98ce40b1b0ac543de735f0f0c2470fc83196accdf610380bb095caaa&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

an illegal monopoly.\n\nThis landmark decision holds Google accountable, DOJ antitrust Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter said this in a statement.\n\nIt said that it paves the path for innovation for generations to come and protects access to information for all Americans.\n\nKent Walker, Google's president of Global Affairs, said the company intended to appeal to Mehta's ruling.\n\nThis decision recognised that Google offered the best search engine, but concluded that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available, according to the statement.\n\n\"As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use.\"\n\nGoogle's fate will be decided in the next phase of proceedings, which could determine potential

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nIn a landmark legal decision, a federal judge has ruled that Google has violated antitrust laws by maintaining its monopoly power in the markets for general search services and general search text advertisements.\n\nThe ruling, issued on Aug. 5 by Judge Amit Mehta, concludes a lengthy legal battle initiated by the U.S. Department of Justice and a coalition of state attorneys general.\n\nThe case against Google, filed in October 2020, alleged that the tech giant engaged in anti-competitive practices by establishing exclusive agreements with browser developers, mobile device manufacturers, and wireless carriers, according to the ruling.\n\nThese agreements ensured that Google's search engine was the default option on most devices, effectively limiting consumer choice and stifling competition.\n\nThe court's findings indicate that Google is a monopolist in the relevant markets and has unlawfully used its dominant position to sustain its monopoly.\n\n\"The court has found that Plaintiffs have proven that Google has monopoly power in two relevant product markets: general search services and general search text advertising,\" the ruling stated.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.

While it was originally filed under President Donald Trump, Joe Biden has been stepping up efforts to rein in the power of Big Tech and the Google case was seen as a key test of this approach.\n\nThe ruling comes after a four-year legal battle during which the US Department of Justice argued that Google's domination of search was the result of freezing out potential rivals, rather than because it offered the best service.\n\nIt argued that billions of dollars in payments made to the likes of Apple, Samsung and others for prime placement on smartphones and web browsers violated antitrust laws.\n\n\"Most devices in the United States come preloaded exclusively with Google,\" Judge Mehta noted. \"These distribution deals have forced Google's rivals to find other ways to reach users.\"\n\nGoogle's lawyers argued during the case that this argument was \"deeply flawed\", claiming that people use its services by choice, not because they cannot find alternatives.\n\nThe legal battle marks the first US antitrust tech case since the government sued Microsoft in the 1990s over its domination of the personal computer market.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses this time around, saying Google's deals effectively blocked his company's Bing search engine.\n\nMr Nadella told the court: \"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google.

Its president of global affairs, Kent Walker, said \"this decision recognises that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available\".\n\nNevertheless, the landmark decision has shaken the foundation of Google's business, its search engine. For well over a decade, Google has been the dominant search engine in the market. The tech giant reportedly controls around 90% of the US online search market, leaving little room for competitors to make any claim.\n\nGoogle has been able to maintain this dominance through exclusive contracts with companies such as Apple and Samsung, which enable Google to be the default search engine on their platforms.\n\nThese monopolistic practices have allowed Google to charge high prices for search advertising. Being the default browser across many platforms, this search engine has become the easiest, quickest and most reliable resource for most people. This has reinforced the company's online advertising business, leaving little room for competitors to offer comparable services at more reasonable prices.\n\nA separate proceeding will be held to determine what penalties Google and its parent company, Alphabet, will face. However, it is likely the tech giant will be hit with both monetary penalties and enforced mitigations aimed at reducing its dominance.\n\nHistorically, fines have not been the sole method of enforcing antitrust laws as they do not demonstrate long-term impacts. This is especially true for a multi-trillion-dollar organisation such as Google.\n\nSome of the mitigations which may be imposed include the implementation of a \"choice screen\". This would allow users to pick between other available search engines, instead of having Google as the default option.\n\nThis is not the first time Google has been found guilty of breaching antitrust laws. Over the past decade it has been fined a total of \u20ac8.25 billion (A$13.6 billion) by the European Union for three separate breaches of the union's antitrust laws.\n\nAntitrust laws are enforced at domestic levels, and breaches of these laws are specific to domestic markets. This is why Google is facing these charges across two different continents.\n\nGoogle has continued to appeal the EU fines over the years. Walker has already confirmed that the company will appeal the US decision.\n\nAntitrust laws are designed to enhance competition. They exist to protect consumers by prohibiting business practices that promote unfair monopolies, suppress competition and enforce dominance or power.\n\nThe dominance that Google has held over other search engines has created a concentrated market that has prevented smaller competitors from operating equitably.\n\nThis is why Google can charge high advertising prices, because there is slim competition in terms of visibility.\n\nThe recent US ruling, alongside the EU rulings, may be the first steps towards opening the tech market up to other competitors. In turn, this may promote more equitable competition, which would be a win for consumers.\n\nCompetition fuels incentives for innovation. When there is only one option available, as often seems to be the case with search engines, this incentive is suffocated under the dominance of one monopolistic player.\n\nWhile antitrust laws are only enforced at domestic levels, hopefully the outcomes of the EU and US rulings will have flow-on effects that extend beyond these markets.\n\nDuring the trial, some concerns were raised around how Google's monopolised position as the default search engine has unfairly benefited it in the artificial intelligence (AI) race.\n\nThe default agreements and terms of conditions of the Google search engine has enabled the organisation to access enormous amounts of user search data, which can be used to train AI models. The easy access to this data may act as a gateway for Google to establish a position of dominance in AI.\n\nDismantling Google as the default search engine on platforms such as Apple and Samsung could shift Google's position in the race for AI supremacy.\n\nAs such, it may also shift the future trajectory of the entire internet.\n\nZena Assaad does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conversation_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Conversation (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_National_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian National University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Continent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 61}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The government said Google has paid Apple, Samsung Electronics and others billions of dollars over decades for prime placement on smartphones and web browsers. This default position has allowed Google to build up the most-used search engine in the world, and fuelled more than $US300 billion in annual revenue largely generated by search ads.\n\nJudge Mehta found that Google doesn't have a monopoly in the market for general search advertising, noting that competitors like Amazon.com, Walmart and other retailers have begun to offer advertising related to searches on their own websites. But Google does have a monopoly over search text ads, which appear at the top of a search results page to draw users to websites, he said.\n\nThe judge's decision focuses solely on Google's liability, nine months after the Justice Department and a group of states held a 10-week trial in federal court. He plans to hold a separate trial on what remedy to impose at a later date.\n\nThe Justice Department hasn't yet said what changes it will seek, though it presented evidence that efforts by European regulators to require Google to offer users a choice of search engines led few to switch. The agency could demand the separation of Alphabet's search business from other products, like Android or Chrome, which would mark the biggest forced breakup of a US company since AT&T was dismantled in 1984.\n\nAntitrust enforcers separately sued Google for allegedly monopolising the technology used to buy, sell and serve display advertising online.

The court trial took place in September last year and went on for around ten weeks.\n\n\"[...] Google has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by maintaining its monopoly in two product markets in the United States - general search services and general text advertising - through its exclusive distribution agreements,\" Judge Mehta wrote.\n\nHere are the important highlights of the monumental antitrust judgment spanning roughly 286 pages.\n\nGoogle's monopoly power in the online search market\n\nAccording to the judgment, the plaintiffs said that Google controls a dominant and durable share of the search market, adding that its position is protected by high barriers of entry. In response, Google argued that it did not have monopoly in the broader market of query responses as there is vigorous competition in that space.\n\nHowever, the court rejected Google's arguments and recognised the existence of a market comprising general search engines (GSEs).\n\nNotably, the court found that Google has monopoly power within this market.\n\n\"Measured by query volume, Google enjoys an 89.2% share of the market for general search services, which increases to 94.9% on mobile devices. This overwhelms Bing's\n\nshare of 5.5% on all queries and 1.3% on mobile, as well as Yahoo's and DDG's shares, which are under 3% regardless of device type. Google does not contest these figures,\" the order read.\n\n\"Google has enjoyed an over-80% share since at least 2009. That is a durable dominant share by any measure,\" it added. It also said that Google's \"near-complete\" control of key distribution channels was a major barrier of entry for other search companies, adding that \"the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has not sufficiently eroded barriers to entry -- at least not yet.\"\n\nGoogle's monopoly of text-based ads on search\n\nText ads have the appearance of organic search results and provide web links to the\n\nadvertiser's site. They can include an image but are largely text-based, as per the order.\n\nThe court found that Google controls a large and durable share of the text ads market. \"In 2020, its market share in the text ads market was 88%, having grown steadily from 80% in 2016,\" it said.\n\nThis monopoly is further protected by significant;y high entry barriers as only search engines can display text ads. \"New entrants face the same major obstacles as would the developer of a new GSE,\" the order read.\n\n\"That Google makes changes to its text ads auctions without considering its rivals' prices is something that only a firm with monopoly power is able to do,\" it further said.\n\nHowever, the court did not recognise a separate market for search ads and further ruled that Google did not have monopoly power in that market. It based this decision on the lack of direct or indirect evidence presented by the plaintiffs.\n\nGoogle abused its monopoly position\n\nGoogle did not violate the Sherman Act by just having a monopoly in the two markets. Instead, the court found that it had indulged in behaviour that blocked out other search engines and search text ad companies.\n\nThe court held that having Google Search as the preloaded, default search engine on all Apple and Android devices causes anticompetitive harm. It also said that Google has locked up 90 per cent of the online search market by striking deals with Apple as well as Samsung and Verizon to be the default search engine on their respective handsets and mobile carriers.\n\n\"Google understands there is no genuine competition for the defaults because it knows that its partners cannot afford to go elsewhere. Time and again, Google's partners have concluded that it is financially infeasible to switch default GSEs or seek greater flexibility in search offerings because it would mean sacrificing the hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars that Google pays them as revenue share,\" the judgment read.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "karan_mahadik@indianexpress.com", "name": "Karan Mahadik", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sherman Antitrust Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barriers_to_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barriers to entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Verizon Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_network_operator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile network operator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Internet_Marketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Internet Marketing", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Employment", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Information_Retrieval", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Information Retrieval", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/08/Tech-feature-images8.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

It currently holds 90% of the online search market, Reuters reported, and 95% on smartphones.\n\nRival search engines like Microsoft's Bing couldn't compete, prosecutors argued. Google insisted at the trial that the reason why it was the default wasn't to do with the billions of dollars it spent, but because its products are just better.\n\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote in his opinion.\n\nThis is the US Department of Justice's biggest victory against a tech company, and was widely seen as a test of whether antitrust laws enacted in the 19th century could stand up to Big Tech.\n\nThe ruling will change how users find information online. Much of the web is produced in such a way as to make it easy to find on Google Search, and that organizing principle could change or even disappear. More users could also choose to use alternative search engines that offer different results with varying levels of quality, creating an even more splintered information environment.\n\nIt could also have far-reaching implications for how consumer technology, such as phones and laptops, behave when users first turn them on. Apple products, for example, default to Google Search in the Safari browser -- it's possible Apple will need to let users choose a search engine during device setup as a default, instead.\n\nAnd Google itself could be forced to change: It is possible that Judge Mehta will decide to try and break Google's sprawling business up. A future hearing will determine what remedies Google will have to make.\n\nThe ruling could also have implications for antitrust lawsuits filed against other tech companies, including Apple (over its smartphone business), Meta (for buying out competitors), and Amazon (for its third-party seller policies), The New York Times noted.

The bulk of the case played out in a ten-day trial in a Washington, DC District Court last fall, involving many other big tech companies in Google's orbit -- including Apple.\n\nOne of the core elements of the case was whether Apple's lucrative search deal with Google was an example of anti-competitive behavior. Google pays Apple around $20 billion per year for a default spot on what is arguably the most valuable piece of digital real estate on the planet -- the iPhone's Safari browser -- and rivals have been vying over it for years.\n\nFor its part, Apple has always maintained that Google is simply the best option for its customers -- at least, that's what Apple SVP Eddy Cue told the court last fall. However, that deal also gives Apple 36 percent of Google's ad revenue from searches performed in Safari, which is why Google strongly prefers that folks use Chrome on the iPhone.\n\nIn that sense, an argument could be made that the Google-Apple deal isn't anticompetitive, as the alternative would leave Google with 100% of its search revenue. However, the flip side of that argument is that Google wins either way -- it merely benefits less from folks who use Safari. Further, the deal was exclusive, and part of the case against Google is that it had paid out billions of dollars to Apple and other firms to ensure that it constantly had default or at least prominent placement.\n\nIn weighing the balances on all sides, Judge Mehta was clear that Google's behavior meets the standard of a monopoly under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, the key legislation that's used to measure such things.\n\nAfter having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\n\nIn the ruling, Judge Mehta also noted that one of the things that allowed Google to maintain its monopoly was the staggering barrier to entry, citing one testimony that \"it would cost Apple billions to compete in the search market\" even before it made the necessary \"multi-billion-dollar investment needed to build and maintain an ad platform or other means of monetization.\"\n\nThis means that only the tech companies with the deepest pockets could even consider competing with Google. However, to discourage them from doing so, the search giant offered them such substantially large buckets of money that they became dependent on the additional revenue stream.\n\nGoogle understands there is no genuine competition for the default because it knows that its partners cannot afford to go elsewhere. Time and again, Google's partners have concluded that it is financially infeasible to switch default GSEs or seek greater flexibility in search offers because it would mean sacrificing the hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars that Google pays them as revenue share.\n\nAs Apple's senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue was the lead negotiator for the contract. While Cue maintained during his testimony that Apple always felt Google was the best option for customers, he described the difficulties he experienced getting Google CEO Sundar Pichai to agree to a higher revenue share when the two companies negotiated to renew the deal in 2016. However, Cue also said the two sides ultimately came up with a percentage somewhere in the middle, which is how negotiations typically work. The terms were renewed in 2021, suggesting that both companies still considered them favorable.\n\nStill, it's not just Apple; the ruling adds Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile as other companies that \"sought and failed to obtain greater flexibility under the relevant contracts.\"\n\nThese are Fortune 500 companies, and they have nowhere else to turn other than Google.\n\nWhile Apple could certainly survive the shortfall of losing the Google search deal, it still comprises a substantial portion of its revenue. Last week, Apple reported $24.21 billion in services revenue for the most recent fiscal quarter. Assuming that Google's 36 percent revenue sharing still works out to around $20 billion per year, it would make up approximately 20% of Apple's overall services revenue and just under 6% of its total revenue.\n\nAlthough the ruling has established Google as a monopoly, it's merely an initial finding that doesn't discuss any potential remedies. This means there's no way of knowing yet what this could ultimately mean for the future of the Apple-Google search deal, some of which may be contingent on how the separate DOJ lawsuit against Apple plays out.", "source": {"uri": "idropnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "iDrop News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_Cue", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eddy Cue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google Chrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sherman Antitrust Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_sharing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revenue sharing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sundar Pichai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Verizon Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AT&T"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fortune 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://cdn.idropnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/15114126/Google-Company-Logo--800x480.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Judge Amit P. Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found on Monday that Google had violated antitrust laws by stifling rivals in internet search to protect its monopoly.\n\nGoogle's loss could have major ripple effects for competition today. U.S. regulators have also accused Apple, Amazon and Meta of violating antitrust laws by advantaging their own products on the platforms they run and acquiring smaller rivals. The Google ruling, and potential remedies to be decided by Mehta, are likely to weigh heavily on those cases, including a second lawsuit against Google over ad technology, which is scheduled to go to trial next month.\n\nMehta's ruling is \"a predictor of what other courts might do,\" said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a Vanderbilt University law professor who studies antitrust. \"You can also expect other judges to read this opinion and be influenced by it.\"\n\nThe influence of the Microsoft antitrust case was, in fact, apparent in the Google decision. In Mehta's 277-page judgment, Microsoft appeared on 104 pages, both as an aspiring rival to Google and as a legal precedent. Google has said it will appeal the ruling.\n\nAfter years of little enforcement, antitrust activism has taken off over the past few years, first under the Trump administration and then under President Joe Biden's. The heads of antitrust enforcement at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, Jonathan Kanter and Lina Khan, have sued the other tech giants over allegations that they are monopolies engaged in illegal corporate behavior.\n\nAll of those cases hinge on the 19th-century Sherman Antitrust Act, which makes it illegal for a monopoly to engage in corporate conduct to thwart competition. But that law, designed for companies like Standard Oil, faces the continuing challenge of being applied in a different industrial environment to the new technology of its day. And both agencies have sought to test the old law by applying new legal arguments when it comes to the tech giants.\n\nWithout major cases, \"the law will stagnate,\" Kanter said in a speech in 2022. \"Congress designed antitrust law to play out in the courts.\"\n\nIn the 1990s, Microsoft was the ruling digital platform, with its Windows software controlling the experience of users on more than 90% of personal computers. Today, Google has a comparable grip on internet search.\n\nThat changed for Microsoft after a judge ruled it was a monopoly. Regulators had brought the suit after the software giant waged a campaign to try to crush an upstart, Netscape, the pioneering commercial browser company. Microsoft bullied PC makers with contracts that effectively stopped them from offering the Netscape browser. Ultimately, Microsoft was prohibited from restricting, in its contracts, the freedom of PC makers to offer other software, and was forced to open up some of its technology. The time, money and management attention spent, as well as the adverse public scrutiny, some antitrust experts say, did have a deterrent effect, moderating the company's behavior.\n\nThat prevented Microsoft from controlling the development of the internet, said Fiona Scott Morton, an economics professor at the Yale University School of Management.\n\n\"The goal is to open a path for future innovation,\" she said.\n\nOn Monday, Mehta found that Google had broken the law through its exclusive deals with Apple, other device makers and browser companies to make Google's search engine the automatic selection.\n\nMehta praised the company for its engineering skill and investment in search. \"But Google,\" he wrote, \"has a major, largely unseen advantage over its rivals: default distribution.\"\n\nThe Google ruling is significant because \"it applies to big tech platforms the notion that while you can be dominant, you can't abuse that dominance,\" said Bill Baer, a former top antitrust official in the Justice Department.\n\nUnlike Microsoft, Google is a pure internet company with a very different business model, relying mainly on advertising rather than software licensing.\n\nIn the Google case, as in Microsoft's, the court found that contracts illegally excluded rivals. But Google's were more carrot than stick, offering industry partners generous payments rather than threats. Google paid smartphone companies and browser makers more than $26 billion in 2021, according to court testimony, to set its software to automatically handle all search queries.\n\nIn the Google case, data was described as a vital asset. The more user queries that flow through a search engine, the more data that is collected and then harnessed to improve search results, attracting still more users and generating more data.\n\n\"At every stage of the search process,\" Mehta wrote, \"user data is a critical input that directly improves quality.\"\n\nGoogle's multibillion-dollar default deals ensured that the company had a huge data advantage in search, the government claimed. It also presented studies in behavioral economics that concluded people rarely switched from the automatic settings, even if doing so was not a daunting technical task. Consumer behavior was not forced but strongly steered by the power of defaults.\n\nIn his ruling, Mehta pointed to \"the power of defaults.\" He cited and agreed with an expert witness for the government, Antonio Rangel, a professor of neuroscience, behavioral biology and economics at Caltech, who testified that the \"vast majority\" of searches were done by habit.\n\nIn court, Google countered that its search engine was the leader because it was a superior product; that data was important but clever software was its real advantage; and that its contracts were deals freely entered into by its industry partners.\n\nBut Google struggled to credibly explain why it paid so much to get preferred distribution if its search software was clearly the best technology. Those payments made sense, the government insisted, to ensure that Google was the winner, with its monopoly entrenched.\n\n\"That's how the government told the story, and it's a pretty convincing story,\" said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert at the University of Pennsylvania's Carey Law School.\n\nMehta will now decide what remedial steps he should order to open the search market to greater competition and new innovators.\n\nEven before his ruling, antitrust experts offered a flurry of recommendations. They run the gamut from prohibiting Google from striking exclusive deals for search distribution and sharing its search data with competitors to splitting off Google's Chrome browser or its Android mobile operating system.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Kanter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Kanter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lina_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lina Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States v.

Circuit.\n\nShares of Google parent Alphabet fell 4.3% on Monday as part of a broad tech share decline.\n\nMehta noted that Google had paid $26.3 billion in 2021 alone to ensure that its search engine is the default on smartphones and browsers, and to keep its dominant market share.\n\n\"The default is extremely valuable real estate... Even if a new entrant were positioned from a quality standpoint to bid for the default when an agreement expires, such a firm could compete only if it were prepared to pay partners upwards of billions of dollars in revenue share and make them whole for any revenue shortfalls resulting from the change,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nHe noted \"Google, of course, recognizes that losing defaults would dramatically impact its bottom line. For instance, Google has projected that losing the Safari default would result in a significant drop in queries and billions of dollars in lost revenues.\"\n\nThe ruling is the first major decision in a series of cases taking on alleged monopolies in Big Tech.\n\n\"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, who noted a drawn out legal process will delay any immediate effects for consumers.\n\nIn the past four years, federal antitrust regulators have also sued Meta Platforms, Amazon.com, and Apple Inc, claiming the companies have illegally maintained monopolies. Another case against Google over its advertising technology is scheduled to go to trial in September.\n\nWhen it was filed in 2020, the Google search case was the first time in a generation that the U.S. government accused a major corporation of an illegal monopoly. Microsoft settled with the Justice Department in 2004 over claims that it forced its Internet Explorer web browser on Windows users.\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson, Mike Scarcella and Chris Sanders in Washington; additional reporting by Arsheeya Singh Bajwa; editing by Peter Henderson)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@theprint.in", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_District_of_Columbia_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet Explorer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/theprint_default_image_new.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Being the default browser across many platforms, this search engine has become the easiest, quickest and most reliable resource for most people. This has reinforced the company's online advertising business, leaving little room for competitors to offer comparable services at more reasonable prices.\n\nWhat does this mean for Google?\n\nA separate proceeding will be held to determine what penalties Google and its parent company, Alphabet, will face. However, it is likely the tech giant will be hit with both monetary penalties and enforced mitigations aimed at reducing its dominance.\n\nHistorically, fines have not been the sole method of enforcing antitrust laws as they do not demonstrate long-term impacts. This is especially true for a multi-trillion-dollar organisation such as Google.\n\nSome of the mitigations which may be imposed include the implementation of a \"choice screen\". This would allow users to pick between other available search engines, instead of having Google as the default option.\n\nThis is not the first time Google has been found guilty of breaching antitrust laws. Over the past decade it has been fined a total of \u20ac8.25 billion (A$13.6 billion) by the European Union for three separate breaches of the union's antitrust laws.\n\nAntitrust laws are enforced at domestic levels, and breaches of these laws are specific to domestic markets. This is why Google is facing these charges across two different continents.\n\nGoogle has continued to appeal the EU fines over the years. Walker has already confirmed that the company will appeal the US decision.\n\nWhat does this mean for internet users?\n\nAntitrust laws are designed to enhance competition. They exist to protect consumers by prohibiting business practices that promote unfair monopolies, suppress competition and enforce dominance or power.\n\nThe dominance that Google has held over other search engines has created a concentrated market that has prevented smaller competitors from operating equitably.\n\nThis is why Google can charge high advertising prices, because there is slim competition in terms of visibility.\n\nThe recent US ruling, alongside the EU rulings, may be the first steps towards opening the tech market up to other competitors. In turn, this may promote more equitable competition, which would be a win for consumers.\n\nCompetition fuels incentives for innovation. When there is only one option available, as often seems to be the case with search engines, this incentive is suffocated under the dominance of one monopolistic player.\n\nWhile antitrust laws are only enforced at domestic levels, hopefully the outcomes of the EU and US rulings will have flow-on effects that extend beyond these markets.\n\nWhat does this mean for the race for AI supremacy?\n\nDuring the trial, some concerns were raised around how Google's monopolised position as the default search engine has unfairly benefited it in the artificial intelligence (AI) race.\n\nThe default agreements and terms of conditions of the Google search engine has enabled the organisation to access enormous amounts of user search data, which can be used to train AI models. The easy access to this data may act as a gateway for Google to establish a position of dominance in AI.\n\nDismantling Google as the default search engine on platforms such as Apple and Samsung could shift Google's position in the race for AI supremacy.\n\nAs such, it may also shift the future trajectory of the entire internet.\n\nZena Assaad does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.\n\n/Courtesy of The Conversation.

According to Judge Amit Metha and after a ten-week trial, Google has been ruled to be in breach of Section 2 of the Sherman Act.\n\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" the ruling states.\n\nThe ruling means the court agrees with the DOJ's accusation of Google acting as an illegal monopoly in the search market as well as in online advertising. However, the ruling only determines Google's liability, and not any fines or other restitution.\n\nThis is not the only DOJ lawsuit Google faces in 2024. Starting September 9th, it will be facing another trial, covering the advertising technology side of its empire.\n\nGoogle has yet to comment on the court's ruling.\n\nThe lawsuit from the DOJ argued that Google maintained a monopoly by paying billions of dollars to firms, so it was the most prominent or first choice for consumers.\n\nApple was the recipient of some of the payments, with the iPhone maker handed $20 billion from Google in 2022. The payment was to maintain its default search engine status.\n\nAs part of proceedings, a trio of Apple executives were subpoenaed for testimony, which Apple failed to quash. SVP of Services Eddy Cue, SVP of Machine Learning and AI Strategy John Giannandrea, and VP of Corporate Development Adrian Perica were all called upon to give evidence.\n\nThe $20 million figure was actually disclosed by Eddy Cue during the trial, and came to light following an unsealing of testimonies.\n\nDuring the trial, it was also revealed that Microsoft tried to make Bing the default search engine for Safari, by offering Apple 90% of its advertising revenue. Microsoft also offered to sell Bing to Apple in 2020.\n\nThe regular billion-dollar payments from Google to Apple may be lucrative for the latter, but it may not necessarily continue. In July, Google was reportedly keen to lessen its dependence on Apple for search traffic and revenue.\n\nApple's payment from Google represented a 36% cut of Google's ad revenue from searches performed through Safari on iPhone.\n\nFollowing the DOJ's win in the lawsuit, this now means the annual payment itself could be at risk. With the potential for Judge Mehta to order for Google to be broken up, it's even more probable that the gravy train will come to an abrupt stop.\n\nRead on AppleInsider", "source": {"uri": "forums.appleinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AppleInsider Forums"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sherman Antitrust Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Empire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_Cue", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eddy Cue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Giannandrea", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Giannandrea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/60607-124720-56177-114033-IMG_3127-xl-xl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-09", "textStart": 828, "textEnd": 841}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nGoogle almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may land in the U..S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out more than $20 billion annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki",

The company has invested billions of dollars in exclusive contracts to ensure its position as the default search engine on smartphones and web browsers worldwide. These contracts have effectively excluded rivals like Microsoft's Bing and DuckDuckGo.\n\nJudge Mehta specifically highlighted Google's exclusive deals with Apple and other key players in the mobile ecosystem as anti-competitive. Additionally, the court noted that Google's pricing in search advertising reflects its monopolistic control. Although the ruling did not declare Google a monopoly in search ads, it represents a major victory in the U.S. government's broader legal campaign against Big Tech companies.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland lauded the decision, stating that \"no company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law.\"\n\nThe White House also hailed the ruling as a victory for consumers, with Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre emphasising the need for an open and competitive internet.\n\nThe ruling sets the stage for a separate proceeding to determine the penalties Google will face. Possible consequences could include the introduction of a \"choice screen\" to inform users about alternative search engines, as suggested by Rebecca Allensworth, a law professor at Vanderbilt University. The company may also face monetary fines, though these are not typically the primary enforcement mechanism in U.S. antitrust cases. In extreme cases, officials have not ruled out the possibility of breaking up Google to restore competitive balance.\n\nThis landmark decision against Google is reminiscent of historical antitrust cases, such as the breakups of AT&T and Standard Oil, and Microsoft's illegal bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows. Diana Moss, vice president at the Progressive Policy Institute, pointed out that the case underscores the unlawful use of exclusive contracts by monopolistic firms.\n\nHowever, not everyone agrees with the court's decision. Adam Kovacevich, founder of the tech advocacy group Chamber of Progress and a former Google policy director, argued that the ruling benefits Microsoft more than consumers. He suggested that forcing Bing into default deals would undermine consumer choice, as many prefer Google for its perceived quality.\n\nThe decision's impact extends beyond Google's search engine users. It may influence business practices across the economy, as companies reassess the legality of their contracts in light of this ruling. Furthermore, the case could set a precedent for other antitrust actions against major tech firms, including Apple and Amazon.\n\nThe trial's outcome may also have significant implications for the future of artificial intelligence (AI). Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella testified that Google's dominance in search data, bolstered by its default agreements, could give it an unassailable advantage in AI development. This concern highlights the broader stakes of the case, as AI-powered search alternatives like OpenAI's ChatGPT pose new competitive threats to Google's market position.", "source": {"uri":

For example, the judge notes Google adjusted ad pricing to maintain a specific growth target, and increased it incrementally to mask it in the typical fluctuations of ad costs. He also cites a finding that \"thirteen months of user data acquired by Google is equivalent to over 17 years of data on Bing\" in informing the quality of search results. Meanwhile, Google pays Apple a redacted amount through its revenue sharing agreement for default placement in Safari, and it pays for searches performed through Chrome on Apple devices as well. There is a lot more in here, and I fully intend on re-reading the opinion with a bunch of questions I have in mind.\n\nGoogle really does have great search results a lot of the time, even though it has stumbled in recent years. DuckDuckGo is my default but I find myself often turning to Google for local results, very old results, and news. (DuckDuckGo is powered by Bing, which prioritizes MSN-syndicated versions of articles that I do not want.) Google has not fallen into the same trap as Bing by wholly cluttering the results page. Microsoft still has no taste.\n\nBut two things can be true: Google can be the best search engine for most people, most of the time, because it is very good; and, also, Google can have abused its market-leading position to avoid competition and maintain its advertising revenue. Those are not inconsistent with each other. In fact, per the judge's citation of how long it would take for Bing to amass the same information about user activity as Google does in a year, it is fully possible its quality and its dominance are related, something the judge nods toward. In fact, Google's position is now so entrenched \"it would not lose search revenue if were to significantly reduce the quality of its search product\".\n\nNotably, Mehta did not sanction Google for failing to preserve evidence in the case, writing:\n\nOn the request for sanctions, the court declines to impose them. Not because Google's failure to preserve chat messages might not warrant them. But because the sanctions Plaintiffs request do not move the needle on the court's assessment of Google's liability.

A follow-up trial may result in extreme measures, such as the dissolution of Alphabet, Google's parent company, fundamentally changing the internet advertising market that Google has dominated for years.\n\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Judge Mehta wrote. With a stunning $26.3 billion spent in 2021 alone to guarantee its search engine remained the default option on the majority of smartphones and web browsers, the Mountain View, California-based tech giant controls about 90% of the internet search market and 95% of searches on smartphones.\n\n\"The default is extremely valuable real estate,\" Mehta noted, emphasizing that any competitor trying to displace Google would have to be ready to spend billions.\n\nAlphabet shares fell 4.5% on Monday, amid major falls in the technology industry. If Alphabet loses its default position, Google's advertising income, which accounted for 77% of its total sales in 2023, may be seriously jeopardized.

This decision marks a significant victory for federal authorities challenging the market dominance of Big Tech.Thank you for reading this post, don't forget to subscribe!\n\nThe ruling sets the stage for a second trial focused on potential remedies, which could include breaking up Google's parent company, Alphabet. Such an outcome would dramatically reshape the online advertising landscape that Google has controlled for years.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta noted that Google controls about 90% of the online search market and 95% on smartphones, describing the company as a monopolist that has acted to preserve its dominance.\n\nThe next phase of legal proceedings, which could extend into 2026 due to appeals, will determine the measures needed to address Google's anti-competitive practices. Alphabet's shares dropped 4.5% on Monday amid a broader decline in tech stocks.\n\nMassive Payments for Market Dominance\n\nJudge Mehta highlighted that Google paid $26.3 billion in 2021 to ensure its search engine remained the default on smartphones and web browsers. He emphasized that controlling these default positions is \"extremely valuable real estate\" that new market entrants could only challenge by matching Google's enormous financial commitments.\n\nAlphabet plans to appeal the decision, arguing that it reflects the strength of Google's search engine rather than anti-competitive behavior. However, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland and the White House praised the ruling as a significant victory for fair competition.\n\nBroader Implications for Big Tech\n\nThe ruling is the first major decision in a series of federal cases targeting alleged monopolies in the technology sector. In addition to Google, federal regulators have filed similar cases against Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Apple, all initiated under the Trump administration.\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, underscored the bipartisan support for these actions, describing Google as a \"rampant monopolist.\" The case against Google, filed in 2020, represents the most significant government antitrust challenge since the Microsoft case in the early 2000s.", "source": {"uri": "naija247news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Naija247news"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Klobuchar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amy Klobuchar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://naija247news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/1ae220c2657b1e9a85c390c2b0244457.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 12, "textEnd": 17}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Mehta submitted the ruling, rebuking one of Google's oldest businesses that the company has spent billions on through exclusive contracts in order to obtain a dominant position within the tech industry, according to CNN. Mehta stated Google not only acted as a \"monopolist,\" but abused a \"monopoly\" through their search business to be the automatic search engine for browsers such as Apple's Safari and Mozilla's Firefox.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" US District Judge Amit Mehta Mehta wrote. \"It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.\"\n\nLast January, the Department of Justice (DOJ), along with a handful of other state attorneys general, sued the tech company for \"monopolizing multiple digital advertising technology products\" which they claimed violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, according to a press release.\n\n\"Today's complaint alleges that Google has used anticompetitive, exclusionary, and unlawful conduct to eliminate or severely diminish any threat to its dominance over digital advertising technologies,\" Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said at the time.\n\nOver the years, Google has reportedly spent billions to keep their automatic search engine on specific browsers, paying Apple roughly $18 billion in 2021 to be the default search engine, The New York Times reported.\n\nDuring the trial, Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, claimed that the company created a better service for consumers, according to the NYT. Microsoft's chief executive, Satya Nadella, called out the company for creating an \"oligopolistic\" relationship with Apple.\n\nIn addition to its search business, the DOJ claimed Google had a protected monopoly of its ads that were run within the search engine, the NYT reported. Lawyers for the DOJ called out the tech company for raising ad prices beyond a reasonable rate within the free market, thus allegedly providing evidence of Google's power as billions were consumed from ads.\n\nWhile the case is the first in over 20 years for an antitrust trial between the DOJ and a tech company, the ruling has the ability to affect other similar lawsuits against Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta - the owner of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, according to the NYT.\n\nAlthough Mehta did not give a solution to Google's behavior, the judge is expected to decide the ramifications for the company soon.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

case", "body": "Several months of testimony saw Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other top executives take the stand - Copyright GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA/AFP JUSTIN SULLIVAN\n\nA US judge on Monday handed Google a major legal blow, ruling in a closely-watched anti-trust case that it has a monopoly with its dominant search engine.\n\nThe landmark decision against a \"big tech\" giant could alter how the sector operates in future.\n\nDistrict Court Judge Amit Mehta found that Google maintained a monopoly for search and for text ads through exclusive distribution agreements that made it the \"default\" option that people were likely to use on devices.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote in his ruling.\n\nThe internet behemoth \"has a major, largely unseen advantage over its rivals: default distribution,\" he added.\n\nThe anti-trust trial pitting US prosecutors against Google ended in May with a two-day hearing.\n\nThe case was the first of five major lawsuits by the US government to reach trial, with Meta, Amazon, Apple and a separate case against Google also heading for federal courtrooms.\n\nHeld in Washington, the trial was the first time the US Department of Justice has faced a big tech company in court since Microsoft was targeted more than two decades ago over the dominance of its Windows operating system.\n\nMehta presided over several months of testimony late last year that saw Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other top executives take the stand.\n\nAt the heart of the government's case was the massive payments made by Google to Apple and other companies to keep its world-leading search engine as the default on iPhones, web browsers and other products.\n\nCourt testimony revealed that these payments reach the tens of billions of dollars every year to keep its prime real estate on Apple hardware or the Safari and Mozilla browsers.\n\nThe Department of Justice lawyers argued that Google achieved and perpetuated its dominance -- and strangled rivals -- through these default deals that also expanded to Samsung and other device makers.\n\nMehta concluded, however, that Google's violation of the Sherman Act did not have \"anticompetitive effects.\"",

The judge has yet to announce what changes it will seek, but we might see Google offering Android users in the US the option to pick a search engine when setting up a new device.\n\nOther decisions might include separating the search business from Alphabet's other products, like Android or Chrome; if that is ordered, we might see the biggest forced breakup of a US company since AT&T was dismantled in 1984 and ordered to sell some of its business to smaller independent regional phone companies.\n\nThe full report revealed that Google systematically paid Samsung and Apple to use its search engine, which drove the company's value to the sky and brought in more than $300 billion in revenue, largely generated by ads within the search engine. This also affected the market share, as Google held 80% in 2009 but grew to 90% in 2020.\n\nGoogle said it will appeal the decision, arguing that its success is based on people preferring its \"superior products.\"", "source": {"uri": "gsmarena.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GSM Arena"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the District of Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walmart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AT&T"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google Chrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Internet_Marketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Internet Marketing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://fdn.gsmarena.com/imgroot/news/23/01/google-services-in-eu-more-transparency/-728x314/gsmarena_000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

While the dust is far from settling on this decision, it isn't just a pivotal legal defeat for Google but a necessary step towards preserving competition, innovation, and consumer choice in the digital age.\n\nFor years, Google has been synonymous with search. Its name has become a verb -- and that should have been the determining factor in itself in this case. When we say the word \"Google,\" what we are really doing is reflecting on the brand's dominance and ubiquity.\n\nBut as today's decision reflects, this dominance didn't come about purely through superior technology or innovation. Instead, Google has systematically secured its position by spending tens of billions of dollars on exclusive contracts with smartphone manufacturers and web browser designers, ensuring that its search engine remains the default option for most users. This strategy has stifled/killed/scared away competition and cemented Google's monopoly, making it nearly impossible for other search engines to even dream of gaining a foothold.\n\nThe court's decision to recognize Google as a monopoly is a validation of the concerns raised by many in the industry and among regulators.\n\nGoogle's aggressive pursuit of exclusivity deals has created significant barriers to entry for other search engines. By locking in agreements with companies like Apple, Samsung, and Mozilla, Google has ensured that its search engine is the default choice on billions of devices worldwide. This isn't just smart business; it's a strategy designed to stifle competition. Users rarely change default settings, meaning rival search engines struggle to attract even a fraction of Google's user base. This lack of competition limits consumer choice and innovation within the search market.\n\n2. Google Controls Data\n\nGoogle's dominance extends beyond search; it controls a vast ecosystem of services that collect and leverage user data. This data supremacy gives Google an unparalleled advantage in refining its search algorithms and targeting ads. Competitors, without access to similar volumes of data, can't match Google's performance, further entrenching its market position. This control over data not only reinforces Google's monopoly but also raises significant privacy concerns that Google has done far too little to address over the years.\n\n3. Google Intentionally Impacts the Advertising Market\n\nGoogle's monopoly in search directly impacts the online advertising market. With its control over search, Google can dictate terms to advertisers, leading to higher ad prices and less room for negotiation. Smaller businesses and advertisers find themselves at the mercy of Google's policies and pricing, which can stifle their growth and limit their reach. No other company has even a small fraction of this impact -- which is a great way to measure what is, in a practical sense, a monopoly. By breaking Google's monopoly, the court's decision could pave the way for a more competitive and fair advertising landscape.\n\n4. Google Suppresses Innovation\n\nI'm really on the fence on this one, but I'll first give the party line here.\n\nMonopolies tend to become complacent, prioritizing the protection of their market position over innovation. While Google has undoubtedly introduced groundbreaking technologies, its focus has increasingly shifted toward maintaining its dominance rather than fostering new ideas. A more competitive environment would encourage greater innovation, as companies strive to offer better products and services to attract users.\n\nBut (and for me it's a big \"but\" that the court missed) Google's strenuous efforts to maintain dominance actually force competitors to be more innovative. There's no way to out-Google Google, so, whether you're Duck Duck Go or Bing or whomever, your only chance to get serious market share against Google is to be more innovative than they have been. Add to this the fact that Google has made it a wildly uneven playing field over the years, and you have a viable argument that Google has been an innovation catalyst.\n\n5. The Cost of Google Actions Is Consumer Choice and Welfare\n\nAt its core, the court's decision is about consumer welfare. Monopolies harm consumers by limiting their choices, potentially leading to higher prices. In the case of Google, its monopoly in search affects not just search results but also the ads consumers see, the data collected from them, and the overall online experience. Ensuring a competitive market would enhance consumer choice, privacy, and satisfaction.\n\nSo, what comes next?\n\nObviously, appeals. It's also very important to note that today's decision did not address penalties -- there was a box around it to just address liability. The price of that liability is to be determined soon, but so will the appeals.\n\nMonday was just the beginning of what promises to be a lengthy and complex process.\n\nThe company will likely argue that its dominance is a result of superior technology and consumer preference, not anti-competitive practices. These appeals could drag on for years, creating uncertainty in the tech industry and (this is important) giving Google the time to find new ways to Google. In other words, the appeals window lets Google go and develop ideas and products they're clearly already working on that can find new ways to win (and, probably, monopolize).\n\nAt the same time, look for regulators to take further action to ensure compliance and foster competition. This could include imposing restrictions on Google's business practices, such as limiting exclusive contracts or mandating more transparent data practices. Regulators could also push for the separation of Google's search business from its other ventures, reducing the company's ability to leverage its ecosystem to maintain its monopoly.\n\nAs mentioned above, this period is also going to (well, at least it should) embolden other tech companies and startups, encouraging them to invest in developing alternative search engines and related technologies. We could see increased investment in innovation as companies strive to offer differentiated products that can compete with Google. This could lead to a more dynamic and competitive market, benefiting consumers and the tech industry.\n\nThis ruling will likely have global repercussions. Other countries and regions, particularly the European Union, which has already fined Google for anti-competitive practices, might take similar actions. This could lead to a more coordinated international effort to curb Google's dominance and promote competition in the tech sector.\n\nI also strongly believe that this case could set a precedent for other antitrust actions against major tech companies. Regulators might feel more empowered to challenge the dominance of other tech giants like Amazon, Apple, and Facebook. This could usher in a new era of antitrust enforcement, reshaping the tech landscape and promoting a healthier competitive environment.\n\nSo, that's where we find ourselves on Monday afternoon. It's not the end of the road for Google, by any means. But it's definitely and definitively not good for the Starbucks of Search, the ubiquitous behemoth of, well, Googling.

These payments totalled more than $26 billion (\u20ac23.7 billion) in 2021, according to the decision.\n\nGoogle, whose name has become synonymous with online search, argued that it did face fierce competition in the sector and its success was driven by the quality of its products.\n\nThe ruling in the 2020 lawsuit - brought by the department of justice along with 52 US states and territories - can be appealed. Google and the DoJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe proceedings will now enter a second phase in which the court will determine what remedies Google needs to take. The DoJ has not yet indicated what penalties it would seek, but it may focus on curbing Google's ability to strike the deals at issue in the case.\n\nThe decision is the biggest win against Big Tech by US antitrust enforcers in decades.\n\nThey have filed a series of big cases striking at the core of Big Tech's power in recent years - the US DoJ has sued Apple and has a second case pending against Google, accusing it of allegedly exercising monopolistic control of the digital advertising market. The second Google trial is set to begin next month.\n\nThe US Federal Trade Commission has also filed lawsuits against Amazon and Meta.\n\nGoogle's years-long agreement with Apple to make it the default search engine on the iPhone has long drawn scrutiny. Unsealed court documents showed that Google paid Apple $20 billion in 2022 alone. This would amount to a substantial portion of Apple's $85 billion-a-year services business, which includes its App Store and Apple Pay. Apple, which is not a defendant in the case, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAlso at issue in the case were contracts the tech giant reached over the years with browser developer Mozilla, Android smartphone makers Samsung, Motorola and Sony, and wireless carriers AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile.\n\nGoogle's \"distribution agreements foreclose a substantial portion of the general search services market and impair rivals' opportunities to compete\", Judge Mehta said in the ruling.\n\nIn one victory for Google, Judge Mehta found that it did not have monopoly power in the search advertising market as plaintiffs had alleged.\n\nThe judge separately faulted the company for \"the lengths to which Google goes to avoid creating a paper trail for regulators and litigants\", but stopped short of penalising it for the behaviour, reasoning that it was not necessary to find Google guilty. Judge Mehta noted that his decision \"should not be understood as condoning Google's failure to preserve chat evidence\".\n\nShares of Google parent Alphabet were down more than 4 per cent on Monday amid a broad sell-off in US markets. -

But as long as Google remained the default search engine on devices, the average consumer would be unlikely to notice the difference.\n\nAnother potential remedy centres on Google's practice of paying other companies to use it.\n\nThe US said Google was currently paying firms like Apple more than $10bn a year to be pre-installed as the default search engine on their devices or platforms.\n\nThe judge agreed.\n\nThe contention is, had Google never spent that money, the big firms might have been encouraged to develop their own search experience.\n\nInstead, Apple's Safari browser for example uses Google by default whenever you use it to search the web.\n\nIf remedial action significantly affected Google's ability to pay other companies to use it, perhaps those firms might start a rival.\n\nHere though they would run up against Google's incredibly strong customer recognition for search. Despite its own high brand profile, it is hard to imagine telling someone to \"Apple\" something.\n\nAnd a lot of people do download rival browsers on their devices anyway, so if you're using Chrome or Firefox on your iPhone for example, you're not going to notice if Safari's search engine changes.\n\nSomething that's easier to imagine is some kind of choice screen, where people opening a browser for the first time are asked whether they'd like to use Google or an alternative like Microsoft's Bing.\n\nIt is somewhat harder to picture that causing people to abandon Google in their droves, however, for the simple reason that for most people it simply works well.\n\nThose of us with grey hairs will recall Google being one of several search engines to emerge at the dawn of the internet, with familiar rivals including Yahoo and Ask (formerly AskJeeves), and possibly less-familiar rivals including Lycos and AltaVista.\n\nBut over the next decade, Google didn't just become the dominant player in the market, it became part of the way we speak.\n\nDespite Microsoft launching its rival, Bing, in 2009, nothing has yet knocked Google off its perch.\n\nMicrosoft boss Satya Nadella testified in Google's trial, perhaps hoping a judgment like this could finally help give Bing wings.\n\nWhatever happens next, past experience suggests it won't happen quickly.\n\nBack in 1999, Microsoft found itself in a very similar situation to where Google is now.\n\nThe firm had just been found by a US judge to have created a monopoly, and a year later a court ordered the firm to be broken up.\n\nMicrosoft appealed the decision, and in 2001 the original decision to break it up was overturned.\n\nBy the end of 2002 Microsoft had agreed a settlement with the US Department of Justice, which a judge accepted.\n\nBut some US states disagreed, and it wasn't until 2004 - five years after the original ruling - that the settlement was officially signed off.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_spin-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporate spin-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltaVista", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AltaVista"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycos", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lycos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google Chrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firefox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/f004fcfccdd6f9bf11759d581c725580", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The court agreed with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) that Google has exploited this dominance to stifle competition and harm consumers.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote in his decision. \"It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.\"\n\nThe landmark case, which was first brought by the DOJ in 2020, marks the first time in a generation that the U.S. government has accused a major corporation of an illegal monopoly. It comes amid a broader crackdown on Big Tech's anti-competitive practices, with Amazon, Apple, and Meta all facing similar antitrust lawsuits from the government.\n\n\"This landmark decision holds Google accountable,\" said Jonathan Kanter, the DOJ's antitrust chief, in a statement. \"It paves the path for innovation for generations to come and protects access to information for all Americans.\"\n\nGoogle, however, has vowed to appeal the ruling, with the company's president of Global Affairs, Kent Walker, arguing that the decision \"recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available.\"\n\nThe next phase of the proceedings will determine the potential remedies for Google's antitrust violations, which could include the breakup of the tech giant's parent company, Alphabet. A separate antitrust trial between the DOJ and Google, focusing on the company's alleged monopolization of the digital advertising technology market, is also set to begin on 9th September in Virginia.\n\nThe sweeping implications of Monday's ruling are not lost on industry analysts, who view it as a potential watershed moment in the ongoing battle to rein in the power of Big Tech. The decision could pave the way for more aggressive antitrust enforcement, potentially leading to the restructuring or even the dismantling of some of the world's most influential technology companies.\n\n\"This is a historic ruling that could fundamentally reshape the tech landscape,\" said Emily Birnbaum, a technology policy expert at the think tank New America. \"The stakes couldn't be higher, and the outcome of this case will have far-reaching consequences for the future of online competition and consumer choice.\"", "source": {"uri": "dimsumdaily.hk", "dataType": "news", "title":

The company countered that its market dominance was earned through superior products and that it faced intense competition from other tech platforms.\n\nThis case is part of a broader government push to rein in the power of big tech companies. Similar antitrust lawsuits have been filed against Amazon, Apple, and Meta. The outcome of this case will likely influence how future cases are handled and could reshape the competitive landscape of the tech industry. The case against Google was filed by the Department of Justice and a bipartisan group of attorneys general from 38 states and territories, led by Colorado and Nebraska, filed similar but separate antitrust suits against Google in 2020. The suits were reportedly combined for pretrial purposes.\n\nWhat the ruling means for Google\n\nThe ruling, while a major setback for the tech giant, is just the first step in a lengthy legal process that will determine the consequences of Google's actions. It is a clear win for antitrust regulators, however, the full impact on Google's business remains to be seen. Potential remedies could include forcing Google to divest parts of its business, imposing behavioral restrictions, or imposing hefty fines.\n\n10-week trial that saw Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella and others\n\nMehta oversaw a 10-week trial in the Google search case which culminated in two days of closing arguments in early May. The trial saw many big players in Silicon Valley including Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Apple executive Eddy Cue take to the witness box. The DOJ argued that Google illegally monopolized the general search advertising market by effectively cutting off key distribution channels for rivals through exclusionary contracts.\n\nThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

A breakup was reversed on appeal, but key legal findings were upheld. And Microsoft was prohibited from forcing restrictive contracts on its industry partners and ordered to open some of its technology to outsiders -- preventing the company from single-handedly controlling the internet.\n\nMore than two decades later, a ruling in a Google antitrust case similarly promises to shape new rules for the tech industry. Judge Amit P. Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found on Monday that Google had violated antitrust laws by stifling rivals in internet search to protect its monopoly.\n\nGoogle's loss could have major ripple effects for competition today. U.S. regulators have also accused Apple, Amazon and Meta of violating antitrust laws by advantaging their own products on the platforms they run and acquiring smaller rivals. The Google ruling, and potential remedies to be decided by Judge Mehta, are likely to weigh heavily on those cases, including a second lawsuit against Google over ad technology, which is scheduled to go to trial next month.\n\nJudge Mehta's ruling is \"a predictor of what other courts might do,\" said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a Vanderbilt University law professor who studies antitrust. \"You can also expect other judges to read this opinion and be influenced by it.\"\n\nThe influence of the Microsoft antitrust case was, in fact, apparent in the Google decision. In Judge Mehta's 277-page judgment, Microsoft appeared on 104 pages, both as an aspiring rival to Google and as a legal precedent. Google has said it will appeal the ruling.\n\nAfter years of little enforcement, antitrust activism has taken off over the past few years, first under the Trump administration and then under President Biden's. The heads of antitrust enforcement at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, Jonathan Kanter and Lina Khan, have sued the other tech giants over allegations that they are monopolies engaged in illegal corporate behavior.\n\nAll of those cases hinge on the 19th-century Sherman Antitrust Act, which makes it illegal for a monopoly to engage in corporate conduct to thwart competition. But that law, designed for companies like Standard Oil, faces the continuing challenge of being applied in a different industrial environment to the new technology of its day. And both agencies have sought to test the old law by applying new legal arguments when it comes to the tech giants.\n\nWithout major cases, \"the law will stagnate,\" Mr. Kanter said in a speech in 2022. \"Congress designed antitrust law to play out in the courts.\"\n\nIn the 1990s, Microsoft was the ruling digital platform, with its Windows software controlling the experience of users on more than 90 percent of personal computers. Today, Google has a comparable grip on internet search.\n\nThat changed for Microsoft after a judge ruled it was a monopoly. Regulators had brought the suit after the software giant waged a campaign to try to crush an upstart, Netscape, the pioneering commercial browser company. Microsoft bullied PC makers with contracts that effectively stopped them from offering the Netscape browser. Ultimately, Microsoft was prohibited from restricting, in its contracts, the freedom of PC makers to offer other software, and was forced to open up some of its technology. The time, money and management attention spent, as well as the adverse public scrutiny, some antitrust experts say, did have a deterrent effect, moderating the company's behavior.\n\nThat prevented Microsoft from controlling the development of the internet, said Fiona Scott Morton, an economics professor at the Yale University School of Management.\n\n\"The goal is to open a path for future innovation,\" she said.\n\nOn Monday, Judge Mehta found that Google had broken the law through its exclusive deals with Apple, other device makers and browser companies to make Google's search engine the automatic selection.\n\nJudge Mehta praised the company for its engineering skill and investment in search. \"But Google,\" he wrote, \"has a major, largely unseen advantage over its rivals: default distribution.\"\n\nThe Google ruling is significant because \"it applies to big tech platforms the notion that while you can be dominant, you can't abuse that dominance,\" said Bill Baer, a former top antitrust official in the Justice Department.\n\nUnlike Microsoft, Google is a pure internet company with a very different business model, relying mainly on advertising rather than software licensing.\n\nIn the Google case, as in Microsoft's, the court found that contracts illegally excluded rivals. But Google's were more carrot than stick, offering industry partners generous payments rather than threats. Google paid smartphone companies and browser makers more than $26 billion in 2021, according to court testimony, to set its software to automatically handle all search queries.\n\nIn the Google case, data was described as a vital asset. The more user queries that flow through a search engine, the more data that is collected and then harnessed to improve search results, attracting still more users and generating more data.\n\n\"At every stage of the search process,\" Judge Mehta wrote, \"user data is a critical input that directly improves quality.\"\n\nGoogle's multibillion-dollar default deals ensured that the company had a huge data advantage in search, the government claimed. It also presented studies in behavioral economics that concluded people rarely switched from the automatic settings, even if doing so was not a daunting technical task. Consumer behavior was not forced but strongly steered by the power of defaults.\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Mehta pointed to \"the power of defaults.\" He cited and agreed with an expert witness for the government, Antonio Rangel, a professor of neuroscience, behavioral biology and economics at Caltech, who testified that the \"vast majority\" of searches were done by habit.\n\nIn court, Google countered that its search engine was the leader because it was a superior product; that data was important but clever software was its real advantage; and that its contracts were deals freely entered into by its industry partners.\n\nBut Google struggled to credibly explain why it paid so much to get preferred distribution if its search software was clearly the best technology. Those payments made sense, the government insisted, to ensure that Google was the winner, with its monopoly entrenched.\n\n\"That's how the government told the story, and it's a pretty convincing story,\" said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert at the University of Pennsylvania's Carey Law School.\n\nJudge Mehta will now decide what remedial steps he should order to open the search market to greater competition and new innovators.\n\nEven before his ruling, antitrust experts offered a flurry of recommendations. They run the gamut from prohibiting Google from striking exclusive deals for search distribution and sharing its search data with competitors to splitting off Google's Chrome browser or its Android mobile operating system.\n\n\"This is the first significant monopolization case against one of the dominant digital companies -- it's super-important in that sense,\" said Nancy Rose, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States v.

U.S. regulators have also accused Apple, Amazon and Meta of violating antitrust laws by advantaging their own products on the platforms they run and acquiring smaller rivals.In 2000, a ruling in a U.S. antitrust case against Microsoft helped set the rules of competition for the digital giant of its day.\n\nAt the time, a federal judge said Microsoft had abused the monopoly power of its Windows operating system and ordered that the company be split up. A breakup was reversed on appeal, but key legal findings were upheld. And Microsoft was prohibited from forcing restrictive contracts on its industry partners and ordered to open some of its technology to outsiders -- preventing the company from single-handedly controlling the internet.\n\nMore than two decades later, a ruling in a Google antitrust case similarly promises to shape new rules for the tech industry. Judge Amit P. Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found on Monday that Google had violated antitrust laws by stifling rivals in internet search to protect its monopoly.\n\nGoogle's loss could have major ripple effects for competition today. U.S. regulators have also accused Apple, Amazon and Meta of violating antitrust laws by advantaging their own products on the platforms they run and acquiring smaller rivals. The Google ruling, and potential remedies to be decided by Mehta, are likely to weigh heavily on those cases, including a second lawsuit against Google over ad technology, which is scheduled to go to trial next month.\n\nMehta's ruling is \"a predictor of what other courts might do,\" said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a Vanderbilt University law professor who studies antitrust. \"You can also expect other judges to read this opinion and be influenced by it.\"\n\nThe influence of the Microsoft antitrust case was, in fact, apparent in the Google decision. In Mehta's 277-page judgment, Microsoft appeared on 104 pages, both as an aspiring rival to Google and as a legal precedent. Google has said it will appeal the ruling.\n\nAfter years of little enforcement, antitrust activism has taken off over the past few years, first under the Trump administration and then under President Joe Biden's. The heads of antitrust enforcement at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, Jonathan Kanter and Lina Khan, have sued the other tech giants over allegations that they are monopolies engaged in illegal corporate behavior.\n\nAll of those cases hinge on the 19th-century Sherman Antitrust Act, which makes it illegal for a monopoly to engage in corporate conduct to thwart competition. But that law, designed for companies like Standard Oil, faces the continuing challenge of being applied in a different industrial environment to the new technology of its day. And both agencies have sought to test the old law by applying new legal arguments when it comes to the tech giants.\n\nWithout major cases, \"the law will stagnate,\" Kanter said in a speech in 2022. \"Congress designed antitrust law to play out in the courts.\"\n\nIn the 1990s, Microsoft was the ruling digital platform, with its Windows software controlling the experience of users on more than 90% of personal computers. Today, Google has a comparable grip on internet search.\n\nThat changed for Microsoft after a judge ruled it was a monopoly. Regulators had brought the suit after the software giant waged a campaign to try to crush an upstart, Netscape, the pioneering commercial browser company. Microsoft bullied PC makers with contracts that effectively stopped them from offering the Netscape browser. Ultimately, Microsoft was prohibited from restricting, in its contracts, the freedom of PC makers to offer other software, and was forced to open up some of its technology. The time, money and management attention spent, as well as the adverse public scrutiny, some antitrust experts say, did have a deterrent effect, moderating the company's behavior.\n\nThat prevented Microsoft from controlling the development of the internet, said Fiona Scott Morton, an economics professor at the Yale University School of Management.\n\n\"The goal is to open a path for future innovation,\" she said.\n\nOn Monday, Mehta found that Google had broken the law through its exclusive deals with Apple, other device makers and browser companies to make Google's search engine the automatic selection.\n\nMehta praised the company for its engineering skill and investment in search. \"But Google,\" he wrote, \"has a major, largely unseen advantage over its rivals: default distribution.\"\n\nThe Google ruling is significant because \"it applies to big tech platforms the notion that while you can be dominant, you can't abuse that dominance,\" said Bill Baer, a former top antitrust official in the Justice Department.\n\nUnlike Microsoft, Google is a pure internet company with a very different business model, relying mainly on advertising rather than software licensing.\n\nIn the Google case, as in Microsoft's, the court found that contracts illegally excluded rivals. But Google's were more carrot than stick, offering industry partners generous payments rather than threats. Google paid smartphone companies and browser makers more than $26 billion in 2021, according to court testimony, to set its software to automatically handle all search queries.\n\nIn the Google case, data was described as a vital asset. The more user queries that flow through a search engine, the more data that is collected and then harnessed to improve search results, attracting still more users and generating more data.\n\n\"At every stage of the search process,\" Mehta wrote, \"user data is a critical input that directly improves quality.\"\n\nGoogle's multibillion-dollar default deals ensured that the company had a huge data advantage in search, the government claimed. It also presented studies in behavioral economics that concluded people rarely switched from the automatic settings, even if doing so was not a daunting technical task. Consumer behavior was not forced but strongly steered by the power of defaults.\n\nIn his ruling, Mehta pointed to \"the power of defaults.\" He cited and agreed with an expert witness for the government, Antonio Rangel, a professor of neuroscience, behavioral biology and economics at Caltech, who testified that the \"vast majority\" of searches were done by habit.\n\nIn court, Google countered that its search engine was the leader because it was a superior product; that data was important but clever software was its real advantage; and that its contracts were deals freely entered into by its industry partners.\n\nBut Google struggled to credibly explain why it paid so much to get preferred distribution if its search software was clearly the best technology. Those payments made sense, the government insisted, to ensure that Google was the winner, with its monopoly entrenched.\n\n\"That's how the government told the story, and it's a pretty convincing story,\" said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert at the University of Pennsylvania's Carey Law School.\n\nMehta will now decide what remedial steps he should order to open the search market to greater competition and new innovators.\n\nEven before his ruling, antitrust experts offered a flurry of recommendations. They run the gamut from prohibiting Google from striking exclusive deals for search distribution and sharing its search data with competitors to splitting off Google's Chrome browser or its Android mobile operating system.\n\n\"This is the first significant monopolization case against one of the dominant digital companies -- it's super-important in that sense,\" said Nancy Rose, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States v.

This ruling marks a significant triumph for federal authorities in their ongoing battle against Big Tech's market dominance.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, presiding in Washington, D.C., articulated in his written decision that \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\" This assertion underscores the extensive control Google wields over the online search market, commanding about 90% of searches overall and 95% on smartphones. The judge highlighted how Google's financial muscle has enabled it to pay billions to secure default status on various devices, effectively stifling competition.\n\nMehta's ruling sets the stage for a consequential second trial aimed at determining appropriate remedies, which could include a potential breakup of Google's parent company, Alphabet. Such a breakup would dramatically alter the landscape of the online advertising market, a sector where Google has been the dominant force for years. This phase, however, could be protracted, potentially extending the legal battle into 2026, given the possibility of appeals to higher courts.\n\nShares of Alphabet saw a 4.5% decline on Monday amidst a broader downturn in tech stocks, fueled by recession concerns. Google's advertising business, which comprised 77% of Alphabet's total sales in 2023, has been the cornerstone of its revenue stream.\n\nAlphabet responded to the ruling with plans to appeal. In a statement, the company said, \"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available.\" The company's defense centers on the quality of its search engine and the argument that making it the default option benefits consumers.\n\nThe ruling has been lauded by government officials. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland described it as \"a historic win for the American people,\" emphasizing that \"no company - no matter how large or influential - is above the law.\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre echoed this sentiment, calling the decision \"a victory for the American people\" and asserting that \"Americans deserve an internet that is free, fair, and open for competition.\"\n\nJudge Mehta pointed out that in 2021 alone, Google spent $26.3 billion to maintain its default status on smartphones and browsers. He described this default positioning as \"extremely valuable real estate,\" noting that any potential competitor would need to offer comparable payments and compensation to device manufacturers to secure similar agreements, a barrier that effectively locks out new entrants from the market.\n\nThis ruling is a green light for aggressive antitrust enforcement against Big Tech, a sector under scrutiny from all political quarters. As the legal proceedings continue, the outcome could reshape not only Google's operations but also the broader tech industry's approach to competition and market fairness.", "source": {"uri": "shockya.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shockya.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.shockya.com/news/wp-content/uploads/Google-2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Google advertising was 77 per cent of Alphabet's total sales in 2023.\n\nAlphabet said it plans to appeal Mehta's ruling. \"This decision recognises that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Google said in a statement.\n\nUS Attorney General Merrick Garland called the ruling \"a historic win for the American people,\" adding that \"no company - no matter how large or influential - is above the law.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the \"pro-competition ruling is a victory for the American people,\" adding that \"Americans deserve an internet that is free, fair, and open for competition.\"", "source": {"uri": "deccanherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deccan Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@deccanherald.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States courts of appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://images.deccanherald.com/deccanherald%2F2024-08%2F41653117-905f-4d63-b11d-1001a2707240%2F2021newsmlRC2LWQ9Q6337962321058.jpeg?rect=0%2C57%2C3500%2C1838&w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

But no sanctions were handed down, presumably left open for future determination.\n\nFor now, then, nothing will change. But the 277-page decision (plus appendices) clearly labels Google as an illegal monopolist in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act.\n\nThe court case began in December 2020 and has moved in fits and starts ever since, over a nine-week bench trial, over 3,500 exhibits, and evidence that reached into the petabytes, the court wrote. Plaintiffs included the US government and the State of Colorado.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly. It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.\"\n\nThe court was asked whether or not Google had illegally maintained a monopoly both in its general search experience as well as its related textual advertising business. (Achieving a monopoly is not illegal, but using your market power to maintain it is.)\n\nThe court found that it had, pointing to the anticompetitive deals that Google struck with Apple and other vendors to be the default search engine on those platforms. But the court also declined to rule against Google in certain complaints, including finding that Google lacks monopoly power in the market for search ads.\n\nIn part, the case dragged on because Mehta wrote that he was \"taken aback by the lengths to which Google goes to avoid creating a paper trail for regulators and litigants.\"\n\n\"Any company that puts the onus on its employees to identify and preserve relevant evidence does so at its own peril,\" he wrote. \"Google avoided sanctions in this case. It may not be so lucky in the next one.\"\n\nThe decision could have an effect on whether companies like Apple might be required to offer consumers more options in their choice of search providers, and could have an effect on the revenue that comes from mobile advertising.

You get the big picture by page 4: Google is a monopolist.\n\nIn 2020, two separate lawsuits had been filed against Google, specifically one by the US Department of Justice and another by the State of Colorado. But that's not to say that every antitrust watchdog, every state's Attorney General and a raft of legislators and regulators were not already deep into proposed complaints and actions against the search and advertising giant.\n\nThe lawsuits alleged that Google had violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act that makes it unlawful for any person to \"monopolize, attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States or with foreign nations...\" The section continues to define Monopolization requirements specifically as \"(1) monopoly power and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen or historic incident.\"\n\nWhile discovery in the case began in late 2020, the bench trial itself did not kick off until September 2023 with closing arguments in May 2024. Throughout the plaintiffs alleged that Google held and illegally maintained a monopoly in three markets (General search services, search advertising, and general search text advertising) by entering into exclusive agreements to secure default distribution on desktop and mobile devices.\n\nJudge Amit Mehta ruled that Google was a monopolist, but more specifically, Google acted as one to maintain this monopoly in two product markets, general search services and general text advertising, and entered into distribution agreements that are exclusive and have anticompetitive effects in these markets. The court also found that Google exercised its monopoly power by \"charging supracompetitive prices for general search text ads\" allowing \"Google to earn monopoly profits.\"\n\nWhile portions of the full ruling do come down in favor of Google, excluding search advertising as a relevant product market and noting that Google was not required to work with or create deals with specific competitors or vendors in markets, the words are in literal black and white that Google is a monopoly with general search and text ads, resulting in a marketplace where Google has created and maintains its status as the only viable game in town despite the supposed availability of competitors.\n\nFor those who have been playing along with the bench trial and the release of evidence packages, this has all felt more like the boring draft of a Succession script than what is typically a rather boring straight forward case of antitrust arguments and evidentiary exchanges. From text exchanges about toggling speeds and results to convince market watchers new programs were designed to \"help the little guys\" while not making any substantive changes to the results or the ability for the \"little guys\" to beat out large advertisers in text ad auctions to the public airing of grievances between giants like Apple and Microsoft, this case has been bingeworthy and cringeworthy all at the same time.\n\nIt is of note that Google has consistently increased prices of their solutions, especially the text-based advertising units, while conversion rates have continued to decrease. In a 2024 report from LocalIQ's investigation into search advertising benchmarks, while average conversion rates had dipped from 7.85% in 2022 to 7.04% in 2023, cost per lead (CPL) had increased by about 25%, click thru rate (CTR) had increased by about 5% and cost per click (CPC) had increase by 10% across all industries. In their report findings, the question was asked as to what Google could possibly be \"tuning\" to \"keep finding ways to justify higher prices despite not delivering equally greater returns.\"\n\nWhile guilty headline of this case is a whopper, the reality here is that this trial was about liability, not about consequence or remedies. That phase of proceedings could bring anything from slaps on wrists and demands to stop doing naughty things to requirements to break-up the search business entirely. But it will certainly not bring the end to Google.\n\nThe bigger news here is that this is just ONE case...and an early one that will likely serve as precedent for multiple antitrust cases the DOJ has lined up against Google and many others. Next up for Google is the massive advertising technology case that is set to kick off in September, 2024, United States of America v Google, LLC, in which the DOJ alleges Google monopolized multiple digital advertising technology products via serial acquisitions and anticompetitive auction manipulation to subvert competition. Amazon, Apple and Meta are all facing their own lawsuits from the government as wel, making this ruling an important guidepost for how these cases may be defined and adjudicated in the future.\n\nThe crux of Googles defense was that competitors in each market has had the opportunity to compete and innovate. AI and especially the power of generative AI holds and its possible shakeup in the world of search was brought up several times in evidence and at trial. However, the court and the experts brought forward by the government said that while AI has made leaps and bounds, the standard bearing technology and processes deployed in search specifically have not made any meaningful impact or improvement in results.\n\n\"Despite these recent advances, AI has not supplanted the traditional ingredients that define general search...And it is not likely to do so anytime soon. Importantly, generative AI has not (or at least, not yet) eliminated or materially reduced the need for user data to deliver quality search results.\"\n\nIn other words, yes, AI and generative AI is a massive search opportunity...but as of the time of this ruling that oppportunity is more of an experiement wrapped in a wish than anything that could have subtantively aided the competition to make any gains against Google.\n\nAs for immediate backlash or impact on Marketers, this is a wait and see moment. The ruling has a long way to go before it actually DOES anything to Google, its business or how advertisers buy and do business with Google let alone its competitors. The biggest impact the case may have is in how an Act passed in 1890 is applied to how antitrust and market monopolization is addressed a distinctly twenty-first century digital world.\n\nGoogle for its part has already shared its intention to appeal the decision, stating that they should not be penalized for making the best search engine available. So now, we hold on until the remedy phase of the proceedings...and of course all the additional legislation that could not just change the digital advertising and marketing landscape forever.

Google's search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12 years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm BOND.\n\nGoogle almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that ultimately may land in the U..S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald Trump was still president, and has been escalating it efforts to rein in Big Tech's power during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nThe case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that Google's monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high prices while also enjoying the luxury of having to invest more time and money into improving the quality of its search engine -- a lax approach that hurt consumers.\n\nGoogle ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo -- now a minor player on the internet -- was the most popular search engine during the 1990s before Google came along.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nMehta's conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a more competitive landscape.\n\nThe potential outcome could result in a wide-ranging order requiring Google to dismantle some of the pillars of its internet empire or prevent it from shelling out more than $20 billion annually to ensure its search engine automatically answers queries on the iPhone and other internet-connected devices. After the next phase, the judge could conclude only modest changes are required to level the playing field.\n\nIf there is a significant shakeup, it could turn out to be a coup for Microsoft, whose own power was undermined during the late 1990s when the Justice Department targeted the software maker in an antitrust lawsuit accusing it of abusing the dominance of its Windows operating system on personal computers to lock out competition.\n\nThat Microsoft case mirrored the one brought against Google in several ways and now the result could also echo similarly. Just as Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle created distractions and obstacles that opened up more opportunities for Google after its 1998 inception, the decision against Google could be a boon for Microsoft, which already has a market value of more than $3 trillion. At one time, Alphabet was worth more than Microsoft, but now trails its rival with a market value of about $2 trillion.\n\nBesides boosting Microsoft's Bing search engine, the outcome could hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta's market-rattling decision.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department's star witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.\n\n\"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth and you search on Google,\" Nadella said at one point in his testimony. \"Everybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web.\"\n\nNadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown to ensure the situation didn't get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in search.\n\n\"Despite my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with A.I., I worry a lot that this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could get even more vicious,\" Nadella said on the stand.\n\nGoogle still faces other legal threats besides this one, both in the U.S. and abroad. any antitrust lawsuits brought against Google domestically and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to begin in Virginia over the Justice Department's allegations that Google's advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The suits were combined for pretrial purposes, such as discovery of evidence.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland called the decision a \"historic win for the American people.\"\n\n\"No company -- no matter how large or influential -- is above the law,\" Garland wrote in a statement. \"The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nIn its ruling, the court homed in on Google's exclusive search arrangements on Android and Apple's iPhone and iPad devices, saying that they helped to cement Google's anticompetitive behavior and dominance over the search markets.\n\nGeneral search services, according to the court, applies to Google's core search engine, where it traditionally competed with Yahoo. General search text advertising refers to the text ads that run alongside search results. The court ruled that in both of those areas, Google has operated as a monopoly. However, the ruling found that general search advertising is not a market so there can be no monopoly control.\n\nKent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said in a statement that the company plans to appeal the ruling. He highlighted the court's emphasis on the quality of Google's products.\n\n\"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available,\" Walker wrote. \"As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use.\"\n\nAlphabet shares fell more than 4% on Monday, dragged down by a broad decline in stocks worldwide.\n\nMore from CNBC:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/05/ford-pro-fleet-business-profit-driver-gm-stellantis.html\">Ford turns 'dirty' business into a profit driver.

It also reveals that Google recognised that its search revenue would be severely impacted if Apple were to develop and deploy its own search engine as the default in Safari.\n\nAlthough the court chose not to sanction Google for its failure to preserve chat evidence, the court document shows that, for years, the search engine giant had directed its employees to avoid using certain antitrust buzzwords in their communications.\n\nCiting a March 2011 Google presentation titled \"Antitrust Basics for Search Team\", the court documents show that Google directed employees to \"[a]void references to 'markets' or 'market share' or 'dominance'\", \"[a]void discussions of 'scale' and 'network effects'\" and \"[a]void metaphors involving wars or sports, winning or losing\". The Memorandum Opinion document also shows that Google urged employees to \"[a]ssume every document you generate ... will be seen by regulators\".\n\nThe court document presented examples of how Google trained its employees to add its in-house lawyers on any written communication regarding revenue sharing and the MADA device-by-device licence that allows mobile device manufacturers to use Google's proprietary mobile applications developed for the Android ecosystem. It also instructed that, when \"dealing with a sensitive issue\" via email, to \"ensure the email communication is privileged\", which means employees could add a lawyer as an additional recipient on any email correspondence to claim the communications were legal advice. This meant that, initially, Google's lawyers withheld tens of thousands of records on the grounds of privilege.\n\nThe plaintiffs contended that the creation of faux privileged materials \"demonstrates that Google intended to harm competition through its contracting practices and its supposed procompetitive justifications were simply pretext\".\n\nIn his conclusion, judge Amit P Mehta said: \"Any company that puts the onus on its employees to identify and preserve relevant evidence does so at its own peril. Google avoided sanctions in this case. It may not be so lucky in the next one.\"\n\nAttorney general Merrick Kanter called the victory against Google \"an historic win for the American people\", adding: \"No company - no matter how large or influential - is above the law. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce our antitrust laws.\"\n\nAssistant attorney general Jonathan Garland said the landmark decision held Google accountable. \"It paves the path for innovation for generations to come and protects access to information for all Americans,\" he said. \"This victory is a reflection on the tireless efforts of the dedicated public servants at the Antitrust Division and our state law enforcement partners whose work made today's decision possible.\"\n\nWhile Alphabet, the parent company of Google, may have lost this case, it is likely to appeal, and any fines or changes to its business practices may take year to be enforced, as Emile El Nems, vice-president for Moody's Ratings notes. \"While today's ruling will likely be appealed and may take years to materialise, we believe that Alphabet's scale, continued strong execution and financial strength mitigate this legal risk and the possible ensuing financial and business model ramifications,\" he said.\n\nGoogle also faces continued scrutiny over its business practices from anticompetitive regulators in other regions.\n\nIn 2017, the European Commission fined Google \u20ac2.42bn for abusing its dominance as a search engine by giving illegal advantages to its own comparison shopping service. At the time, commissioner Margrethe Vestager said: \"Google's strategy for its comparison shopping service wasn't just about attracting customers by making its product better than those of its rivals. Instead, Google abused its market dominance as a search engine by promoting its own comparison shopping service in its search results and demoting those of competitors. In 2018, it was fined \u20ac4.34bn for imposing illegal restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators to cement its dominant position in general internet search.\"\n\nIn 2023, the European Commission also informed Google of its preliminary view that the company breached European Union antitrust rules by distorting competition in the advertising technology industry (adtech).\n\nIn the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has been looking at the planned roll-out of Google's Privacy Sandbox, which would be detrimental to organisations that use third-party cookies in Chrome for tracking web usage. Following a consultation process, Google has revised its plans and will continue to support third-party cookies.\n\n\"Throughout this process, we've received feedback from a wide variety of stakeholders, including regulators like the UK's CMA and Information Commissioner's Office, publishers, web developers and standards groups, civil society, and participants in the advertising industry,\" said Anthony Chavez, Google vice-president of Privacy Sandbox.\n\n\"This feedback has helped us craft solutions that aim to support a competitive and thriving marketplace that works for publishers and advertisers, and encourage the adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies.\"", "source": {"uri": "computerweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Computer Weekly"}, "authors": [],

That same year, Google earned more than $146 billion in advertising revenue, according to the ruling.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"These distribution deals have forced Google's rivals to find other ways to reach users,\" the ruling said.\n\nThe Mountain View-based subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. has increasingly cornered the market for web searching. In 2009, 80% of U.S. web searches went through Google. By 2020, that figure was nearly 90%, according to the ruling. Almost 95% of mobile searches used Google.\n\nGoogle's next closest competitor -- Microsoft's Bing -- took up just 6% of web searches, the ruling said.\n\nThis dominance of the search market caught the attention of antitrust regulators, and by 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice and multiple state attorneys general had filed two separate lawsuits against the tech giant.\n\nDuring the course of legal proceedings, dozens of witnesses were deposed, including high-ranking tech executives. The bench trial started in September 2023 and lasted for nine weeks. Closing arguments occurred in May.\n\nIt's not yet clear what the ruling will mean for Google, particularly since the company plans to appeal and there will be further proceedings about potential remedies.\n\n\"We're still in the middle of the game, as opposed to the end of the game,\" said Colin Kass, a partner in the litigation department at Proskauer and co-head of the firm's antitrust group.\n\nBut if the ruling stands, it could force Google to revisit how it does deals with outside companies for the opportunity to be the default search engine, said Jef Pearlman, clinical professor of law and director of the intellectual property and technology law clinic at the University of Southern California's Gould School of Law.\n\n\"If it stands, this will limit their current approach,\" he said.\n\nThe ruling is less likely to have an effect on the other pending tech federal antitrust cases, mostly because the Google case focuses so narrowly on the market for web searches, which is not relevant to the other lawsuits, legal experts said.\n\nBut it could serve as a warning for artificial intelligence companies, which are starting to make deals with outside companies to use their technology and could run into similar issues as Google did with its default search engine agreements.\n\nThough the AI market is still nascent, \"they will be thinking of this as they pen those deals,\" Pearlman said.\n\nIs early childhood education ready for AI?

(Representational)\n\nWashington:\n\nUS District Judge Amit Mehta on Monday ruled that Google had violated antitrust law by spending billions of dollars to secure exclusive agreements with developers, carriers and equipment makers to be the default search engine.\n\nHere are some key statements the judge made in his 277-page ruling:\n\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\"\n\n\"Sure, users can access Google's rivals by switching the default search access point or by downloading a rival search app or browser. But the market reality is that users rarely do so.\"\n\n\"The default is extremely valuable real estate. Because many users simply stick to searching with the default, Google receives billions of queries every day through those access points.\"\n\n\"Google, of course, recognises that losing defaults would dramatically impact its bottom line. For instance, Google has projected that losing the Safari default would result in a significant drop in queries and billions of dollars in lost revenues.\"\n\n\"The distribution agreements have caused a third key anticompetitive effect: They have reduced the incentive to invest and innovate in search.\"\n\n\"There is no genuine 'competition for the contract.' Google has no true competitor.\"\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\n\"Google has not achieved market dominance by happenstance. It has hired thousands of highly skilled engineers, innovated consistently, and made shrewd business decisions.

Mehta said in a 286-page opinion that \"Google's distribution agreements have constrained the query volumes of its rivals, thereby inoculating Google against any genuine competitive threat.\"\n\nGoogle has spent tens of billions of dollars, including an estimated $20 billion payout in 2022 to Apple alone, on deals to secure a dominant position as the default search provider on smartphones and browsers.

That case is expected to head to trial in early September.\n\nIn that case, prosecutors allege that \"Google's conduct has drastically altered the supply paths through which available display advertising inventory is sold, reducing payouts to publishers, burdening advertisers and publishers with lower-quality matches of advertisements to inventory, and inhibiting choice and innovation across the ad tech stack.\"\n\nAs The Stack reported in May, Google had offered a \"cashier's check, payable to the United States\" as it tried to kill off a Department of Justice bid for a jury trial. In June a federal judge agreed with Google's position that this was improper. The case will be heard by the judge on September 6. Google suggested in May in its motion to a district court that \"a sovereign such as the United States has no right to a jury trial under the Seventh Amendment, even for its damages claim; and second, although Google continues to vigorously contest liability, its tender of full monetary relief moots the damages claim and streamlines the litigation...\"", "source": {"uri": "thestack.technology", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Stack"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firefox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mozilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.thestack.technology/content/images/size/w1200/2024/08/growtika-dUMEnARXgJU-unsplash.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 442, "textEnd": 450}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-06", "textStart": 2457, "textEnd": 2468}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Mehta of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia determined that Alphabet's payments of $26 billion to Apple and others to make Google the default search engine blocked competitors from succeeding in the market.\n\nThe judge notes that measured by query volume, Google enjoys an 89.2% share of the market for general search services, which increases to 94.9% on mobile devices. This overwhelms Bing's share of 5.5% on all queries and 1.3% on mobile, as well as Yahoo's and DDG's shares, which are under 3% regardless of device type.\n\nGoogle's distribution agreements are designed to maintain that dominance.\n\n\"Google's distribution agreements are exclusionary contracts that violate Section 2 because they ensure that half of all GSE users in the United States will receive Google as the preloaded default on all Apple and Android devices, as well as cause additional anticompetitive harm,\" writes Judge Mehta.\n\n\"When the distribution agreements have created an ecosystem that has a 'strong incentive' to do 'nothing,' is 'resistant to change,' and is 'basically [frozen] in place,' there is no genuine 'competition for the contract' in search.\"\n\nHere's a summary of the findings in the case...\n\nThe judge's ruling in the case against Google concluded that:\n\n1. Google's Monopoly Power: Google holds monopoly power in the markets for general search services and general search text advertisements. The evidence showed that Google has maintained a dominant market share in these markets, often exceeding 90%.\n\n2. Anticompetitive Conduct: Google's use of exclusive agreements with browser developers, mobile device manufacturers, and wireless carriers was found to be anticompetitive. These agreements set Google as the default search engine, significantly limiting the ability of rival search engines to compete. This was further exacerbated by the fact that most users do not change default settings.\n\n3. Foreclosure of Competition: The court found that Google's exclusive agreements foreclosed a substantial share of the market to its rivals, depriving them of scale, which is crucial for improving and innovating in search services.\n\n4. Supracompetitive Pricing: Google's control over the market enabled it to charge supracompetitive prices for general search text ads, which contributed to its substantial profits.\n\n5. Lack of Procompetitive Justifications: Google did not provide valid procompetitive justifications for its exclusive agreements that outweighed the anticompetitive effects.\n\nThe court ruled in favor of Google on several key points, where the Department of Justice (DOJ) failed to prove their case:\n\n1. Search Advertising Market: The court found that while there is a product market for search advertising, Google does not possess monopoly power in this market.\n\n2. General Search Advertising Market: The DOJ failed to establish a distinct product market for general search advertising.\n\n3. SA360 and Microsoft's Ad Features: The court determined that Google had no duty to provide feature parity for Microsoft's Ads on SA360. The DOJ did not prove that Google's conduct had anticompetitive effects in this context, as there was insufficient evidence showing that the lack of certain features, like auction time bidding (ATB), significantly harmed competitors or advertisers.\n\n4. Sanctions for Document Preservation: The court declined to impose sanctions on Google for failing to preserve chat messages, noting that this failure did not significantly impact the overall assessment of Google's liability.\n\nYou can read the full ruling here.

Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court. The legal wrangling could play out into next year, or even 2026.\n\nShares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O), opens new tab fell 4.3% on Monday as part of a broad tech share decline.\n\nAlphabet said it plans to appeal Judge Mehta's ruling.\n\nMehta noted that Google had paid $26.3 billion in 2021 alone to ensure that its search engine is the default on smartphones and browsers, and to keep its dominant market share.\n\n\"The default is extremely valuable real estate... Even if a new entrant were positioned from a quality standpoint to bid for the default when an agreement expires, such a firm could compete only if it were prepared to pay partners upwards of billions of dollars in revenue share and make them whole for any revenue shortfalls resulting from the change,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nHe noted \"Google, of course, recognizes that losing defaults would dramatically impact its bottom line. For instance, Google has projected that losing the Safari default would result in a significant drop in queries and billions of dollars in lost revenues.\"\n\nThe ruling is the first major decision in a series of cases taking on alleged monopolies in Big Tech. This case, filed by the Trump administration, went before a judge from September to November.\n\n\"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, who noted a drawn out legal process will delay any immediate effects for consumers.\n\nIn the past four years, federal antitrust regulators have also sued Meta Platforms (META.O), opens new tab, Amazon.com (AMZN.O), opens new tab, and Apple Inc (AAPL.O), opens new tab, claiming the companies have illegally maintained monopolies. Another case against Google over its advertising technology is scheduled to go to trial in September.\n\nSpeaking before the ruling, William Kovacic, a professor at George Washington University Law School, said a DOJ victory is likely to boost the morale of antitrust enforcers in other cases.\n\n\"It's very good for their larger campaign to apply the law effectively in this sector,\" he said.\n\nWhen it was filed in 2020, the Google search case was the first time in a generation that the U.S. government accused a major corporation of an illegal monopoly. Microsoft settled with the Justice Department in 2004 over claims that it forced its Internet Explorer web browser on Windows users.\n\nReporting by David Shepardson, Mike Scarcella and Chris Sanders

As he's explaining what all the pieces do, how they move, and why, there's a point when D'Angelo shares an important insight about one particular kind of piece: \"See, the king stay the king.\" In other words, he's saying that everything but the pawns remains what they are in the long run -- a metaphor, obviously, for The Wire's larger message about life and poverty and growing up on the mean streets of Baltimore.\n\nBecause of how Judge Amit Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled today against the search giant -- writing at one point in her decision that \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly\" -- I feel that quote from The Wire also has some application to the situation that now confronts the king of internet search. And it's not necessarily because of what the ruling means for Google; that's something we actually don't know yet, since the judge will decide later what he thinks the remedies for Google's behavior should be.\n\nI'm thinking, instead, about the recipients of Google's search engine payola payments. Recipients like Apple, which earned a cool $20 billion from Google in exchange for making Google Search the default on Apple devices (per reporting from The Verge). Those payments are at the heart of the judge's ruling that Google has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act \"by maintaining its monopoly in two product markets in the United States -- general search services and general text advertising -- through its exclusive distribution agreements.\"\n\nBut let's think this through, as far as what comes down the line from this.\n\nIf Google's payments are illegal, that means it'll eventually have to stop giving those payments to device makers like Apple once the case is fully litigated. Meanwhile, a reasonable person would assume that most people will continue to either proactively choose Google or will simply let Google remain as their default search engine going forward.\n\nThe only difference between then and now?\n\nDevice makers like Apple will stop getting paid.

dominant search engine.\n\nThe landmark decision against a \"big tech\" giant could alter how the sector operates in future.\n\nDistrict Court Judge Amit Mehta found that Google maintained a monopoly for search and for text ads through exclusive distribution agreements that made it the \"default\" option that people were likely to use on devices.\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote in his ruling.\n\nThe internet behemoth \"has a major, largely unseen advantage over its rivals: default distribution,\" he added.\n\nThe anti-trust trial pitting US prosecutors against Google ended in May with a two-day hearing.\n\nThe case was the first of five major lawsuits by the US government to reach trial, with Meta, Amazon, Apple and a separate case against Google also heading for federal courtrooms.\n\nHeld in Washington, the trial was the first time the US Department of Justice has faced a big tech company in court since Microsoft was targeted more than two decades ago over the dominance of its Windows operating system.\n\nMehta presided over several months of testimony late last year that saw Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other top executives take the stand.\n\nAt the heart of the government's case was the massive payments made by Google to Apple and other companies to keep its world-leading search engine as the default on iPhones, web browsers and other products.\n\nCourt testimony revealed

A federal judge has determined that Google illegally maintained its dominance in the search and advertising markets, violating US antitrust law.\n\nRead: Nintendo sales plummet as gamers anticipate next-gen Switch\n\nJudge Amit Mehta, in a comprehensive decision, found that Google has acted as a monopoly to protect its market position. The company's exclusive contracts with tech giants like Apple to be the default search engine were deemed anticompetitive, effectively shutting out rivals.\n\nThe Department of Justice, which brought the case, hailed the ruling as a victory for consumers and innovation. The decision could reshape the digital landscape and pave the way for increased competition in the search market.\n\nThe judge found that Google's market share in general search is overwhelmingly dominant, with Bing as a distant second. The company's exclusive deals with device manufacturers, coupled with its massive financial incentives, have created an insurmountable barrier for competitors.\n\nMehta also concluded that Google abused its power in search advertising, charging excessive prices due to the lack of competition. The company's arguments about quality-adjusted pricing were dismissed as weak and self-serving.\n\nThe ruling is just the first step in a lengthy legal process. Google has vowed to appeal the decision, and the company's future remains uncertain. Potential remedies could range from behavioural restrictions to a forced breakup of the search business.\n\nThe broader implications of the case are significant. It marks a major victory for antitrust enforcement in the tech industry and could influence similar cases against Amazon, Apple, and Meta. The decision highlights the challenges of applying century-old antitrust laws to rapidly evolving digital markets.\n\nDuckDuckGo, a Google competitor, celebrated the ruling as a step in the right direction but cautioned that the fight is far from over. The company believes that increased competition will benefit consumers by providing more choices and better search results.\n\nGoogle, on the other hand, maintains that its success is due to superior products and consumer preference. The company has pledged to continue developing innovative services while contesting the ruling in court.\n\nThe case underscores the complex interplay between technological advancement and antitrust regulation. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, so too will the legal battles over market power and consumer protection.", "source": {"uri": "bandwidthblog.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bandwidth Blog"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDuckGo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DuckDuckGo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer protection"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://bandwidthblog.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/google-search-monopoly-antitrust-case.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The judge did not issue any remedy for the violations, however.\n\nJudge Amit Mehta of the federal district court for the District of Columbia says Google illegally cemented its place as the world's number one search engine by working with other companies to keep competitors locked out of the market. The lawsuit was filed by President Trump's Justice Department and several states in 2020, and resulted in a lengthy trial last year.\n\nJudge Mehta agreed with the government's argument that Google's business practices were monopolistic in nature. While Google in 2020 handled 90 percent of all searches, the second-most used engine took only six percent of searches. That engine was Microsoft's Bing.\n\nMicrosoft's chief executive, Satya Nadella, testified at the 2023 trial that Google and other companies created a kind of oligopoly in search engine technology. Mr. Nadella said that it could threaten the development of new technologies like artificial intelligence going forward, according to the New York Times.\n\nThe snowball effect of Google becoming such a dominant search engine was aided, in part, by the company's use of user data to create a smarter, faster technology. \"Google is winning because it's better,\" the company's lawyer, John Schmidtlein, said at closing arguments last year, according to the Times.\n\nJudge Mehta ruled that it was not just the company's technology or innovation that allowed it to become the dominant search engine, but its ability to suppress competitors by maintaining an overwhelming advantage in contract bids, for example. \"Google's immense revenues and large profit margins allow it to capture significant surplus from the challenged contracts,\" Judge Mehta wrote.\n\nOn the question of \"indirect\" evidence of monopolistic behavior, the judge writes that plaintiffs have \"easily\" demonstrated that market share domination exists, and that the company has raised the barriers of entry into the search engine market.\n\nA spokesman for Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn the late stages of the Trump administration, Justice Department antitrust lawyers began investigating Silicon Valley giants for alleged monopolistic practices -- investigations that have resulted in pending lawsuits from the DOJ and action by the Federal Trade Commission.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"},

One thing it always has in common is that it's complicated; often sorting through it all still leaves us scratching our heads.\n\nI don't always have the answers, but my experience and expertise will help me filter out those important bits. The things that matter. The things we really need to care about.\n\nAfter all, technology is supposed to make things easier and better. Anything else is just a by-product.\n\nJudge Amit P. Mehta has decided that Google is a monopoly when it comes to the search and advertising markets. If you use a phone or a computer, you probably agree with that. This is big news and is the first of the Department of Justice's big tech anti-trust trials. Google has another one coming, as does Apple, Amazon, and Meta.\n\nA Google spokesperson gave Android Central the following statement from Kent Walker, Google's president of Global Affairs, in response to the ruling:\n\n\"This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available. We appreciate the Court's finding that Google is 'the industry's highest quality search engine, which has earned Google the trust of hundreds of millions of daily users,' that Google 'has long been the best search engine, particularly on mobile devices,' 'has continued to innovate in search' and that 'Apple and Mozilla occasionally assess Google's search quality relative to its rivals and find Google's to be superior.'\"\n\nReading this, I think Google is right, and its search product is the best. I'm not sure if hundreds of millions of people use it because they trust Google or because it's the default, which supports the court's findings. A lot of people don't know if Google Search is the best because they haven't been exposed to alternative options.\n\nEach company has its own set of online fans and detractors. As I type this, people are busy in online comments and on social media arguing why this is unfair and why it's not.\n\nI'm not a lawyer, not even close. That means much of the 286-page-long court decision reads like it's in another language to me. I get the gist of some of it and think some of the findings are valid, and some may not be.\n\nThen again, I'm not a lawyer. I'm a cowboy who wrangles words instead of steers.\n\nSome people are lawyers and have a handle on what all those pages mean and if you are curious about what Google has done and how it broke the law, you should read what they have to say about it. Feel free to ignore the tech-bro Xitter crowd though unless you want to watch the bonfire.\n\nOne thing I do understand is that this will have almost no effect on me. I want the DoJ to go after these tech companies and the billions and billions of dollars to make sure they are dotting every i and crossing every t. No single company should have an insurmountable advantage in any market and be able to leverage it to drive competition out of business. Investigate them as much as you can.\n\nI just want it all to actually matter once the dust settles even though I know it won't.\n\nIt's important and it does matter for a lot of companies and the whole business around search and online ads. It should matter more and be an effective path toward changes that trickle down to consumers like you and me, but I'm not going to hold my breath. If anything, the price we pay for a new phone will climb a few dollars.\n\nThe big tech shakeup is probably going to have the same effect on us regular folks as Microsoft's antitrust trial years ago did. Some words on some pages will change, deals will be renegotiated, and money will change hands. So much money will change hands. For us though? Imagine a new check box when you first sign into an iPhone and you've got the picture.\n\nThe rules always favor the players that know how to exploit them. When it comes to search and online ads, that's Google. They're the New England Patriots of internet search. Google will weather this storm through years of appeals, meanwhile shifting its strategies and ways of making money to better comply in case it doesn't get away with it in the end.\n\nIn a perfect world, the penalty phase of these tech antitrust trials would be held back and kept secret until all the guilty parties are ferreted out. then swing it down in one big blow of the hammer and shake everything and everyone up.\n\nIn the real world, Google will keep on being Google and finding ways to try and make all the money from all the things. The same goes for the rest of the big tech companies that seem to want to set their own rules and policies until they get caught.\n\nOne day a company will dethrone google when it comes to search and ads.

Judge Amit P. Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia declared that Google had indeed abused its monopoly power in the online search business. This decision has significant implications not only for Google but for all major tech giants like Apple, Amazon, and Meta.\n\nThe government's argument that Google paid billions of dollars to companies like Apple and Samsung to ensure its search engine was the default option on their devices was found to be valid by Judge Mehta. This practice was seen as a way for Google to stifle competition and maintain its dominant position in the market.\n\nThis ruling marks a turning point in the battle against Big Tech monopolies. It signals a potential limit to the power these companies have wielded over the internet and how we interact with it. The decision is expected to have a ripple effect on other antitrust cases pending against tech giants.\n\nFor Google, this ruling could have far-reaching consequences. As a company that has built its empire on the success of its search engine, being labeled a monopolist could tarnish its reputation and impact its future business strategies. Google is currently facing another antitrust case related to its ad technology, further adding to its legal woes.\n\nExperts believe that this ruling sets the stage for more antitrust action against Big Tech companies in the future. The case against Google is seen as just the beginning of a series of legal battles that will shape the future of the tech industry. It underscores the growing scrutiny and pushback against the unchecked power of tech giants.\n\nOverall, the ruling against Google is a significant development that could have long-lasting effects on the tech industry. It highlights the need for stricter regulations and oversight to prevent monopolistic practices and ensure fair competition in the digital marketplace. As the tech landscape continues to evolve, it is clear that the era of unbridled dominance by Big Tech companies may be coming to an end.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the District of Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://usanews.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/news-06082024-125049.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

But the market reality is that users rarely do so.\"\n\n\"The default is extremely valuable real estate. Because many users simply stick to searching with the default, Google receives billions of queries every day through those access points.\"\n\n\"Google, of course, recognizes that losing defaults would dramatically impact its bottom line. For instance, Google has projected that losing the Safari default would result in a significant drop in queries and billions of dollars in lost revenues.\"\n\n\"The distribution agreements have caused a third key anticompetitive effect: They have reduced the incentive to invest and innovate in search.\"\n\n\"There is no genuine 'competition for the contract.' Google has no true competitor.\"\n\n\"Google has not achieved market dominance by happenstance. It has hired thousands of highly skilled engineers, innovated consistently, and made shrewd business decisions.

Mehta of the US District Court for the District of Columbia said Google abused a monopoly over the search business, adding that the company spent tens of billions of dollars on exclusive contracts to secure a dominant position as the global search provider. The judge noted that these contracts gave Google the ability to block out potential rivals, including Microsoft's Bing and DuckDuckGo.\n\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Judge Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nIt is unclear what penalties Google will face. The ruling could impact how the tech giant makes its search engine available to users. The court could also force Google to allow users to choose between search engines, according to CNN, citing Vanderbilt University law professor Rebecca Allensworth.\n\nApart from the search lawsuit, Google is also facing another suit over online advertising. In that suit, Google was accused of using anticompetitive mergers and bullying publishers and advertisers into using the company's ad technology. That case is set to go on trial in September.\n\nREAD ALSO: Nvidia Finally Faces DOJ Antitrust Investigation After Push From Senator Warren and US Progressives\n\nMonday's landmark decision will likely influence other government antitrust lawsuits against large tech companies.\n\nAmazon, for instance, has been sued by the FTC and 17 states in September for allegedly squeezing sellers on its vast marketplace. This practice may have resulted in \"artificially higher prices\" for consumers.\n\nIn March, the Justice Department sued Apple for using its monopoly in the smartphone market to block rivals from offering applications that competed with its products, including cloud-based streaming apps and digital wallets. This inflated prices for consumers and stifled competition.\n\nMeta is also facing an antitrust lawsuit where the FTC accused the company of creating a monopoly in the social media industry after it bought Instagram and WhatsApp. However, Meta argued it only acquired Instagram and WhatsApp as part of its effort to invest heavily in developing innovations for the apps.", "source": {"uri":

It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.\"\n\nThe court determined that Google's distribution agreements were exclusive and had significant anti-competitive effects, preventing rivals from gaining market share and reducing innovation and consumer choice.\n\nDespite Google's arguments that its practices were pro-competitive and justified by the quality of its services, the court found these justifications insufficient.\n\nIt emphasized that Google's conduct allowed the company to charge \"supracompetitive prices for general search text ads,\" enabling it to earn substantial monopoly profits.\n\nThe court is expected to impose measures to restore competitive conditions in the affected markets.\n\nGoogle has not yet announced whether it will appeal the decision, but the ruling will likely prompt significant changes in how the company conducts its business in the future.\n\nThe Epoch Times has reached out to Google for comment.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_network_operator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile network operator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sherman Antitrust Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epoch Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/05/id5699960-CP215230872-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 22, "textEnd": 28}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-10-", "textStart": 206, "textEnd": 218}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

The judge's decision declares that Google has illegally maintained a monopoly over internet search, potentially reshaping the digital landscape. Here's everything you need to know about this landmark ruling and how it might affect your tech experience.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta has ruled that Google's dominance in the search engine market is illegal. According to the ruling, Google controls a staggering 89.2% of the search market and an even more impressive 94.9% on mobile devices. This ruling marks a pivotal moment in one of the most significant antitrust cases in decades.\n\nThe court found that Google used its massive influence to sideline competitors, stifling innovation and maintaining its stronghold through exclusive deals. This is not just a legal victory for the Justice Department but a potential turning point for the tech industry and for consumers.\n\nThe heart of the case lies in Google's practice of paying billions to secure its search engine as the default option on smartphones and other devices. For instance, Google spent over \u20b92 lakh crore in 2021 alone to lock in these default agreements. This practice has been seen as a key factor in Google's overwhelming market share, making it hard for other search engines to compete.\n\nThe ruling has cast a shadow over Apple, a major beneficiary of Google's payments. Apple received around \u20b916.6 lakh crore from Google in 2022 alone, a crucial revenue stream that has bolstered its earnings. With Google's agreements now under scrutiny, Apple could face changes to this lucrative arrangement.\n\nJudge Mehta's ruling is a significant victory for antitrust regulators, but the battle is far from over. Here's what to expect next:\n\nFor smartphone users, this ruling could eventually lead to more choices and better services. Here's how:\n\nWhile the immediate effects of the decision may not be felt right away, the long-term impact could be substantial. Whether it's changes in how you use your smartphone or shifts in how tech giants operate, this case marks a significant moment in tech history.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "siddharth_shankar@news9live.com", "name": "Siddharth Shankar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/google-search-apple-lawsuit.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

But the market reality is that users rarely do so.\"\n\nThe judge said that Google knows the value of being the default search engine on devices as \"the default is extremely valuable real estate.

He wrote, \"The distribution agreements have caused a third key anticompetitive effect: They have reduced the incentive to invest and innovate in search. There is no genuine 'competition for the contract.' Google has no true competitor.\"\n\nGoogle has not achieved market dominance by happenstance, the judge noted.

What does this mean for internet users?", "body": "A US court observed that Google abused its monopoly over the search business\n\nIt is the biggest blow yet to Big Tech, and it could well change the way you, me, and everyone use the internet. A US Court, on Tuesday morning (India time), ruled that Google was a monopolist, in what could well pave the way for a domino effect.\n\nAccording to Amit P. Mehta, judge at the District of Columbia court in the US, the search engine behemoth abused its monopoly over the search business, in a case filed by the US government's Department of Justice. The case accused Google of illegally cementing its dominance, in part, by paying billions of dollars to other companies, particularly mobile phone heavyweights Apple and Samsung, to make Google their default search engine.\n\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Judge Mehta said in his ruling.\n\nThe ruling is the strongest in the long-going campaign, both by civil society as well as governments, to rein in Big Tech companies like Google, Meta (parent of WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram) etc. While some severe penalties, some running above a billion, were imposed on Google earlier by European regulators, this is the strongest pushback yet, and reinforced this time by the justice system no less.\n\nIt could well spark off renewed interest in reigning in Big Tech, with cases pending against all the big names across the world.\n\nALSO READ: 'Monopolist' Google squashed search engine rivals, violated antitrust laws: US judge\n\n\"This judgement is of great significance and a warning shot for all of us to take cognisance of the developing monopolies amongst the most popular Internet utilities,\" said Sanjay Padode, president, Vijayabhoomi University, and founder of JAGSoM.\n\n\"In my view that the competition is only going to get tougher for these companies,\" he added.\n\nIn India too, companies like Google have been at the crosshairs of the Competition Commission of India, the official watchdog. On Monday, the Alliance of Digital India Foundation was reported to have filed a complaint with the CCI against Google over its alleged anti-competitive practices in the online advertising space.\n\nWhile Google has said it will appeal the decision, the more important things to watch out for are two -- one, whether this spurs off similar action and judgements against other Big Tech firms in the US, considering that many, like Apple, are already battling similar cases. Authorities in the US have long claimed that Google through its control of the search business and Apple through its iPhone ecosystem created what they termed as \"walled gardens,\" locking in consumers from changing to alternative services.\n\nSecond, and perhaps the worst-case scenario for Google (and for others), is whether America's stringent antitrust body will step in and break up the entity. In the past, companies that dominated the market too much have faced this ultimate action, with the most famous example that of telecom major Ma Bell, which was broken up by the government in 1984 into seven entities, like the still-surviving AT&T.\n\nWhatever the outcome, it is quite possible that these actions could check the unbridled power of big tech companies, though not only will they fight it every inch of the way, they will find new tech-fuelled modes to get around them as well, continuing a 'click'-and-dagger race that has always found governments playing catch up pretty belatedly.\n\n\"The world needs a systematic change and it needs to address this differently by developing universal regulations that prevent such monopolies reaching a destructive level,\" said Padode. \"A lot of the success of these utilities is based on their ability to detect human behaviour patterns and build business models that thrive on this personal information.

investigations and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is investigating Microsoft for potential violations as well.\n\nApple is also under DOJ investigation for possibly breaking antitrust laws with a

Key to the decision was the ruling that Google has paid $26bn to ensure that its search engine was placed on smartphones and web browsers as the default option. This essentially meant that its competitors were prevented from making inroads into this market. The judge said:\n\nThe trial evidence firmly established that Google's monopoly power, maintained by the exclusive distribution agreements, has enabled Google to increase text ads prices without any meaningful competitive constraint.\n\nHe pointed out that the company's distribution agreement contained clauses that impaired the opportunities for rivals to compete with it.\n\nDon't miss out the latest news, subscribe to LeapRate's newsletter\n\nIn this way, Google was able to carry on raising the cost of online advertising without suffering any negative consequences.

You can change the default search engine in Settings > Safari, but most users don't-as is often the case with defaults, most aren't even aware there are other options.\n\nA years-long federal lawsuit, filed by the Department of Justice and nearly every state's Attorney General, ended its closing arguments in May of this year.\n\nNo court-mandated remedies or injunctions have been ordered yet. We won't know exactly what this will mean for the users of Apple products in the future until we have a clearer picture of exactly what the court requires.\n\nIt is likely that Google and Apple will be forbidden from entering into a default search exclusivity arrangement in the future, for which Google pays Apple billions per year. It's quite possible that we'll see a \"choose your default search engine\" interface on a future version of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS similar to the \"browser ballots\" where default web browsers must be chosen.\n\nApple may even decide that, without billions to be made selling default search access on its platforms, the time is right for the company to make (or acquire) its own privacy-minded web search tools.", "source": {"uri": "macworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Macworld"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_cross@macworld.com", "name": "Jason Cross", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MacOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/google-1.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Such dominance has sparked widespread concern over its potential to hinder competition and innovation.\n\nJudge Amit Mehta's thorough 277-page analysis brings to light several issues. Firstly, it asserts Google's monopolistic tactics aimed at maintaining market dominance.\n\nThe ruling specifically points out Google's billion-dollar expenditures to remain the default search engine across various platforms as a central element of its strategy. These actions, according to the judge, have significantly limited the competitive landscape.\n\nThis ruling poses profound challenges for Google and its parent company, Alphabet, potentially prompting major organizational changes or even a breakup of its entities.\n\nGoogle's Search Advertising Business at Risk\n\nGoogle's search advertising business, a major revenue stream that generated nearly $240 billion last year, stands at risk. Moreover, Google plans to appeal, potentially escalating the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThis decision may benefit competitors like Microsoft's Bing and DuckDuckGo. It would provide them with a more level playing field in the search market.\n\nIt could also influence the competitive dynamics within AI-powered search technologies. This case is deemed the most consequential antitrust lawsuit since the 1998 action against Microsoft.\n\nThat lawsuit similarly dealt with monopoly issues and opened opportunities for new tech players, including Google itself.\n\nAlthough this ruling is specific to the U.S., it reflects a global push toward regulating big tech entities to ensure fair competition.\n\nThe court's decision sets the stage for further proceedings to determine suitable remedies or penalties.\n\nThis could include breaking up Google's business segments, imposing restrictions on its spending for default search positions, and fostering a more competitive market.\n\nIn essence, this ruling marks a crucial moment in the ongoing discourse on big tech's influence over market competition.\n\nAs the case advances through potential appeals and remedy determinations, its outcomes could significantly alter the landscape of online search and digital advertising.\n\nIn short, this impact would affect not just Google but also its competitors and consumers globally.", "source": {"uri": "riotimesonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Rio Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lachlan_williams@riotimesonline.com", "name": "Lachlan Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominance (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDuckGo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DuckDuckGo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Internet_Marketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Internet Marketing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Competitions", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Employment", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.riotimesonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1x-1-8.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

The lawsuit wrapped up nearly a year after the trial between the US Justice Department and Google first began.US District Judge Amit Mehta of the US District Court for the District of Columbia issued the decision after reviewing a year's worth of evidence including testimonies from top executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple. Google and the DOJ presented their closing arguments in early May, AP reported.The ruling is perhaps the biggest antitrust decision of the modern internet era and could fundamentally alter how consumers use the internet. It could also hint at how other antitrust suits will play out against tech giants like Amazon, Apple, and Meta*, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.The US battled Microsoft in a similar antitrust suit during the 1990s.Google is well known for its search engine - so much so that the name of the company has become synonymous for the act of online search. Google's search engine handles about 8.5 billion searches per day across the world which is nearly double that of 12 years ago. The result of the suit will undoubtedly present a major blow to Google which generated nearly $240 billion in revenue last year.Kent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said the company intends to appeal the ruling. The company also faces a separate federal antitrust case over ad technology that will go to trial next month.Meanwhile the Consumer Choice Center, a lobbying group, has accused the US of \"drifting toward the anti-tech posture of the European Union, a part of the world that makes almost nothing and penalizes successful American companies for their popularity.\"*Facebook/Meta is banned in Russia for extremism", "source": {"uri": "sputnikglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sputnik International"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mary_manley@sputnikglobe.com", "name": "Mary Manley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the District of Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/images/sharing/article/eng/1119654995.jpg?10833332311722917530", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

A breakup was reversed on appeal, but key legal findings were upheld. And Microsoft was prohibited from forcing restrictive contracts on its industry partners and ordered to open some of its technology to outsiders -- preventing the company from single-handedly controlling the internet.\n\nMore than two decades later, a ruling in a Google antitrust case similarly promises to shape new rules for the tech industry. Judge Amit P. Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found on Monday that Google had violated antitrust laws by stifling rivals in internet search to protect its monopoly.\n\nGoogle's loss could have major ripple effects for competition today. U.S. regulators have also accused Apple, Amazon and Meta of violating antitrust laws by advantaging their own products on the platforms they run and acquiring smaller rivals. The Google ruling, and potential remedies to be decided by Judge Mehta, are likely to weigh heavily on those cases, including a second lawsuit against Google over ad technology, which is scheduled to go to trial next month.\n\nJudge Mehta's ruling is \"a predictor of what other courts might do,\" said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a Vanderbilt University law professor who studies antitrust. \"You can also expect other judges to read this opinion and be influenced by it.\"\n\nThe influence of the Microsoft antitrust case was, in fact, apparent in the Google decision.

Today's ruling from a federal judge affirms the evidence presented by our bipartisan coalition: Google wields monopoly power over online search. Fair competition ensures a robust, healthy marketplace where the consumer is the priority. Google's unlawful monopoly cripples competition and harms consumers. We will continue holding powerful interests accountable when they engage in unfair, anticompetitive conduct that harms Washingtonians.\"\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Amit P. Mehta today agreed with the attorneys general and the Department of Justice -- which filed a separate but similar lawsuit -- that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act by maintaining a monopoly over its general search and text advertising businesses.\n\nCase background\n\nFerguson joined the bipartisan group of 38 attorneys general to file the lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in December of 2020. The lawsuit asserts that Google and its parent company Alphabet Inc. used exclusionary contracts and unlawful self-preferencing business practices to protect its monopoly, harming consumers, undermining competition and squelching innovation that could threaten its dominance in the market for general internet search and related search text advertising.\n\nGoogle annually provides billions of dollars in financial incentives to pre-install Google Search as the default or exclusive search program on established and emerging internet-connected devices ranging from computers and smart phones to voice-based home speakers and internet-connected vehicles. The bipartisan lawsuit asserts that this is an anticompetitive practice intended to protect Google's monopoly, and, consequently, unlawful.\n\nNearly 90 percent of all internet searches in the United States run through Google's search engine. No other competing search engine has more than 7 percent of the market.\n\nGoogle closely tracks and analyzes virtually every search and click by consumers -- people whom Google's chief economist describes as the \"great unwashed\" -- and then leverages that user data to strengthen its position in the extremely lucrative search-based advertising market.\n\nIn the last decade, Google's revenue from search advertising has grown 300 percent. In 2019, search advertising accounted for $98 billion in revenue for Google -- more than the gross domestic product of 129 countries and the budgets of 46 states, the lawsuit notes.\n\nLosing searches and clicks -- and the opportunity to collect valuable user data -- means losing revenue.\n\nThe judge agreed today with this claim. Ferguson and other attorneys general also alleged claims that that Google's search engine unlawfully drove consumers away from specialized sellers, such as airline ticket sellers, that provide a similar service and that Google unlawfully used its own search advertising management tool to drive advertisers to its platform. The judge did not agree with either of those claims.\n\nFerguson's lawsuit seeks to stop Google's anticompetitive conduct and void any contracts that unlawfully block competitors to Google's services and provide additional relief to restore competition, including, if necessary, requiring the company to divest from portions of its business that facilitate its monopoly.\n\nThe judge will now turn to deciding the consequences Google must face for its actions.\n\n-30-\n\nWashington's Attorney General serves the people and the state of Washington.

The outcome could have major consequences for the tech company.\n\nMore than 90 percent of the online search market is owned by Google. The company has invested billions annually to ensure its search engine is the standard on smartphones and PCs.

In response, Kent Walker, the company's top lawyer, said the court's decision \"recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we should not make it available in the easiest way.\"\n\nThe tech giant also points out that Apple and Mozilla - the most important alternative browser makers after Chrome - rate the search engine as the best.\n\n\"This ruling is a major setback for Google. During the substantive hearing last fall, which lasted ten weeks, the company did everything it could to convince the judges that they were right. There is quite a lot at stake here, the case revolves around the heart of the company: the search engine. Where it all started.\n\nAlthough it is still unclear what adjustments the judge will require, you can assume that this ruling will be read with great concern at head office.

That number has only increased.\n\nIn particular, Google has a major deal with Apple to keep Google the default search engine on Safari, which runs on iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers worldwide.\n\nIn 2020, Google projected that it would lose between 60% and 80% of its search volume on Apple devices if it were replaced as the default general search engine, the filing said. That accounts for between $28.2 billion and $32.7 billion in net revenue losses, it added.\n\n\"Google's distribution agreements are exclusive and have anticompetitive effects,\" Mehta wrote.\n\nEddy Cue, senior vice president of services at Apple, revealed in court documents earlier this year that Google paid $20 billion in 2022 to secure this spot, which amounted to 17.5% of Apple's operating income. So, any remedy that stops or reduces Google's search payments would be bad news for Apple, too.\n\nThe landmark decision on Monday marked the near-conclusion of the DOJ's lawsuit against the search company, which was filed in 2020.\n\nWhat happens next is still unknown, as the ruling did not include remedies.\n\nGoogle's president of global affairs, Kent Walker, told Business Insider in a statement that the company plans to appeal; this could be drawn out for a while longer.\n\nThe ruling will undoubtedly have Google leaders concerned, particularly if remedies include forcing it to break up with Apple.\n\nSome experts previously floated a worst-case scenario for Google where it's barred from bidding for the default position on devices while competitors still can, although this may be an extreme scenario.\n\nEven so, anything that pushes Google out of that default spot on Apple's devices could be very bad news for the search giant -- and it knows it.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hugh_langley@businessinsider.com", "name": "Hugh Langley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firefox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_(computer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mac (computer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_Cue", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eddy Cue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/66b132e4b4912df3ae190938?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

As The Verge points out, this is so far about liabilities, not about any prescriptive remedy. But as one of the major factors in the decision was the payments that Google makes to browser manufacturers, it seems likely that any remedy will change how this works. In turn, the impact across tech could be significant.\n\nApple received $20 billion from Google in 2022 to be the default search engine (it shares 36% of ad revenue from Safari users with the company). That's a big number, but nothing compared to its $394bn in total revenue. But for Mozilla, the impact might be more profound: in 2021, these payments represented 83% of its revenue. What happens to it without this underwriting?\n\nIt's too early to say exactly what will change, but this is also potentially a gift for the new batch of AI startups that are trying to seize search engine ground.

Studies from inside Google itself made it very clear that Google could systematically make Search worse without it affecting user and/or usage numbers in any way, shape, or form - because users have nowhere else to realistically go. While the ability to raise prices at will without fear of losing customers is a sure sign of being a monopoly, so is being able to make a product worse without fear of losing customers, the judge argues.\n\nGoogle plans to appeal, obviously, and this ruling has nothing yet to say about potential remedies, so what, exactly, is going to change is as of yet unknown. Potential remedies will be handled during the next phase of the proceedings, with the wildest and most aggressive remedy being a potential break-up of Google, Alphabet, or whatever it's called today. My sights are definitely set on a break-up - hopefully followed by Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft - to create some much-needed breathing room into the technology market, and pave the way for a massive number of newcomers to compete on much fairer terms.\n\nOf note is that the judge also put yet another nail in the coffin of Google's various exclusivity deals, most notable with Apple and, for our interests, with Mozilla. Google pays Apple well over 20 billion dollars a year to be the default search engine on iOS, and it pays about 80% of Mozilla's revenue to be the default search engine in Firefox. According to the judge, such deals are anticompetitive.\n\nMehta rejected Google's arguments that its contracts with phone and browser makers like Apple were not exclusionary and therefore shouldn't qualify it for liability under the Sherman Act. \"The prospect of losing tens of billions in guaranteed revenue from Google -- which presently come at little to no cost to Apple -- disincentivizes Apple from launching its own search engine when it otherwise has built the capacity to do so,\" he wrote.\n\n\u21ab Lauren Feiner at The Verge\n\nIf the end of these deals become part of the package of remedies, it will be a massive financial blow to Apple - 20 billion dollars a year is about 15% of Apple's total annual operating profits, and I'm also pretty sure those Google billions are counted as part of Tim Cook's much-vaunted services revenue, so losing it would definitely impact Apple directly where it hurts. Sure, it's not like it'll make Apple any less of a dangerous behemoth, but it will definitely have some explaining to do to investors.\n\nMuch more worrisome, however, is the similar deal Google has with Mozilla. About 80% of Mozilla's total revenue comes from a search deal with Google, and if that deal were to be dissolved, the consequences for Mozilla, and thus for Firefox, would be absolutely immense. This is something I've been warning about for years now, and the end of this deal would be yet another worry that I've voiced repeatedly becoming reality, right after Mozilla becoming an advertising company and making Firefox worse in the name of quick profits.\n\nOne by one, every single concern I've voiced about the future of Firefox is becoming reality. Canonical, Fedora, KDE, GNOME, and many other stakeholders - ignore these developments at your own peril.", "source": {"uri": "osnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OSNews: Exploring the Future of Computing"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thom_holwerda@osnews.com", "name": "Thom Holwerda", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sherman Antitrust Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mozilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GNOME"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KDE"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firefox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 84}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

This decision, which follows a lengthy four-year legal process, is expected to be appealed by Google's parent company, Alphabet, indicating that the legal discussions surrounding this case will likely continue for an extended period.\n\nThe U.S. government has expressed the desire for \"structural relief,\" prompting speculation about the potential consequences for the tech giant.\n\nOne of the most extreme remedies being considered is the possibility of requiring Google to divest parts of its business. U.S. officials have not dismissed this option. Google encompasses a wide range of services, including Android and YouTube, both of which have become integral to the tech landscape since their acquisitions. The judge's ruling raises the question of whether such services could remain under the Google umbrella while the search engine itself might operate as a standalone entity.\n\nThis division could lead to challenges for Google executives, but if the search engine continued to be the default option across most devices, users might not observe substantial changes in their everyday experiences.\n\nAnother area under consideration is Google's financial agreements with other tech companies. Currently, Google invests over $10 billion annually, compensating firms like Apple to ensure that its search engine is the default choice on their devices. The court has endorsed this perspective, suggesting that without such financial incentives, competitors might have developed their own search capabilities.\n\nShould these financial agreements be curtailed, it may pave the way for competitors to emerge, although Google's strong brand loyalty presents a significant barrier to consumer shift.\n\nAn alternative remedy could involve the introduction of a selection screen for users opening a browser for the first time, allowing them to choose between Google and other search engines like Microsoft's Bing. However, changing user preference in this way may be difficult, as many users remain satisfied with Google's performance. Historically, despite the emergence of numerous competitors, Google has steadily maintained its dominance in the market.\n\nThe long-standing familiarity and usability of Google has made it a verb in popular language, encapsulating its significant role in everyday searches.\n\nThe outcome of this current situation may not be immediate. A historical parallel can be drawn to Microsoft's legal challenges in the late 1990s when it was similarly accused of monopolistic behavior. Despite an initial ruling to break the company up, appeals led to changes in the final decisions, demonstrating that such cases can take years to resolve.\n\nIn summary, as this case progresses through the appellate system, the future of Google's operations could change significantly, but any substantial transformation is likely to unfold over an extended timeframe.", "source": {"uri": "theglobalherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Global Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 63}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

The US Department of Justice's nearly year-long case against Google over its dominance in the search engine market has reached a dramatic end. The case could drastically alter how numerous devices and web browsers choose their default search engines, though the full extent of the impending effects remains unclear.\n\nA US judge has ruled that Google's massive payments to various tech companies in exchange for favoring its search engine constitute an illegal monopoly. The company was determined to have exploited its market dominance to gain an unfair advantage over the competition.\n\nThe scale of Google's payments to maintain exclusivity agreements emerged after the Department of Justice opened its case against the company last September. Google paid companies like Apple, Samsung, and Mozilla a share of advertising revenue from its search engine to ensure that it remained the default on Apple devices, Android phones, and numerous web browsers. In 2021 alone, the payments exceeded $21 billion.\n\nMost of the amount, around $19 billion, went to Apple in exchange for making iPhones, iPads, and Macs default to Google upon initial setup. Other recipients included Samsung, LG, Motorola, AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Mozilla, Opera, and UCWeb.\n\nThe judge's opinion claims that the policy made it harder for alternative search engines like Bing or DuckDuckGo to gain a foothold among users. The opinion directly compared Google's behavior to the infamous late 1990s case involving Microsoft's interference in the then-emerging web browser market.\n\nIn its defense, Google argued that its search engine is simply the best (though many users might disagree these days). Moreover, users can switch to different default search engines.\n\nStatements from early in the trial also revealed that Apple felt it had no viable alternative, as Microsoft's Bing - the next-largest search engine - controlled less than 10 percent of the market. Apple briefly considered acquiring Bing but ultimately used the prospect of the deal to convince Google to increase its payments.\n\nThe judge's opinion acknowledged the engineering prowess required for the company to attain its dominance. Still, the judge also noted that Google couldn't satisfactorily explain why the payments were necessary. The company's policy of disabling chat history and deleting logs also hurt its defense by drawing accusations of a coverup from the DOJ.\n\nGoogle's defeat in the case could have huge implications for how devices and browsers interact with search engines going forward.", "source": {"uri": "techspot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechSpot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_sims@techspot.com", "name": "Daniel Sims", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mozilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_(computer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mac (computer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LG Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motorola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Verizon Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AT&T"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDuckGo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DuckDuckGo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Internet_Marketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Internet Marketing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.techspot.com/images2/news/bigimage/2024/06/2024-06-26-image-6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

One possible outcome is that users will be given more prominent choices for default search engines, reducing Google's control over default placements. This could lead to a substantial decrease in the revenue Mozilla receives from Google. Without Google's financial support, Mozilla might struggle to maintain its current level of operations, development, and innovation.\n\nMozilla Firefox is heavily reliant on Google. Whenever a user types a search query into Firefox, it is Google's search engine that powers the results. This arrangement is the backbone of Mozilla's finances. In fact, Google's search payments accounted for a staggering 86% of Mozilla's total revenue in 2021-2022 ($510 million out of $593 million). Losing this massive income stream would pose a severe financial crisis for the organization known for privacy and open web standards.\n\nIn light of the ruling, a Mozilla spokesperson told Fortune, \"Mozilla has always championed competition and choice online, particularly in search.\" \"We're closely reviewing the court's decision, considering its potential impact on Mozilla and how we can positively influence the next steps... Firefox continues to offer a range of search options, and we remain committed to serving our users' preferences while fostering a competitive market.\"\n\nJudge Mehta's ruling is a significant victory for the Department of Justice (DOJ), which accused Google of illegally monopolizing the online search market. However, not all government arguments were accepted by Mehta. He dismissed claims that Google holds monopoly power in certain parts of the ads market but agreed that it does have a monopoly in \"general search services\" and \"general search text advertising.\"\n\nThe exact implications of this ruling for Google's business are yet to be determined, as the initial finding only pertains to the company's liability, not remedies. The next phase of proceedings could result in anything from a mandate to stop certain business practices to a breakup of Google's search business.

But at least for now, it's a bigger deal in what it symbolizes rather than what it's going to change. This feels like the culmination of years of building \"techlash\" - first by non-\"Big Tech\" companies and increasingly by the government (and governments around the world). Sure, there are pockets of end users, in particular those who feel tech platforms marginalize them or muffle their voices, but for the most part, people seem to still love these companies and products. So it's a sort of weird dichotomy.\n\nIn terms of timing, while most parallels to Microsoft's antitrust case 25 years ago don't make a ton of sense here - that's a longer post - the structure of this all feels like it could play out similarly. The ruling against Microsoft came down in April 2000 (after a \"finding of fact\" in November 1999). The proposed remedy actually came pretty quickly: in June 2000, with the judge saying that Microsoft should be split into two companies, one for operating systems and one for other software.\n\nThat, of course, never happened. The appeals were immediate, as they will be here. In July 2001, a Circuit Court overturned the ruling, but on a technicality (the judge talking to the media). It upheld the findings of fact about the monopoly but the demand the company be broken up as the remedy was effectively over. A few months later, Microsoft settled. But even that settlement wasn't finalized until 2004, after various challenges by individual states.\n\nSo that's just over four years from the ruling to the actual case being over after the appeals and settlement. Obviously this case won't play out the exact same way - presumably the judge was on media lockdown this time! - but still, the timeline is likely to be years. Unless Google finds a way to settle earlier, in a way they determine won't destroy their business. The likelihood of that won't be clear until we get the proposed remedies.\n\nThe ones being thrown out there today range from break-ups/split-ups of various Google properties (selling Chrome, splitting off Android, etc), to far more nuanced tweaks to the business. This opinion today in Bloomberg Law by antitrust economist Tessie LiJu Su feels the most correct right now, at least directionally:\n\nEnjoining Google from the alleged bundling and revenue sharing practices is probably the best remedy. Android phone makers will no longer be required to use Google Search as default on their devices in order to license its intellectual property. Nor will they or Apple be induced by financial gains when Google's revenue sharing stops. This approach will open up distribution to rival search engines.\n\nThe device manufacturers would be free to design their own products. They would balance the competition in the mobile device market with the potential stream of search and revenue they are now in a position to generate. If consumers desire choice screens they would provide them. However, they are more likely to offer their own search engines as default.\n\nThis would effectively be telling Google to put their mouth where their money currently is - i.e. backing up the notion that their search product is the best without paying to place it everywhere.\n\nThe Apple element of this is arguably just as interesting as the Google element, because as everyone is well aware by now, a massive percentage of Apple's now-all-important Services business - not to mention overall profit - is their search deal with Google. To the tune of $20B+ a year.\n\nBut the Occam's razor read of such a remedy would perhaps not change the status quo all that much. Because it wouldn't dictate that Android phone makers or Apple make another search engine the default, it would likely instead lead to more pop-ups asking people to explicitly make a choice. And Google would still have a huge market advantage there, simply thanks to brand awareness, if nothing else. And if companies were allowed to bid on placement in such a screen, the effect would likely be even more muted.\n\nIn the above scenario, it may hurt Apple more than Google because of that lump-sum payment. There would still undoubtedly be revenue share for search, but it would perhaps be less massive and certainly more lumpy. And yes, Mozilla might be in more trouble than they already are as well in such a world because the revenue would be less constant and predictable, and possibly just less.\n\nAnyway, those are some quick thoughts. Mainly, I go back to the notion that this is a far bigger deal optically right now than anything else. The knives have long been out for \"Big Tech\" and this is their biggest puncture wound yet (as opposed to the EU, which often seems to be stabbing with spoons while blindfolded). And this certainly doesn't portend well for all the other outstanding cases against Big Tech.\n\nHere's where I'll note that while I was technically a Google employee for the past decade-plus, being a partner at the venture arm kept us pretty far removed from such big company matters. Still, these opinions are my own, of course.\n\nThat includes the other case against Google for the ad business, though the judge's comments here on that business may actually help Google in that case.", "source": {"uri": "spyglass.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spyglass"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States v.

Still, the decision will likely carry a lot of consequences for the internet industry.\n\nWhat happened: Judge Amit Mehta of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia sided with the Justice Department and several states that had accused Google of illegally cementing its search dominance. In large part that was by paying billions each year to companies including Apple and Samsung to make Google the default search engine on their devices. (Apple alone received $20 billion in 2022.)\n\nThose agreements hurt competition, Mehta found, allowing Google to trample competitors. That dominance -- 94.9 percent of the general search market -- then allowed the company to inflate the prices for some search ads, giving it more money to pay Apple and others, he wrote.\n\nIt's hard to overstate the importance of search to Google's business: The operation represented more than half of the company's $74.6 billion in total revenue for the second quarter.\n\nWhat comes next? Mehta, a President Obama appointee, set a hearing for Sept. 6 to begin discussing potential remedies. The big question is whether the government will push for divestitures (a structural remedy, in antitrust parlance) or some form of operational fix.\n\nGoogle, for its part, plans to appeal.\n\nCould a Trump victory help Google? There is precedent: In 2001, the Justice Department under newly elected President George W. Bush changed course in the federal government's antitrust fight against Microsoft, pursuing a settlement with the tech giant instead of a breakup. The decision came months after a federal appeals court had overturned a lower court's order to break up Microsoft.\n\nBut the politics now are complicated. Vice President Kamala Harris's views on antitrust are unknown. And Donald Trump hasn't exactly been friendly to Google. (Remember that this case began under his presidency.) His running mate, Senator JD Vance, has supported a crackdown on Big Tech.\n\nRegardless of who wins in November, Google must also contend with the states that also had signed onto the lawsuit. They have no obligation to follow the Justice Department.\n\nWhat will this mean for Apple? The ruling threatens to alter one of Apple's most lucrative business arrangements. Would Apple look to Microsoft's Bing or someone else to power search on the iPhone?\n\nOr, as it did with maps, would Apple enter the market itself? Bloomberg notes that the company's plans to integrate ChatGPT and other chatbots with Siri could soften the ruling's blow.\n\nWill this decision bolster other fights against Big Tech? Some experts told The Times that it could help antitrust lawsuits against the likes of Amazon, Apple and Meta.\n\nBut others questioned how transformative the ruling really was. \"There's nothing new here that we are changing antitrust law,\" Doug Melamed, a professor of law at Stanford and a former Justice Department official, told DealBook.\n\nAnticipation builds for Kamala Harris's choice of running mate. The vice president, who officially claimed the Democratic presidential nomination, is expected to reveal her choice on Tuesday, capping a 16-day sprint to vet candidates amid pressure from donors and interest groups. The duo are scheduled to campaign in Philadelphia later on Tuesday.\n\nA trio of OpenAI leaders step away. John Schulman, who oversees a key safety team at the ChatGPT maker, is decamping for a major rival, Anthropic, while Greg Brockman, a close ally of Sam Altman, is taking an extended leave of absence; Peter Deng, a senior product leader, is leaving as well. The moves come amid a wave of turnovers at the high-flying A.I. start-up.\n\nThe Treasury Department is accused of juicing the economy. Republican lawmakers and the economists Nouriel Roubini and Stephen Miran argued that the department was seeking to manipulate the bond market, to boost the government's finances. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has pushed back against the accusation. (Scheduled for Wednesday: a closely watched auction of 10-year Treasury notes.)\n\nNvidia's C.E.O. sells roughly $500 million worth of stock this summer. Jensen Huang, who co-founded the chipmaker at the center of the artificial intelligence boom, sold a record $323 million via a prearranged transaction last month. Nvidia's stock has more than doubled in the past year, but investor concerns about whether hefty spending by tech companies on A.I. was sustainable have weighed on the sector.\n\nGlobal markets are bouncing back on Tuesday, as investors return to risky assets, including tech stocks and crypto, that have taken a pounding recently.\n\nBut Tuesday's gains haven't made up for Monday's $1 trillion wipeout. And concerns about a U.S. economic slowdown haven't gone away.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nThe turmoil raises more questions about the Fed's next move. The futures market on Tuesday was penciling in about a full percentage point worth of Fed interest rate cuts by year's end. That would suggest at least one outsize cut of a half percentage point in one of the three remaining meetings of its rate-setting committee.\n\nTwo regional Fed presidents, Mary Daly of San Francisco and Austan Goolsbee of Chicago, said on Monday to expect cuts, but reiterated that the central bank is still watching the data closely before it acts. That chilled speculation of an emergency inter-meeting cut.\n\nThe market move may have political implications. Donald Trump, who has long fixated on market performance as a measure of economic health, sought to use Monday's sell-off to criticize the Democrats' handling of the economy. (But Fox News's Neil Cavuto noted that some of the biggest market plunges in recent years happened on his watch.)\n\nDoes the stock market actually influence elections? It's a data point worth watching, Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, told DealBook. The S&P 500's performance during the three months before Election Day -- this year, that would mean from Monday -- has often correlated to which party wins. Here are the numbers:\n\nTurnquist likens this S&P 500 gauge to political polls. \"This is intuitive in the sense that this is what the markets are looking at,\" he said.\n\n-- Mike Moritz, the veteran venture capitalist, cautioning peers in the tech industry who have endorsed Donald Trump.\n\nElon Musk's decision to endorse, and raise money for, Donald Trump has made the billionaire a potential kingmaker in the presidential race.\n\nBut it also made him a focal point in an increasingly politically divided Silicon Valley, and is attracting more scrutiny regarding his potential influence in the election and beyond.\n\nSeveral state officials are looking into different Musk operations:\n\nBoth are reminders of Musk's reach, and his unusual outspokenness. Most tech C.E.O.s are staying politically neutral on the election -- aside from Mark Zuckerberg of Meta calling Trump's post-shooting fist pump \"one of the most badass things\" he had ever seen. That's in part because they don't want to draw fire for being seen as putting their thumbs on the political scales.\n\nSuch concerns haven't bothered Musk, even though his ownership of X -- and nearly 130 million followers -- gives him a big megaphone. He has been accused of promoting misinformation and stoking division on the platform before, including by boosting a digitally altered video of Harris.\n\nThese battles aren't only happening in the U.S. A representative for Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Britain criticized Musk for saying civil war in that country was \"inevitable\" amid an outbreak of race riots there. (British leaders and experts have blamed disinformation online for fomenting much of the violence.)\n\nMusk fought back, replying to Starmer, \"Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?\" That spat comes as X faces a potentially big fine by the E.U. for failing to police disinformation on the platform.\n\nWe'd like your feedback!

It's Widely Used Because It's the Best | Opinion", "body": "On Monday, a federal judge ruled that Google violated antitrust law and acted illegally in order to maintain its monopoly in online searches. There's just one glaring problem: Google isn't a monopoly -- not even close.\n\nIn fact, there are over 30 other search engines in the world that are dedicated solely to search functionality, including Yahoo!, Bing, and Duck, Duck, Go. Additionally, websites like Amazon, TikTok, and Pinterest have placed increasing competition on Google in recent years as consumers have begun using these websites for all manner of searches, from products to DIY tutorials to medical advice.\n\nThe ruling marks the first antitrust decision in the modern tech era, and its implications could be far-reaching for our legal framework, our economy, and consumers.\n\nIn the case, the U.S. Justice Department argued that Google acted in an anti-competitive nature by securing agreements with companies like Apple and Samsung that ensured their browsers were auto-downloaded to their devices. They also argued that over 90 percent of web searches are conducted on Google's search engines.\n\nIn reality, consumers have always had the ability to download their preferred search engines to their phones or delete the apps that come pre-programed to their devices. In securing these deals, Google did not block other search engines from being accessible, nor did they force anyone to use their products. They just made them more convenient to access, which is a perfectly reasonable step for a business to take.\n\nGoogle disputes the claim that 90 percent of web searches are done on their engines. But even if they were, the company's popularity indicates one thing and one thing alone: Consumers like Google products and want to use them. The company has in no way harmed consumers, defrauded anyone, or even acted in an unfair way toward their competition. Being smart enough to negotiate such deals simply makes Google better at its job.\n\nFor decades, antitrust law has hinged on conservative legal jurisprudence known as the consumer welfare standard. It's a very good legal precedent that defenders of capitalism and limited government worked hard to enshrine into law following a disastrous period of aggressive antitrust pursuits by the U.S. government in the 20th century that crippled our economy.\n\nThe consumer welfare standard says that in order to have breached antitrust law, three conditions must be met. The company in question must be a monopoly (an extreme rarity), it must have used its monopoly power, and it must have done so in a way that harms consumers. No serious person could argue Google crossed any one of these lines, much less all three.\n\nYet the case against Google is one of many the FTC has launched in the past few years under the aggressive and anti-capitalist reign of chair Lina Khan. Khan's agenda, which has been supported by the Biden administration and populists in both parties such as Senators Elizabeth Warren and Josh Hawley, seeks to overturn the consumer welfare standard and return our antitrust landscape to that of the mid-1900s. According to these types, a business being big means it is bad, rather than the obvious truth that a business becoming big merely means it is popular and offers a product or service consumers quite like. And their solution to \"bad\" big business is always the same: The government needs more control of the economy and private companies in order to \"protect\" consumers from these evil corporations.\n\nBut antitrust enthusiasts always tip their hand, revealing antitrust as a Trojan horse: The same people who openly hate capitalism are always claiming we need more of it in order to \"save\" capitalism. But capitalism doesn't need saving by the government, certainly not from monopolies. In a true free market, system failures come naturally and swiftly as better competitors emerge, products become outdated, or bloat takes over. Monopolies rarely exist at all and never for long under capitalism.\n\nDespite the fact that our economy is more mixed than free market these days, supporters of antitrust are still hard-pressed to identify actual monopolies in existence. In fact, the only long-standing monopolies that come to mind are government created or backed (think the public school system or certificate of need laws that block the infusion of new healthcare suppliers).\n\nGoogle lost its lawsuit, but the real losers are the American people. Not only could this decision prohibit Google from offering quality products millions of us enjoy, it also means it will be even harder for the next competitor to get their foot in the door.\n\nHannah Cox is the President and Co-Founder of BASEDPolitics.

Mehta, the judge presiding over the trial, ruled that the tech giant has illegally maintained a monopoly through the billions of dollars in annual payments it makes to partners to secure the default search engine position on popular web browsers and mobile phones. With those dominant positions locked in, the argument goes, other competitors in the search and search advertising businesses have no chance of competing effectively.\n\nThe ruling immediately prompted speculation about the impact to Apple, which receives as much as $20 billion from Google every year in exchange for putting the search engine front-and-center on its iPhones via the Apple Safari web browser.\n\nBut while Apple would certainly take a big hit if the ruling is upheld, Apple is a large, diversified company with many sources of revenue. That's not the case for another partner of Google's located in the fallout zone of Monday's ruling: Mozilla, the non-profit tech org that makes the Firefox web browser.\n\nWhen users of Firefox type a search term into the browser, the query is automatically routed to Google's search engine. The arrangement is vital for Mozilla. According to the Mozilla Foundation's 2021-2022 financial statement, which is the most recent published, $510 million out of its $593 million in revenue came courtesy of Google's search payments.\n\nIf that number $510 million were to go away entirely, Mozilla will have a serious problem on its hands.\n\nMozilla is putting on a brave face for now, and not directly addressing the existential threat that the ruling appears to pose.\n\n\"Mozilla has always championed competition and choice online, particularly in search,\" a spokesperson said in a statement to Fortune on Monday. \"We're closely reviewing the court's decision, considering its potential impact on Mozilla and how we can positively influence the next steps...Firefox continues to offer a range of search options, and we remain committed to serving our users' preferences while fostering a competitive market.\"\n\nFor Mozilla, which first rose to prominence in the late 1990s as a community-driven project to challenge Microsoft's stranglehold on the web browser market via Internet Explorer, Monday's ruling is the latest setback in a quest to find relevance in a market dominated by Big Tech companies. Mozilla laid off about 60 staffers earlier this year and saw its CEO step down.\n\nYou can be sure that critics of the judge's ruling will highlight the potentially devastating impact on Mozilla to make the case that the antitrust ruling will have unintended consequences on smaller tech industry players. Others might argue that Mozilla hasn't done enough with those spoils to differentiate its Firefox browser, or that it could cut a deal with another search engine like Bing if its Google deal goes away completely.\n\nEither way, Google will appeal the suit so a long battle may ensue. And there's another big domino to fall: the judge will rule on the remedy or remedies -- essentially, the business-model penalties -- that Google will face.\n\nEvercore ISI research analyst Mark Mahoney tacked them off in a research note on Monday evening:\n\n\"The exact remedy is key, and so far, it's hard to pick a winning horse among a range of outcomes,\" he wrote. \" i) forbidding payment from Google altogether, ii) a cap on the amount of distribution agreement fees, iii) pushing Apple to implement a \"choice screen\", or iv) something else? In any case, we expect at least another 6 months to a year before we would know the exact remedies (or longer if the judge decides to stay the remedies phase pending GOOG's appeal).\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

District Court ruled today that Google violated the Sherman Act by buying its way onto browsers and devices and making it nearly impossible to avoid its search engine.\n\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Judge Mehta wrote in his 286-page ruling. \"It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.\"\n\nThe decision in the first major monopolization case in 25 years is a big win for the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, and reinforces the aggressive antitrust policies of the Biden administration. It shows that, in fact, law enforcers claiming that there was a new era of entrenchment and consolidation in the U.S. economy got it right.\n\nThe ruling has major implications for future developments in the tech industry, as the companies that dominated Web 2.0's platform era are working to do the same thing with artificial intelligence.

Google paid billions per year to keep these agreements in effect.\n\nGoogle also used its dominance of the search advertising market to fend off challenges from Microsoft, one of its chief competitors, Mehta ruled. However, he stopped short of saying Google has a monopoly over search advertising.\n\nIt remains unclear what methods the government will pursue to rectify Google's search monopoly. That will require separate legal proceedings. But Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Jonathan Kanter has voiced support for \"structural remedies\" that could include breaking off parts of Google's business.\n\nGoogle plans to appeal the ruling.\n\nBut the decision will no doubt bolster related efforts to crack down on Big Tech monopolies, since it proves existing antitrust law applies in the internet era. Next up is another Google trial centering on its programmatic ad tech, which is set to begin in September. The US also has pending antitrust cases against Apple, Meta and Amazon.\n\nScrape, Baby, Scrape\n\nInternal documents leaked to 404 Media reveal that Nvidia has been scraping video content from YouTube, Netflix and other digital sources to train its AI.\n\nDescribed as \"a video data factory that can yield a human lifetime visual experience worth of training data per day\" by an Nvidia higher-up, the \"Cosmos\" project was intended as a foundational AI model for several products, including even self-driving car systems.\n\nObviously this reopens previous ethical and legal arguments about downloading and using copyrighted content in AI training data sets (YouTube calls this type of scraping a \"clear violation\" of its terms of use), but it also begs the question: Can we trust AI companies when they say their products are compliant with copyright laws?\n\nAs this newsletter previously covered, many advertising agencies are still hesitant to use AI tools without first confirming that their own data will not be used as a training source. More negative press like this won't exactly inspire confidence in these tools going forward - to say nothing of the many lawsuits now being filed against AI companies, Nvidia included.\n\nDitto\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery's flagship service Max just launched a new homepage personalization feature for all US accounts. WBD started rolling it out gradually in December - and it's awfully similar to the content recommendation setup on Netflix, The Verge reports.\n\nBased on viewing history and consumption patterns, Max now recommends titles in content rows that take over the entire homepage, not just part of it. Max also suppresses titles it doesn't think a subscriber would be interested in.\n\nHomepage personalization is one tactic streamers are using to increase time spent on their apps, which can raise ad revenue. But another popular strategy for streamers like Max is copying Netflix, which is steadily growing both ad-supported subscribers and ad revenue.\n\nShortly after Netflix touted all the paid accounts it gained from banning password sharing, for example, Max (and Disney+) announced plans to do the same. And going forward, WBD plans to include more features on Max that encourage user engagement, such as buttons viewers can use to rank the shows they \"like\" or \"love\" - which Netflix has been doing for at least two years.\n\nBut Wait, There's More!\n\nAri Paparo offers a history lesson on how Google built an ads business that's drawing antitrust scrutiny.

While we once admired Google's innovative spirit, particularly during the early days of Android, their dominance in search has created significant challenges for small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nGoogle's frequent algorithm changes and core updates have made it increasingly difficult for smaller companies to compete with large corporations in search results. This constant shifting of goalposts has turned SEO into a resource-intensive game, where only those with substantial means can truly compete. As a result, many small businesses find themselves at a severe disadvantage, unable to afford the teams of experts needed to keep pace with these changes.\n\nThe consequences of this imbalance are far-reaching and very real. Businesses may fail, jobs may be lost, and families may face financial hardship - all because of changes in search algorithms that favor larger, more resourced entities. This power dynamic has effectively transformed the internet into what some might call a \"Googlenet,\" where one company wields enormous influence over online visibility and, by extension, business success.\n\nWe believe this ruling is a crucial step toward creating a more equitable digital landscape. It's imperative that regulations be implemented to prevent any single entity from having such disproportionate control over the online ecosystem. The goal should be to foster fair competition and ensure that businesses of all sizes have a reasonable opportunity to be discovered online.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that Google has contributed significantly to the development of the Internet, we hope this decision will lead to positive changes in the search industry. These changes should benefit not only businesses but also consumers, by promoting diversity in search results and encouraging innovation across the digital space.", "source": {"uri": "androidheadlines.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Android Headlines"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kristijan_lucic@androidheadlines.com", "name": "Kristijan Lucic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium-sized_enterprises", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Small and medium-sized enterprises"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Search engine optimization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Small business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www.androidheadlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AH-Google-Anti-Trust-Lawsuit-Gavel-Decision-.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

Judged by the same legal yardstick, Alphabet's web search colossus is a monopolist just as the software developer was deemed to be in 2001. It might also suffer a similar fate.\n\nRegardless of the remedies, which will be determined later, the victory is a significant one for Jonathan Kanter, the U.S. Department of Justice antitrust chief, and his counterpart at the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan. Both have filed a panoply of lawsuits against tech giants, and the findings in this case will be an important signal to courts presiding over the others, including another one against Google's ad-tech business.\n\nMehta's opinion also finesses the uncomfortable finding that Google is the \"highest quality search engine.\" Resources play a part. Google estimated that Apple would need to spend $20 billion to build a similar product and billions more to operate it. The primary concern, however, is establishing ubiquity. In 2022, Google paid about $20 billion to be the default option for iPhone buyers, according to the ruling.\n\nSupport MacDailyNews at no extra cost to you by using this link to shop at Amazon.\n\n\u200e\n\nMacDailyNews Take: This is a decade or so too late, but at least it's finally happening!\n\nAs regular readers know, we've been talking about this issue for years, as ad revenue dwindled - yet Alphabet/Google magically got richer. We've all lost many great sites over recent years as the Google-dominated broken ad-supported model failed. This is the very reason why there are too many ads on the site (cluttered is better than dead).\n\nCandidly, it may be too late for us (but, for now, we're still trying to survive). This will take many years to be rectified and for the once-vibrant digital advertising model to begin working again for publishers, if it ever happens. If you can contribute a couple buck monthly help keep our very independent Apple-focused blog afloat, you can do so here. Thank you in advance!\n\nEven as we attempt to move away from the ad-supported model, we back whatever remedy or remedies will introduce competition back into the online advertising business, which is broken, in part, because far too much power is concentrated with Google/Facebook. This situation is exactly why antitrust laws exist. -- MacDailyNews, February 2, 2021\n\nImagine if your livelihood depended on one company that had not only monopolized web search (and, thereby, basically controlled how new customers find you), but also controlled the bulk of online advertising dollars which funded your business and which they could pull, simply threaten to pull, or reduce rates at any time? Now also imagine if you believe this monopolist basically stole the product of another company that is the very subject of your business? How much would you criticize the monopolist thief's business practices?\n\nYou might guess that it would be a tough road to walk. (We're only imagining, of course!)\n\nThat would be a good example of why monopolies are bad for everyone...\n\nIn the meantime, stop using Google search and Google products wherever possible. Monopolies are bad for everyone. -- MacDailyNews, July 14, 2016\n\nIf you haven't already, give DuckDuckGo a try! https://duckduckgo.com\n\nWith this unprecedented power, platforms have the ability to redirect into their pockets the advertising dollars that once went to newspapers and magazines. No one company should have the power to pick and choose which content reaches consumers and which doesn't. -- MacDailyNews, November 9, 2017\n\nWe'd like to see real competition in the online search and advertising markets restored someday. -- MacDailyNews, March 20, 2019\n\n\u200e\n\nPlease help support MacDailyNews.

This situation is exactly why antitrust laws exist. - MacDailyNews, February 2, 2021\n\nGoogle is an online advertising monopoly masquerading as a search engine. Effective antitrust action against Google that restores competition into the the online search and advertising markets would be very welcome (while we're still here, please)!\n\nThe unfortunately ubiquitous search engine is a mechanism for tracking users in order to deliver targeted advertising to them.\n\nIf you haven't already, give DuckDuckGo a try today (https://duckduckgo.com) or even Bing.

No one company should have the power to pick and choose which content reaches consumers and which doesn't. -- MacDailyNews, November 9, 2017\n\nImagine if your livelihood depended on one company that had not only monopolized web search (and, thereby, basically controlled how new customers find you), but also controlled the bulk of online advertising dollars which funded your business and which they could pull, simply threaten to pull, or reduce rates at any time? Now also imagine if you believe this monopolist basically stole the product of another company that is the very subject of your business? How much would you criticize the monopolist thief's business practices?\n\nYou might guess that it would be a tough road to walk. (We're only imagining, of course!)\n\nThat would be a good example of why monopolies are bad for everyone...\n\nIn the meantime, stop using Google search and Google products wherever possible.

With those dominant positions locked in, the argument goes, other competitors in the search and search advertising businesses have no chance of competing effectively.\n\nThe ruling immediately prompted speculation about the impact to Apple, which receives as much as US$20bil (RM88.96bil) from Google every year in exchange for putting the search engine front-and-centre on its iPhones via the Apple Safari web browser.\n\nBut while Apple would certainly take a big hit if the ruling is upheld, Apple is a large, diversified company with many sources of revenue. That's not the case for another partner of Google's located in the fallout zone of Monday's ruling: Mozilla, the non-profit tech organisation that makes the Firefox web browser.\n\nWhen users of Firefox type a search term into the browser, the query is automatically routed to Google's search engine. The arrangement is vital for Mozilla. According to the Mozilla Foundation's 2021-2022 financial statement, which is the most recent published, US$510mil (RM2.26bil) out of its US$593mil (RM2.63bil) in revenue came courtesy of Google's search payments.\n\nIf that number US$510mil (RM2.26bil) were to go away entirely, Mozilla will have a serious problem on its hands.\n\nMozilla is putting on a brave face for now, and not directly addressing the existential threat that the ruling appears to pose.\n\n\"Mozilla has always championed competition and choice online, particularly in search,\" a spokesperson said in a statement to Fortune on Monday. \"We're closely reviewing the court's decision, considering its potential impact on Mozilla and how we can positively influence the next steps... Firefox continues to offer a range of search options, and we remain committed to serving our users' preferences while fostering a competitive market.\"\n\nFor Mozilla, which first rose to prominence in the late 1990s as a community-driven project to challenge Microsoft's stranglehold on the web browser market via Internet Explorer, Monday's ruling is the latest setback in a quest to find relevance in a market dominated by Big Tech companies. Mozilla laid off about 60 staffers earlier this year and saw its CEO step down.\n\nYou can be sure that critics of the judge's ruling will highlight the potentially devastating impact on Mozilla to make the case that the antitrust ruling will have unintended consequences on smaller tech industry players. Others might argue that Mozilla hasn't done enough with those spoils to differentiate its Firefox browser, or that it could cut a deal with another search engine like Bing if its Google deal goes away completely.\n\nEither way, Google will appeal the suit so a long battle may ensue. And there's another big domino to fall: the judge will rule on the remedy or remedies - essentially, the business-model penalties - that Google will face.\n\nEvercore ISI research analyst Mark Mahoney tacked them off in a research note on Monday evening: \"The exact remedy is key, and so far, it's hard to pick a winning horse among a range of outcomes,\" he wrote. \"i) forbidding payment from Google altogether, ii) a cap on the amount of distribution agreement fees, iii) pushing Apple to implement a \"choice screen\", or iv) something else? In any case, we expect at least another 6 months to a year before we would know the exact remedies (or longer if the judge decides to stay the remedies phase pending GOOG's appeal).\" - Fortune.com/The New York Times", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mozilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Firefox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mozilla Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fortune (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet Explorer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2024/08/06/2843246.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

I'm Bill Thomas, we have some really pressing stories to share with you today, and here's what's going on.\n\nThe central bank is prepared to step in if the economy gets much worse, a federal judge rules against Google in a landmark antitrust case, and Johns Hopkins University is ordered to pay out millions more in a class action lawsuit. Also, former President Donald Trump faces a couple of legal setbacks, and a man who wants to be president says he's the guy behind the mystery of a dead bear cub.\n\nData that came out last week showed deterioration in the U.S. labor market and manufacturing. The data included an 11-month high in initial jobless filings, with job creation numbers that came in well below expectations, and an unemployment rate that jumped higher than anticipated.\n\nMarket reaction was immediate, with stocks and other risky assets selling off, but recent news sparked further panic when the VIX, the volatility index, jumped to its highest level since the COVID-19 pandemic. The VIX is a measure of stock market volatility, and that's what caused the markets to drop even further.\n\nAustan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, told CNBC that the Fed is always prepared to respond if the situation deteriorates, and that their job is to stabilize prices and maximize employment. Goolsbee also went on to warn market watchers not to jump to conclusions from a single jobs report, especially when the job creation number was roughly equivalent to the margin of error.\n\nWhen asked whether he sees any other indicators besides last week's negative manufacturing data and labor market challenges, Goolsbee pointed to the rise in consumer delinquencies and an uptick in small business defaults.\n\nBut, on the flip side, he said that the gross domestic product (GDP) data has come in quite strong, indicating economic growth at a \"fairly steady level.\"\n\nGoolsbee's remarks follow Wall Street's main indexes, which as you know, tanked yesterday, as fears of a nationwide recession rippled through the global markets.\n\nThe ruling, issued by Judge Amit Mehta, ends a years-long legal battle initiated by the U.S. Department of Justice and a coalition of state attorneys general.\n\nMehta's decision states that after having carefully considered and weighed witness testimony and evidence, the court has decided that Google is a monopolist and has violated Section 2 of what's called the Sherman Act.\n\nThe case against Google, which was filed in October 2020, alleged that the tech giant engaged in anti-competitive practices by establishing exclusive agreements with browser developers, mobile device manufacturers, and wireless carriers.\n\nSo you know, those agreements prevented partners from pre-installing rival search engines, leading most U.S. devices to come preloaded exclusively with Google, forcing competitors to find alternative ways to reach users.\n\nThe court said Google's conduct allowed the company to charge companies with what's legally described as \"supracompetitive prices for general search text ads,\" enabling them to earn substantial monopoly profits.\n\nIn defense, Google said that its practices were pro-competitive and justified by the quality of its services.\n\nGoogle said it plans to appeal and that \"this decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn't be allowed to make it easily available.\n\nThe judge's ruling suggests the possibility of structural relief as a remedy, which would involve changes to Google's business operations, including terminating exclusive agreements that make Google's search engine the default option.\n\nYou should know that this case is seen as the most significant antitrust trial of the century, and antitrust lawsuits have also been filed against other big tech companies, including Amazon, Meta, and Apple.\n\nLast week, U.S. District Judge Julie Rubin signed the order after the university and plaintiffs, led by a former student, said they found more than 2,600 students who paid for the 2020 spring semester but did not receive refunds. By the way, court documents state that tuition fees for a semester at that time cost at least $26,150.\n\nNearly 11,000 students or former students have already received or are awaiting payouts from the fund. The amount each person receives depends on a variety of factors, including how much they paid in tuition, along with payments through student loans. Scholarships are exempt from refunds.\n\nJohns Hopkins was ordered to deposit the money into the settlement fund before the end of the year. The school was previously ordered to pay about $8 million into that same fund.\n\nInteresting to note that in addition to the $10 million being paid to students and former students, the university was also ordered to pay $2.2 million to attorneys representing the plaintiffs.\n\nMissouri's Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition weeks ago to the high court, arguing that the New York case infringed on the rights of voters and electors in his state ahead of the election. Bailey also added the case was meant to smear the former president. As you know, Trump is the Republican Party's nominee for president in the general election, which is just a few months away.\n\nBy the way, while Bailey contended that the conviction would likely be overturned on appeal, he added that the constraints that New York put on Trump would \"limit his ability to campaign.\"\n\nTo refresh your memory, Trump was found guilty in May for falsifying business records to cover up a $130,000 payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels at the end of the 2016 election. Prosecutors said the payment was intended to bolster his presidential campaign at that time.\n\nInteresting to note that New York Attorney General Letitia James wrote that Missouri does not have legal standing to challenge the Trump case.\n\nYou should know that Trump is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 18.\n\nIn a video posted on his X account on Sunday, the 70-year-old independent presidential candidate recounted the highly unusual circumstances that stumped the city for the past decade.\n\nAccording to Kennedy, he was driving through New York's Hudson Valley early one morning in 2014 on a falconry trip with a group of friends when a driver in front of him hit a bear cub, killing it. He says he picked up the bear and put it in the back of his van, with the intention of skinning it and saving the meat in his freezer for food.\n\nKennedy said that New York state law allows taking home a roadkill bear, but only after notifying law enforcement or the state's environment authority and getting a special bear tag. The problem for RFK Jr. was that he ran out of time to take the bear back to his home in Westchester before having to catch a flight.\n\nSo he and some of his intoxicated friends thought it would be a good idea to make it look like the bear cub got hit by a bike since there had been several local bike accidents at the park.\n\nThe dead bear cub sparked a media frenzy after it was discovered, including a reporter from the New York Times who happened to be Kennedy's niece, Tatiana Schlossberg.\n\nAccording to Schlossberg's report, law enforcement took the bear for analysis and determined that it had been hit by a car. A wildlife expert also weighed in, saying someone might have killed the bear and taken it to Central Park.\n\nAnd now, it looks like our time is just about up for today, so we're going to call it a wrap for the Tuesday edition of The Epoch Times News Brief.\n\nWhatever you have planned for today, when you're out and about, it would mean so much to us if you could tell some people you know about our program. Thank you in advance for helping us grow the News Brief family, and as you know by now, we are trying to become the biggest brief on the block.\n\nWe heard from Robert, who says he's retired, living the good life, and enjoying the News Brief. Debi Worth dropped us a very lovely note, as did Stellar Jay, Morrow, and Shillon.\n\n*(Don't forget the News Brief Motto): We're portable, affordable, and always on-demand.\n\nAnd finally, as we do each and every day on this program, we wrap everything up with a very notable quote, and this one comes to us from Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, who said: \"Bach is an astronomer, discovering the most marvelous stars. Beethoven challenges the universe. I only try to express the soul and the heart of man.\"\n\nInteresting fact: Barry Manilow's hit song from 1975, \"Could It Be Magic,\" was inspired by Chopin's Prelude in C minor, Opus 28, No. 20.\n\nBefore we go, you should know that today is National Root Beer Float Day! If you're going to make one, you need to use the best root beer, which is A&W or Hires, and only the very best vanilla ice cream.\n\nFor all of us here at The Epoch Times News Brief, I'm Bill Thomas.\n\nThank you for making us your one-stop source for a concise, accurate, and unbiased daily synopsis of many of the news stories you need to know about.\n\nEnjoy the remainder of your Tuesday, and we'll see you right back here tomorrow for another edition of The Epoch Times News Brief.

Yet, Google might be on the verge of being punished for years of aggressive business practices that a United States federal judge has now deemed illegal.\n\nThe ruling from Judge Amit Mehta, states that Google has an unfair monopoly over search services and advertising, which if you look at the state of the internet, is hard to argue against. The judge has said that the specific law being violated is section 2 of the Sherman Act, which is an antitrust law in the U.S. that passed into law in 1980. In his ruling, Mehta said:\n\n\"After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\"\n\nGoogle currently has a market cap of $2 trillion, and its reach stretches far into various facets of the internet. This decision is one of the biggest antitrust rulings in years, and comes off the back of various governmental agencies across the globe beginning to really look into big tech companies for their practices, especially those deemed monopolistic.\n\nAs per the Justice Department, section 2 of the Sherman Act outlaws any attempt to \"monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations . . . .\"\n\nSince it was passed, the Supreme Court has ruled that not every restraint of trade is prohibited, but only those that are deemed unreasonable. However, there are certain practices, including price fixing, dividing markets, and rigging bids, that are almost always looked into, as they are deemed overly harmful to competition.\n\nWhile most people and companies who fall afoul of the Sherman Act suffer civil penalties, it is technically criminal not to be in accordance with the legislation. However, prosecutable offenses have previously been limited to serious and clear violations that are deemed intentional. The maximum penalties are $100 million for a corporation, $1 million for a single person, and up to 10 years in prison.\n\nHonestly? We don't know yet. Google's monopolistic practices range from their stranglehold over how blogs and websites write content via a murky SEO formula, to its domination of online advertising and ad revenue, to their farming of content to use for AI-generated material, depriving the people who have actually researched and written things valuable eyeballs. And that's not even the tip of the iceberg.\n\nWhat we do know is that Google is likely to fight this decision, and have all the money in the world to pay for lawyers, so even if there are changes, it's likely we won't see them for years to come.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sandeep_sandhu@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Sandeep Sandhu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amit Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sherman Antitrust Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restraint_of_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Restraint of trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_fixing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price fixing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search engine optimization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1205193642.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

But the parade of major federal cases challenging the power of the tech giants is just getting going.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission started investigating Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta, the parent company of Instagram and WhatsApp, for monopolistic behavior. The government has since sued all four companies -- Google twice -- in what it says is an effort to rein in their power and promote more competition. The companies have denied the claims.\n\nHere's what's next with the U.S. government v. Big Tech.\n\nAmazon\n\nIn September, the F.T.C. and 17 states sued Amazon, accusing it of protecting a monopoly by squeezing sellers on its vast marketplace and favoring its own services. The practices also harmed consumers, the F.T.C. argued, and resulted in some cases of \"artificially higher prices\" because Amazon prevented those selling goods on its site from offering the same products on other online sites for less.\n\nA judge in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington set the trial for October 2026.\n\nAmazon has asked the judge to dismiss the case and has argued that it often offers low prices to consumers and doesn't hurt sellers on its marketplace. The lawsuit shows a \"fundamental misunderstanding of retail,\" the company has argued.\n\nThe chair of the F.T.C., Lina Khan, who is famous in certain circles for a 2017 Yale Law Journal antitrust paper on how to rein in Amazon, has vowed to take on tech monopolies.\n\nAmazon has described the lawsuit as \"misguided\" and warned that if the F.T.C. prevailed, it would \"force Amazon to engage in practices that actually harm consumers and the many businesses that sell in our store.\"\n\nApple\n\nThe Department of Justice sued Apple in March, accusing the company of using a monopoly in the smartphone market to block competition, inflate prices for consumers and stifle competition. The department joined 15 states and the District of Columbia in its lawsuit after a nearly two-year investigation.\n\nIn the suit, filed in U.S. District Court of New Jersey, the department said Apple blocked companies from offering applications that competed with Apple products like cloud-based streaming apps, messaging and the digital wallet.\n\nLast week, Apple filed a motion to dismiss the case and said that its business decisions don't violate antitrust laws. It has also argued that those decisions make the iPhone a better experience.\n\n\"This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets,\" Apple previously said in a statement. \"We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it.\"\n\nGoogle\n\nIn addition to the search lawsuit, the Justice Department filed a separate suit against Google in January 2023 over online advertising. That case is scheduled to go to trial in September.\n\nThe department and eight states sued in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, saying Google acquired rivals through anticompetitive mergers and bullied publishers and advertisers into using the company's ad technology.\n\nIn the search case that the judge ruled upon on Monday, he will next order changes to the company's business to fix the illegal behavior.\n\nMeta\n\nThe F.T.C. sued Meta in December 2020, accusing the company of creating a monopoly in social media by buying Instagram and WhatsApp. The mergers deprived consumers of alternative social media platforms, the F.T.C. argued.\n\nThe lawsuit has taken more twists and turns than the other Big Tech antitrust cases. It was filed in U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia before the company changed its name to Meta, from Facebook. In 2021, Judge James Boasberg dismissed the complaint, saying the F.T.C. didn't adequately define the market that it accused Meta of monopolizing. But he allowed the agency to refile its lawsuit, and it moved forward the next year.\n\nThe F.T.C. joined 40 states in accusing Facebook of buying both Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago to illegally squash competition that could have one day challenged the company's dominance. The regulators have called for the deals to be unwound.\n\nMeta has argued that it didn't acquire Instagram and WhatsApp to kill competition and that it has invested heavily in developing innovations for the apps.\n\nTripp Mickle contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cecilia_kang@nytimes.com", "name":

But the parade of major federal cases challenging the power of the tech giants is just getting going.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission started investigating Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta, the parent company of Instagram and WhatsApp, for monopolistic behavior. The government has since sued all four companies -- Google twice -- in what it says is an effort to rein in their power and promote more competition. The companies have denied the claims.\n\nHere's what's next with the U.S. government v. Big Tech.\n\nIn September, the F.T.C. and 17 states sued Amazon, accusing it of protecting a monopoly by squeezing sellers on its vast marketplace and favoring its own services. The practices also harmed consumers, the F.T.C. argued, and resulted in some cases of \"artificially higher prices\" because Amazon prevented those selling goods on its site from offering the same products on other online sites for less.\n\nA judge in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington set the trial for October 2026.\n\nAmazon has asked the judge to dismiss the case and has argued that it often offers low prices to consumers and doesn't hurt sellers on its marketplace. The lawsuit shows a \"fundamental misunderstanding of retail,\" the company has argued.\n\nThe chair of the F.T.C., Lina Khan, who is famous in certain circles for a 2017 Yale Law Journal antitrust paper on how to rein in Amazon, has vowed to take on tech monopolies.\n\nAmazon has described the lawsuit as \"misguided\" and warned that if the F.T.C. prevailed, it would \"force Amazon to engage in practices that actually harm consumers and the many businesses that sell in our store.\"\n\nThe Department of Justice sued Apple in March, accusing the company of using a monopoly in the smartphone market to block competition, inflate prices for consumers and stifle competition. The department joined 15 states and the District of Columbia in its lawsuit after a nearly two-year investigation.\n\nIn the suit, filed in U.S. District Court of New Jersey, the department said Apple blocked companies from offering applications that competed with Apple products like cloud-based streaming apps, messaging and the digital wallet.\n\nLast week, Apple filed a motion to dismiss the case and said that its business decisions don't violate antitrust laws. It has also argued that those decisions make the iPhone a better experience.\n\n\"This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets,\" Apple previously said in a statement. \"We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it.\"\n\nIn addition to the search lawsuit, the Justice Department filed a separate suit against Google in January 2023 over online advertising. That case is scheduled to go to trial in September.\n\nThe department and eight states sued in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, saying Google acquired rivals through anticompetitive mergers and bullied publishers and advertisers into using the company's ad technology.\n\nIn the search case that the judge ruled upon on Monday, he will next order changes to the company's business to fix the illegal behavior.\n\nThe F.T.C. sued Meta in December 2020, accusing the company of creating a monopoly in social media by buying Instagram and WhatsApp. The mergers deprived consumers of alternative social media platforms, the F.T.C. argued.\n\nThe lawsuit has taken more twists and turns than the other Big Tech antitrust cases. It was filed in U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia before the company changed its name to Meta, from Facebook. In 2021, Judge James Boasberg dismissed the complaint, saying the F.T.C. didn't adequately define the market that it accused Meta of monopolizing. But he allowed the agency to refile its lawsuit, and it moved forward the next year.\n\nThe F.T.C. joined 40 states in accusing Facebook of buying both Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago to illegally squash competition that could have one day challenged the company's dominance. The regulators have called for the deals to be unwound.\n\nMeta has argued that it didn't acquire Instagram and WhatsApp to kill competition and that it has invested heavily in developing innovations for the apps.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 5,

Now that freedom only exists in edges, cracks, and outlying areas after much of the internet was monopolized by a handful of Big Tech companies. And no company has done more to change the internet than Google. What was once a useful no-frills search engine that 'ranked' sites by popularity became its own evil empire that defines what appears and what doesn't.\n\n(Full disclosure, at some point, after writing critically about Google, its search engine decided I should disappear. The same thing has happened to many conservatives, sites, and entire realms of ideas.)\n\nAnd as Google expanded its reach to be a browser, Chrome, a dominant OS, Android, a range of hardware, Pixel, and Chromebooks, and ad search alliances, alternatives simply disappeared.\n\nGoogle's dream for search was eliminating the actual sites and turning results into summaries. Now it's closer than ever to its dream with AI summaries. But now a federal judge ruled that its search is a monopoly. The verdict is decades overdue and the penalty will be more likely to inhibit the deals it cut with companies like Apple, but it's an important step forward to rolling back some of Google's unchecked power.\n\nAnd ditto for Big Tech.\n\nThere are still few alternatives to Google Search. Where there was once an array of alternative search engines, today there's Microsoft's Bing (DuckDuckGo is just Bing's results anonymized) and Brave Search. The handful of others are even smaller and more fitful. And there may be no further development in the field because everyone is racing to build their own AI empires that will spit out results through chatbots rather than providing actual links in response to queries. But at least there may be a tool for taking on Google.\n\nAnd that may mean hope for conservatives and conservative ideas.", "source": {"uri": "frontpagemag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FrontPage Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_greenfield@frontpagemag.com", "name": "Daniel Greenfield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromebook", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chromebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google Chrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_Search", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brave Search"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDuckGo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DuckDuckGo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/History", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://www.frontpagemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/google-evil.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792713", "eventUri": "eng-9792713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 105, "relevance": 1}

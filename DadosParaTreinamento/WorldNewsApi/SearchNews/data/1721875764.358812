It was gathered that the incident happened in a private hostel located in Oye Egbo, a community outside the school premises after Olufogbe and another female occupant disagreed with the right of drying line in the hostel. Our correspondent learnt that the victim moved Olufogbe\u2019s clothes to create space on the clothesline before spreading her clothes. However, Olufogbe protested this act, leading to an exchange of words between the two. The situation escalated quickly as Olufogbe was said to have picked a blade to inflict bodily injuries on the victim. Pictures obtained by our correspondent showed that the victim suffered bloody cuts in her throat, head, and chest. The school\u2019s Vice-Chancellor, Prof Sunday Fashina, confirmed the incident to our correspondent on Saturday. He said, \u201cThe incident happened outside the campus in a private hostel. Nobody dares that within the campus because they know the rules and regulations. If anyone tries that, it will catch up with them. The police are already handling it. \u201cThe suspect is in police custody, and once it involves the police, we cannot interfere. When they are done with their investigations, they will write to the Vice-Chancellor to give their report, then we conduct our investigation. So, let\u2019s wait for the outcome of the police investigation.\u201d Efforts to reach the state Police Public Relations Officer, Sunday Abutu, were unsuccessful as calls made to his phone rang out and he was yet to reply to a message sent to his WhatsApp line as of press time.", "summary": "<p>A 300-level student of the Federal University, Oye Ekiti in Ekiti State, Rachael Olufogbe, has been arrested by the police following a physical assault on a fellow student on Saturday.

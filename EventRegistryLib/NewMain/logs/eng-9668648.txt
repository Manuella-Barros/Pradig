Hundreds of strangers came to say goodbye", "body": "AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- Former U.S. Marine Gerry Brooks died alone at a nursing home in Maine, abandoned and all but forgotten. Then the funeral home posted a notice asking if anyone would serve as a pallbearer or simply attend his burial.\n\nWithin minutes, it was turning away volunteers to carry his casket.\n\nA bagpiper came forward to play at the service. A pilot offered to perform a flyover. Military groups across the state pledged a proper sendoff.\n\nHundreds of people who knew nothing about the 86-year-old beyond his name showed up on a sweltering afternoon and gave Brooks a final salute with full military honors Thursday at the Maine Veterans' Memorial Cemetery in Augusta.\n\nPatriot Guard Riders on motorcycles escorted his hearse on the 40-mile route from the funeral home in Belfast, Maine, to the cemetery. Members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars paid tribute with a 21-gun salute. Volunteers held American flags next to the casket while a crane hoisted a huge flag above the cemetery entrance.\n\nSome saluted while filing by. Others sang The Marines' Hymn.\n\n\"It's an honor for us to be able to do this,\" said Jim Roberts, commander of the VFW post in Belfast. \"There's so much negativity in the world. This is something people can feel good about and rally around. It's just absolutely wonderful.\" He said Brooks' son, granddaughter and son-in-law came to the funeral but did not speak during the service.\n\nRoberts said the VFW is called a couple times a year about a deceased veteran with no family or with one that isn't willing to handle the funeral arrangements. But \"we will always be there.\" Like other veterans helping out Thursday, he hadn't known Brooks.\n\nSo many groups volunteered to take part in paying tribute that there wasn't enough space to fit them into the 20-minute burial service, said Katie Riposta, the funeral director who put out the call for help last week.\n\n\"It renews your faith in humanity,\" she said.\n\nMore than 8 million of the U.S. veterans living are 65 or older, almost half the veteran population. They are overwhelmingly men. That's according to a U.S. Census Bureau report last year. As this generation dies, it said, their collective memory of wartime experiences \"will pass into history.\"\n\nMuch about Brooks' life is unknown.\n\nHe was widowed and lived in Augusta. He died on May 18, less than a week after entering a nursing home, Riposta said. A cause of death was not released.\n\nThe funeral home and authorities reached his next of kin, but no one was willing to come forward or take responsibility for his body, she said.\n\n\"It sounds like he was a good person, but I know nothing about his life,\" Riposta said, noting that after Brooks' death, a woman contacted the funeral home to say he had once taken her in when she had no other place to go, with no details.\n\n\"It doesn't matter if he served one day or made the military his career,\" she said. \"He still deserves to be respected and not alone.\"\n\nThe crowd on Thursday wasn't all strangers -- and it turned out Brooks hadn't been one, either.\n\nVictoria Abbott, executive director of the Bread of Life shelter in Augusta, said he had come every day to eat at their soup kitchen, always ready to crack \"dad jokes\" and make the staff smile. He had a favorite table.\n\n\"Your quintessential 80-year-old, dad jokes every day,\" Abbott said. \"He was really great to have around. He was part of the soup kitchen family.\"\n\nBut most people there Thursday met him too late. The memorial book posted online by Direct Cremation of Maine, which helped to arrange the burial, had a few strangers' good wishes.\n\n\"Sir,\" one began, and ended with \"Semper Fi.\"\n\nThe two others, a couple, thanked Brooks for his service. \"We all deserve the love kindness and respect when we are called home. I hope that you lived a full beautiful life of Love, Kindness, Dreams and Hope,\" they wrote.\n\nThey added: \"Thank you to all those who will make this gentleman's service a proper, well deserved good bye.\"\n\nLinda Laweryson, who served in the Marines, said this was the second funeral in little over a year that she has attended for a veteran who died alone. Everyone deserves to die with dignity and be buried with dignity, she said.\n\nLaweryson read a poem during the graveside service written by a combat Marine who reflects on the spot where Marines graduate from boot camp.\n\n\"I walked the old parade ground, but I was not alone,\" the poem reads. \"I walked the old parade ground and knew that I was home.\"\n\nSeewer reported from Toledo,

They are overwhelmingly men. That's according to a U.S. Census Bureau report last year.\n\nLast year, the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) launched an initiative to combat loneliness among veterans, noting that many do not receive regular visitors or phone calls, more likely to phone crisis hotlines or present at emergency departments.\n\n\"Many of our veterans feel a loss of connection soon after discharge or during the latter stages of life when many of their family and friends have moved or passed away,\" said Dr Indira Subramanian, a VA neurologist.\n\nMuch about Brooks' life is unknown.\n\nHe was widowed and had lived in Augusta before he died on 18 May, less than a week after entering a nursing home, Riposta said. A cause of death was not released.\n\nThe funeral home and authorities were able to reach his next of kin, but no one was willing to come forward or take responsibility for his body, she said.\n\n\"It sounds like he was a good person, but I know nothing about his life,\" Riposta said.\n\n\"It doesn't matter if he served one day or made the military his career,\" she said. \"He still deserves to be respected and not alone.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "edward_helmore@theguardian.com", "name": "Edward Helmore", "type":

A Marine - I have it on good authority from friends who served in the Corps that there are no former Marines, only Marines who are no longer on active duty - Gerry was a widower, apparently with no family, and when he passed away at age 86 in a nursing home in Augusta, Maine, nobody showed up to claim his body or make funeral arrangements.\n\nBut it didn't end there. The funeral home posted a notice asking if anyone in the community would be willing to serve as a pallbearer, or even to attend his funeral.

But when it came time to mark his passing, his community - his country - responded.\n\nSee Related: Love Has No Age Limit: 100-Year-Old WWII Vet Marries 96-Year-Old Sweetheart Near Beaches of Normandy\n\nCold War Redux: American and Russian Navies Play Tag in Waters Near Guantanamo Bay, Cuba\n\nThe VFW post in Belfast was one of the groups involved.\n\n\"It's an honor for us to be able to do this,\" said Jim Roberts, commander of the VFW post in Belfast. \"There's so much negativity in the world.

But \"we will always be there.\" Like other veterans helping out Thursday, he hadn't known Brooks.\n\nIt does renew one's faith in humanity, but there's a cautionary element to Gerry Brooks' tale.\n\nThere are thousands of nursing homes around the country. In those homes are thousands of residents. It makes one wonder, how many other veterans like Gerry Brooks are out there, abandoned and alone, living without any family to visit them, to sit with them, to share their last months and days. If there is one more like Gerry Brooks, that's one too many. While it's wonderful how the community turned out to commemorate the veteran, it would have likewise been wonderful if someone had alerted the community before he died and spread the word that this Marine, this hero, was in the home, alone and unloved.\n\nWe don't know the whole story of Gerry Brooks, of course, other than the sparse details in this story: He was 86, widowed, alone, and in poor health. And now we never will know. But it's a lesson. We should value the veterans of our nation, as well as the elderly in general.

Brooks one last time.\n\nGerry R. Brooks Photo courtesy of Neil Buck\n\nBrooks, 86, of Augusta, was a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps. He died on May 18, 2024, about three weeks after he was diagnosed with brain and several other types of cancer.\n\nNo one in his family stepped forward to claim his body. But after a Facebook post circulated with news of the funeral and the situation, hundreds of people showed up Thursday on a sweltering hot afternoon with temperatures in the 90s for Brooks' funeral, including one person who fainted because of the heat.\n\nKatie Riposta, director of Riposta Funeral Home where Brooks' body was kept, said she received inquires from 100 or so people who called to say they would assist with the funeral for the \"unclaimed\" veteran.\n\n\"There has been an outpouring of support from veterans,\" Riposta said.\n\nThursday's funeral was Riposta Funeral Home's second this year for an unclaimed veteran.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe funeral home assisted with another funeral in February and said that over the past five years, it's becoming a more common situation.\n\nUniformed military pallbearers carry a casket holding Gerry R. Brooks' remains before a graveside service Thursday at Maine Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Augusta. Joe Phelan/Kennebec Journal\n\n\"No one claimed him or wanted to and where it's been over a month, it's not respectful to him to keep him here and it's why we decided to move forward with it,\" Riposta said.\n\nIn Maine, as of the 2020 census, there were more than 109,567 veterans from ages 18 to over 85 and 51% of the veterans were over 65. In Brooks' age category of over 85, there were 10,162 veterans in Maine, with the largest age category in the state being in the 70-75 range, with 17,000 veterans.\n\nThe VA estimated in 2023 that nationally there were around 20,298 unidentified veterans waiting to be buried.\n\nTwo United States Marines fold the U.S. flag that had been draped over Gerry R. Brooks' casket Thursday at Maine Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Augusta. Joe Phelan/Kennebec Journal\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs, a veteran is entitled to a proper burial defined by federal law and the VA in some cases will pay for a portion of fees associated with the burial.\n\nRyan Lorrain, the director of communications for the Maine Bureau of Veteran Services, said his staff has not seen an increase in the number of abandoned veterans, but said it does happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In these instances, our cemetery superintendent and other staff attend the service and accept the veteran's burial flag from the honor guard,\" said Lorrain.\n\nLittle is known about Brooks, but several people who knew him from the Bread of Life soup kitchen in Augusta showed up to honor his memory.\n\nNeil Buck volunteered at the soup kitchen and would sit down with Brooks during his meals to chat, when Brooks would share stories about his life.\n\nBuck said from what he remembers, Brooks grew up locally in central Maine, on a farm, and was widowed.\n\n\"I would just sit down and listen to his stories,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVictoria Abbott, the executive director of the Bread of Life soup kitchen, knew Brooks well through the soup kitchen and helped call the ambulance for him three weeks before he died.\n\n\"He was walking toward the soup kitchen and he didn't look well, and he hadn't looked well,\" she said at the funeral. \"We called the ambulance and found out he had brain cancer and other cancers through his body. Everyone from the soup kitchen signed a card for him.\"\n\nAbbott visited him at the Glenridge rehabilitation center in Augusta, where Brooks spent his final few weeks, but did not know much about him as a person other than his sense of humor. She knew him for about three years, the same length of time she has worked at Bread of Life, but did not know anything about his family.\n\n\"We were happy to have him be a part of the community and he was a treat to see every day,\" she said. \"He had a fun sense of humor.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\" Previous\n\nPortland Press Herald top editor

Brooks one last time.\n\nGerry R. Brooks Photo courtesy of Neil Buck\n\nBrooks, 86, of Augusta, was a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps. He died on May 18, 2024, about three weeks after he was diagnosed with brain and several other types of cancer.\n\nNo one in his family stepped forward to claim his body. But after a Facebook post circulated with news of the funeral and the situation, hundreds of people showed up Thursday on a sweltering hot afternoon with temperatures in the 90s for Brooks' funeral, including one person who fainted because of the heat.\n\nKatie Riposta, director of Riposta Funeral Home where Brooks' body was kept, said she received inquires from 100 or so people who called to say would assist with the funeral for the \"unclaimed\" veteran.\n\n\"There has been an outpouring of support from veterans,\" Riposta said.\n\nThursday's funeral was Riposta Funeral Home's second this year for an unclaimed veteran.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe funeral home assisted with another funeral in February and said that over the past five years, it's becoming a more common situation.\n\nUniformed military pallbearers carry a casket holding Gerry R. Brooks' remains before a graveside service Thursday at Maine Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Augusta. Joe Phelan/Kennebec Journal\n\n\"No one claimed him or wanted to and where it's been over a month, it's not respectful to him to keep him here and it's why we decided to move forward with it,\" Riposta said.\n\nIn Maine, as of the 2020 census, there were more than 109,567 veterans from ages 18 to over 85 and 51% of the veterans were over 65. In Brooks' age category of over 85, there were 10,162 veterans in Maine, with the largest age category in the state being in the 70-75 range, with 17,000 veterans.\n\nThe VA estimated in 2023 that nationally there are around 20,298 unidentified veterans waiting to be buried.\n\nTwo United States Marines fold the U.S. flag that had been draped over Gerry R. Brooks' casket Thursday at Maine Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Augusta. Joe Phelan/Kennebec Journal\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs, a veteran is entitled to a proper burial defined by federal law and the VA in some cases will pay for a portion of fees associated with the burial.\n\nRyan Lorrain, the director of communications for the Maine Bureau of Veteran Services, said his staff has not seen an increase in the number of abandoned veterans, but said it does happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In these instances, our cemetery superintendent and other staff attend the service and accept the veteran's burial flag from the honor guard,\" said Lorrain.\n\nLittle is known about who Brooks was, but several people who knew him from the Bread of Life soup kitchen in Augusta and showed up to honor his memory.\n\nNeil Buck volunteered at the soup kitchen and would sit down with Brooks during his meals to chat, and Brooks would share stories about his life.\n\nBuck said from what he remembers, Brooks grew up locally in central Maine on a farm and is widowed.\n\n\"I would just sit down and listen to his stories,\" he said.\n\nAn honor guard fires a three-round volley during graveside military honors for Gerry R. Brooks Thursday at Maine Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Augusta. Joe Phelan/Kennebec Journal\n\nVictoria Abbott, the executive director of the Bread of Life soup kitchen in Augusta, knew Brooks well through the soup kitchen and helped call the ambulance for him three weeks before he died.\n\n\"He was walking toward the soup kitchen and he didn't look well, and he hadn't looked well,\" she said at the funeral. \"We called the ambulance and found out he had brain cancer and other cancers through his body. Everyone from the soup kitchen signed a card for him.\"\n\nAbbott visited him at the Glenridge rehabilitation center in Augusta, where Brooks spent his final few weeks, but did not know much about him as a person other than his sense of humor. She knew him for about three years, the same length of time she has worked at Bread of Life, but did not know anything about his family.\n\n\"We were happy to have him be a part of the community and he was a treat to see every day,\" she said. \"He had a fun sense of humor.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\" Previous\n\nWaterville City Hall exterior to get

The funeral home posted a public notice June 12 in a local newspaper requesting pallbearers for Brooks' burial. The six positions were filled in a matter of 20 minutes, funeral director Tamara Sinagra said. More than a hundred others had to be turned away.\n\n\"The phone rang nonstop on Friday. We've probably had 200 phone calls, if not more, from people who have volunteered to be pallbearers,\" Sinagra said. \"We have a lot of military organizations who plan to gather their members and show up for the actual service. We've had people to be the clergy, pay for a flower piece to be on his casket, to play the bugle, play the bagpipes. We've had everybody offering to show their support.\"\n\nAn even larger group is expected to attend the burial, which is open to the public and scheduled for noon Thursday at the Maine Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Augusta.\n\nThe RSVP list includes members of Patriot Guard Riders, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion and Disabled Veterans of America. The Belfast chapter of the VFW post will be providing its honor guard and color guard and leading the service.\n\nBrooks died at MaineGeneral Rehabilitation and Long Term Care at Glenridge.\n\nHis son, who was his next of kin, was notified of his death by the funeral home and the local police, said Sinagra. But Neither Direct Cremation nor the police received any sort of response for weeks, she said.\n\n\"Once we had tried for an extended period of time with legal notification methods, we knew that we were hitting a dead end where we still needed to care for Gerry's body in a respectful time frame,\" said Direct Cremation of Maine director Katherine Riposta. \"When it's been almost a month that he's been here with us, we really feel that it's best to move forward with this burial.\"\n\nA body is considered abandoned after being left unclaimed by any family members after an attempt at contact is made to the next of kin. According to Jim Roberts of the Belfast VFW chapter, the number of such cases is on the rise. This was the second occurrence of veteran abandonment Direct Cremation has faced in the past eight months, Riposta said.\n\nAfter the notice was posted, a woman who identified herself as Brooks' granddaughter called the funeral home and said she had not been made aware of her grandfather's death and that she would be attending the service with her father, Sinagra said. The woman did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe surge of widespread support for Brooks shows the reach and strength of connections among veterans.\n\n\"There is a kinship. There is a brotherhood. We all signed the same contract at one point in our lives, pledging up to our lives. So we all have that brotherhood, that kinship,\" Roberts said. \"We do not ask for donations. We don't ask to be paid. We just do this because it's our honor to be able to respect those who served the country.\"\n\nThe ceremony will consist of the Belfast VFW, who will lead the service, presenting the flag to the closest family member if they choose to receive it, a 21 guns salute, a performance of taps, and a few words spoken by the VFW post chapter.\n\n\"When I placed the service notice in the paper, I was hopeful that someone would step forward and stand in for him where his family has opted not to,\" Riposta said. \"The outpouring of support from both laypeople and veterans has been overwhelming and really heartening to everyone.\"", "source": {"uri": "bangordailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangor Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sasha_ray@bangordailynews.com", "name": "Sasha Ray", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cremation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cremation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinagra,_Sicily", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sinagra, Sicily"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sinagra, Sicily"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallbearer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pallbearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral_home", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Funeral home"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_of_Foreign_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Veterans of Foreign Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Augusta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Augusta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bugle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coffin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagpipes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bagpipes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Funeral director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_of_kin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Next of kin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_(American_Revolution)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patriot (American Revolution)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colour guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_of_honour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guard of honour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Legion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Legion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kinship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Death_Care", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Death Care", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death_and_Funeral_Customs", "label": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death and Funeral Customs", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/bdn-data.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/06/Rainbow-Flags-B-LCO.jpg?fit=1200%2C719&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668648", "eventUri": "eng-9668648", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-18", "textStart": 233, "textEnd": 239}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 314, "textEnd": 321}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

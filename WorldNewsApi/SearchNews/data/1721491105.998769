{"id": 237095914, "title": "Is it a good time to sell Nifty 50, Mid Select Index? Check details here", "text": "Nifty Index AnalysisThe Nifty Index is currently trading at 23,465.60. On near-term charts, the index is positioned in the oversold zone, suggesting that selling pressure will likely emerge on any rise. Stiff resistance is anticipated between 23,575 and 23,600. A close above this resistance range could push the index towards 23,800. Conversely, the index is expected to find support at 23,100.Given this setup, the best trading strategy would be to sell either at the current market price (CMP) or on any rise. The target price for this strategy should be 23,100. If the index breaks below 23,100, the next support level would be 22,900.In summary, traders should consider shorting the index at CMP or on any upward movement, aiming for the 23,100 support level as their primary target. If the index continues to decline, the next target should be 22,900. This approach is supported by the oversold conditions on the charts, indicating potential for continued downward momentum in the near term.Nifty Mid Select Index AnalysisThe Nifty Mid Select Index is currently trading at 12,053.20.

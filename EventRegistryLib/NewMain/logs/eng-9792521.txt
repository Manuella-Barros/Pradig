This rainfall will likely result in areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, with river flooding possible.\"\n\n\"On the forecast track,\" forecasters continued, \"the center of Debby is expected to move offshore the coast of Georgia later today, drift offshore through early Thursday, and then move inland over South Carolina on Thursday.\"\n\nTropical storm-force winds extended outward up to 205 miles east of the center, the center added.\n\nParkinson said at 6 a.m EDT that, \"Much of the low country of South Carolina has already received around a foot of rain. Some bands over the state now are bringing rain at a rate of 2-3 inches per hour. In Savannah, they're beginning to get on the back side of the storm, so the worst rain is over, but another 3 inches or so is possible. In Charleston, however, they're in the thick of it right now, and will see torrential rain off and on for at least the next 36 hours. That area is the best candidate for a total above 2 feet by the conclusion of the storm. There is still another 12-16 inches coming to many areas from Debby.\"\n\nDebby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It weakened to a tropical storm and was moving slowly, bringing drenching rain and severe flooding to many areas.\n\nFlash flood warnings were issued in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Both Savannah and Charleston announced curfews Monday night into Tuesday.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday.\n\nRoughly 154,000 customers had no power early Tuesday in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were also canceled nationwide on Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.\n\nIn addition to the curfew, the city of Charleston's emergency plan includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding.\n\nSouth Carolina Emergency Management Division Director Kim Stenson warned that, \"The heavy rains and flooding currently predicted this week are historic in scope and scale. Our experts with the National Hurricane Center believe flooding to be catastrophic for many parts of South Carolina. Take no chances with this storm.\"\n\nOvernight, a suspected tornado hit Monck's Corner, South Carolina. Mayor Thomas Hamilton said there were no major injuries reported but some buildings and vehicles were damaged.\n\nHe offered photos of some of the damage:\n\nIn Edisto Beach, South Carolina, a tornado touched down Monday night, damaging trees, homes and taking down power lines, the Colleton County Sheriff's Office said on social media. No injuries were immediately reported, officials said.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said in a social media post. Just north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said on social media.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that the state could continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" he said. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nFive people had died due to the storm as of Monday night, including a truck driver on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office. In Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night.\n\nIn southern Georgia, a 19-year-old man died Monday afternoon when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie.\n\nPresident Biden approved a request from South Carolina's governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he's asked Mr. Biden to issue a preemptive federal emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to his state.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris postponed a campaign stop scheduled for Thursday in Savannah.\n\nNorth Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order he signed Monday. Several areas along the state's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

The potential for high water threatened Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina. Up to 18 inches (46 centimeters) was forecast in central and north Florida.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because the storm is moving into Georgia, it doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" he said during an afternoon briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nDebby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It has since weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, covering roads with water and contributing to at least four deaths.\n\nA truck driver died on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nAnd in Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night. The Florida Highway Patrol said a 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries.\n\nMore than 300,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nDeSantis said some 17,000 linemen were working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to stay off the roads until conditions are safe.\n\nAirports were also affected. More than 1,600 flights had been canceled nationwide, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday. Nearly 30% of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport were canceled.\n\nSarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, was one of the hardest hit by flooding.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" said Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun in a social media update.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said. Biden has approved a request from South Carolina's governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has postponed a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby. Harris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nLocal leaders in Savannah said flooding could happen in areas that don't usually get high water if Debby stalls out over the city. With winds and rainfall expected to worsen overnight, authorities issued a curfew from 10 p.m. Monday until 6 a.m. Tuesday.\n\n\"This type of rain hovering over us, coming with the intensity that they tell us it is coming, it's going to catch a whole lot of people by surprise,\" said Chatham County Chairman Chester Ellis.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.\n\nThe city of Charleston has an emergency plan in place that includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding.\n\nIn 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.\n\nDebby made landfall near Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida of less than 1,000 residents. It's not far from where Hurricane Idalia made landfall less than a year ago as a Category 3 storm.\n\nSue Chewning lives in Steinhatchee and weathered both storms. In her nearly 73 years of living in the area, she said she doesn't recall any direct hits from a hurricane -- until this one-two punch from Idalia and Debby.\n\n\"Some people may say, 'I can't take this anymore'. But I think for the most part ... it's a close-knit community and most of the local people, they're going to stay, dig down, help each other,\" Chewning said.", "source": {"uri":

The potential for high water threatened Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina. Up to 18 inches was forecast in central and north Florida.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because the storm is moving into Georgia, it doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" he said during an afternoon briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nDebby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It has since weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, covering roads with water and contributing to at least four deaths.\n\nA truck driver died on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor-trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nAnd in Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night. The Florida Highway Patrol said a 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries.\n\nMore than 300,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nDeSantis said some 17,000 linemen were working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to stay off the roads until conditions are safe.\n\nAirports were also affected. More than 1,600 flights had been canceled nationwide, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.\n\nSarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, was one of the hardest hit by flooding.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" said Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun in a social media update.\n\nLocal leaders in Savannah, Georgia, said flooding could happen in areas that don't usually get high water if Debby stalls out over the city. With winds and rainfall expected to worsen overnight, authorities issued a curfew from 10 p.m. Monday until 6 a.m. Tuesday.\n\n\"This type of rain hovering over us, coming with the intensity that they tell us it is coming, it's going to catch a whole lot of people by surprise,\" said Chatham County Chairman Chester Ellis.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.\n\nThe city of Charleston has an emergency plan in place that includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding. Officials announced a curfew for the city starting at 11 p.m. as some of the heaviest rain is expected to fall overnight.\n\nNorth Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed Monday. Several areas along the state's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said. Biden has approved a request from South Carolina's governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he has asked Biden to issue a preemptive federal emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to the state.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has postponed a scheduled trip to Georgia. Harris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nDebby made landfall near Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida of less than 1,000 residents. It's not far from where Hurricane Idalia made landfall less than a year ago as a Category 3 storm.\n\nSue Chewning lives in Steinhatchee and weathered both storms. In her nearly 73 years of living in the area, she said she doesn't recall any direct hits from a hurricane -- until this one-two punch from Idalia and Debby.\n\n\"Some people may say, 'I can't take this anymore'. But I think for the most part ... it's a close-knit community and most of the local people, they're going to stay, dig down, help each other,\" Chewning said.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com",

Up to 18 inches (46 centimeters) was forecast in central and north Florida. A flash flood emergency was issued into Monday evening for the Lake City area, where up to a foot (30.5 centimeters) of rain had fallen and more was expected.\n\nThe potential for high water also threatened Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because the storm was moving into Georgia, it didn't mean the state wouldn't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" he said during an afternoon briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nDebby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It since has weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, covering roads with water and contributing to at least five deaths.\n\nA truck driver died on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nAnd in Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night. The Florida Highway Patrol said a 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries.\n\nIn southern Georgia, a 19-year-old man died Monday afternoon when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n\nNearly 200,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nDeSantis said some 17,000 workers were restoring electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to stay off the roads until conditions are safe.\n\nAirports were also affected. More than 1,600 flights had been canceled nationwide, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.\n\nSarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, was one of the hardest hit by flooding.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" said Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun in a social media update.\n\nLocal leaders in Savannah, Georgia, said flooding could happen in areas that don't usually get high water if Debby stalls out over the city. With winds and rainfall expected to worsen overnight, authorities issued a curfew from 10 p.m. Monday until 6 a.m. Tuesday.\n\n\"This type of rain hovering over us, coming with the intensity that they tell us it is coming, it's going to catch a whole lot of people by surprise,\" said Chatham County Chairman Chester Ellis.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.\n\nThe city of Charleston has an emergency plan in place that includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding. Officials announced a curfew for the city starting at 11 p.m. as some of the heaviest rain is expected to fall overnight.\n\nNorth Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed Monday. Several areas along the state's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said. Biden approved a request from South Carolina's governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he has asked Biden to issue a preemptive federal emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to the state.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has postponed a scheduled trip to Georgia. Harris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nDebby made landfall near Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida of less than 1,000 residents. It's not far from where Hurricane Idalia made landfall less than a year ago as a Category 3 storm.\n\nSue Chewning lives in Steinhatchee and weathered both storms. In her nearly 73 years of living in the area, she said she doesn't recall any direct hits from a hurricane -- until this one-two punch from Idalia and Debby.\n\n\"Some people may say, 'I can't take this anymore'. But I think for the most part ... it's a close-knit community and most of the local people, they're going to stay, dig down, help each other,\" Chewning said.", "source": {"uri":

This rainfall will likely result in areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, with river flooding possible.\"\n\n\"On the forecast track,\" forecasters continued, \"the center of Debby is expected to move offshore the coast of Georgia later today, drift offshore through early Thursday, and then move inland over South Carolina on Thursday.\"\n\nTropical storm-force winds extended outward up to 205 miles east of the center, the center added.\n\nDebby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It weakened to a tropical storm and was moving slowly, bringing drenching rain and severe flooding to many areas.\n\nFlash flood warnings were issued in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Both Savannah and Charleston announced curfews Monday night into Tuesday.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday.\n\nRoughly 154,000 customers had no power early Tuesday in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were also canceled nationwide on Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.\n\nIn addition to the curfew, the city of Charleston's emergency plan includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding.\n\nSouth Carolina Emergency Management Division Director Kim Stenson warned that, \"The heavy rains and flooding currently predicted this week are historic in scope and scale. Our experts with the National Hurricane Center believe flooding to be catastrophic for many parts of South Carolina. Take no chances with this storm.\"\n\nOvernight, a suspected tornado hit Monck's Corner, South Carolina. Mayor Thomas Hamilton said there were no major injuries reported but some buildings and vehicles were damaged.\n\nHe offered photos of some of the damage:\n\nIn Edisto Beach, South Carolina, a tornado touched down Monday night, damaging trees, homes and taking down power lines, the Colleton County Sheriff's Office said on social media. No injuries were immediately reported, officials said.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said in a social media post. Just north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said on social media.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that the state could continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" he said. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nFive people had died due to the storm as of Monday night, including a truck driver on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office. In Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night.\n\nIn southern Georgia, a 19-year-old man died Monday afternoon when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie.\n\nPresident Biden approved a request from South Carolina's governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he's asked Mr. Biden to issue a preemptive federal emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to his state.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris postponed a campaign stop scheduled for Thursday in Savannah.\n\nNorth Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order he signed Monday. Several areas along the state's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain and high winds, contributing to at least four deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities.\n\nRecord-setting rain was expected to cause flash flooding, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) possible in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said. The potential for high water threatened Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina. Up to 18 inches (46 centimeters) was forecast in central and north Florida.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because the storm is moving into Georgia, it doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" he said during an afternoon briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nDebby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It has since weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, covering roads with water and contributing to at least four deaths.\n\nA truck driver died on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nAnd in Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night. The Florida Highway Patrol said a 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries.\n\nMore than 300,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nDeSantis said some 17,000 linemen were working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to stay off the roads until conditions are safe.\n\nAirports were also affected. More than 1,600 flights had been canceled nationwide, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.\n\nSarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, was one of the hardest hit by flooding.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" said Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun in a social media update.\n\nLocal leaders in Savannah, Georgia, said flooding could happen in areas that don't usually get high water if Debby stalls out over the city. With winds and rainfall expected to worsen overnight, authorities issued a curfew from 10 p.m. Monday until 6 a.m. Tuesday.\n\n\"This type of rain hovering over us, coming with the intensity that they tell us it is coming, it's going to catch a whole lot of people by surprise,\" said Chatham County Chairman Chester Ellis.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.\n\nThe city of Charleston has an emergency plan in place that includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding. Officials announced a curfew for the city starting at 11 p.m. as some of the heaviest rain is expected to fall overnight.\n\nNorth Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed Monday. Several areas along the state's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said. Biden has approved a request from South Carolina's governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he has asked Biden to issue a preemptive federal emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to the state.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has postponed a scheduled trip to Georgia. Harris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nDebby made landfall near Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida of less than 1,000 residents. It's not far from where Hurricane Idalia made landfall less than a year ago as a Category 3 storm.\n\nSue Chewning lives in Steinhatchee and weathered both storms. In her nearly 73 years of living in the area, she said she doesn't recall any direct hits from a hurricane -- until this one-two punch from Idalia and Debby.\n\n\"Some people may say, 'I can't take this anymore'. But I think for the most part ... it's a close-knit community and most of the local people, they're going to stay, dig down, help each other,\" Chewning said.", "source": {"uri":

The potential for high water threatened the historic cities of Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina. Up to 18 inches (46 centimeters) was forecast in central and north Florida.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because the storm is moving into Georgia, it doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" he said during an afternoon briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nDebby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It has since weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, covering roads with water and contributing to at least four deaths.\n\nA truck driver died on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nAnd in Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night. The Florida Highway Patrol said a 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries.\n\nMore than 300,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nDeSantis said some 17,000 linemen were working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to stay off the roads until conditions are safe.\n\nAirports were also affected. More than 1,600 flights had been canceled nationwide, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday. Nearly 30% of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport were canceled.\n\nSarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, was one of the hardest hit by flooding.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" said Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun in a social media update.\n\nThe storm made landfall near Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nTaylor County, where Steinhatchee is located, closed several roads due to flooding, Sheriff Wayne Padgett said. Trees and power lines had also fallen across some roads. Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying or coastal areas to wait before returning to their homes because the tide had not come in, and it was unclear how deep floodwaters might get later.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has postponed a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby. Harris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nLocal leaders in Savannah said flooding could happen in areas that don't usually get high water if Debby stalls out over the city.\n\n\"This type of rain hovering over us, coming with the intensity that they tell us it is coming, it's going to catch a whole lot of people by surprise,\" said Chatham County Chairman Chester Ellis.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.\n\nThe city of Charleston has an emergency plan in place that includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding.\n\nIn 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.\n\nIn Savannah, Jim Froncak piled sandbags into his pickup truck on Monday, as rain was already falling. He said a recent thunderstorm caused so much flooding that he and a friend were able to kayak down a street.\n\n\"That was just a thunderstorm,\" he said. \"So, who knows what could happen with

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby moved menacingly into some of America's most historic Southern cities and was expected to bring prolonged downpours and flooding throughout the day Tuesday after slamming into Florida and prompting the rescue of hundreds from flooded homes.\n\nRecord-setting rain from the storm that killed at least five people on Monday was causing flash flooding, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) possible in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nThe storm's center was over southeastern Georgia early Tuesday with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (75 kph) and it was moving northeast near 7 mph (11 kph). The center is expected to move off Georgia's coast later Tuesday. Some strengthening is forecast on Wednesday and Thursday as Debby drifts offshore, before it moves inland over South Carolina on Thursday.\n\n\"Hunker down,\" Van Johnson, the mayor of Savannah, Georgia, told residents in a social media livestream Monday night. \"Expect that it will be a rough day\" on Tuesday, he said.\n\nFlash flood warnings were issued in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Both Savannah and Charleston announced curfews Monday night into Tuesday.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday.\n\nIn addition to the curfew, the city of Charleston's emergency plan includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding.\n\nIn Edisto Beach, South Carolina, a tornado touched down Monday night, damaging trees, homes and taking down power lines, the Colleton County Sheriff's Office said on social media. No injuries were immediately reported, officials said.\n\nThe National Weather Service continued issuing tornado warnings well into Monday night for parts of the state including in the island town of Hilton Head.\n\nDebby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It has weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, drenching and bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across portions of eastern Georgia, the coastal plain of South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Wednesday.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said in a social media post. Just north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said on social media.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that the state could continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" he said. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nFive people had died due to the storm as of Monday night, including a truck driver on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office. In Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night.\n\nIn southern Georgia, a 19-year-old man died Monday afternoon when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n\nMore than 140,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp. Nearly 12,000 more were without power in South Carolina early Tuesday.\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were also canceled nationwide on Monday and more than 550 flights were canceled early Tuesday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved a request from South Carolina's governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he has asked Biden to issue a preemptive federal emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to the state.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris postponed a campaign stop scheduled for Thursday in Savannah.\n\nNorth Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed Monday. Several areas along the state's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type":

A 13-year-old boy was killed when a tree fell on his mobile home in Levy Country, Florida on Monday. A 12-year-old girl is also said to have been killed by a falling tree in the same county.\n\nA woman and 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night in Dixie County - near where the storm first made landfall. In another horrific road traffic accident, a truck driver died after his cab flipped into a river below the highway. In southern Georgia, a 19-year-old man died when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, local media reported - the first death caused by Debby in the state.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on the Big Bend coast of Florida early Monday, where it damaged homes and businesses, sent floodwaters rising, and caused sweeping power outages . It was downgraded to a tropical storm at midday yesterday, and is moving slowly up the coast, but experts say the worst is yet to come as the storm system is expected to stall over the region, resulting in 'historic' downpours and 'catastrophic flooding'.\n\nThe mayor of Savannah, Georgia, has warned residents to 'hunker down', adding that people should expect Tuesday 'to be a rough day' as weather maps show the storm sweeping up the coast from Florida, into Georgia and towards the Carolinas. Northern Florida, the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina and parts of North Carolina are facing downpours, high winds and catastrophic flooding this week as the storm system moves up and east. The National Hurricane Centre has said that its slow movement could result in 'potentially historic heavy rainfall across southeast Georgia and eastern South Carolina through Friday' which will 'likely result in catastrophic flooding'.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has approved a request from South Carolina's governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. He has also now approved an emergency declaration for Georgia following a request by Governor Brian Kemp, who hoped it would speed up the flow of federal aid to the state. North Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Governor Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed on Monday. There are fears that potentially deadly conditions could persist as the storm continues on its path.\n\nThe truck driver who died on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area yesterday, lost control of his tractor-trailer before it flipped over a concrete wall. It dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver in the cab 40 feet (12 metres) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol, and he was declared dead. The 13-year-old boy who lost his life died at around 8am on Monday after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office. Pictures show his home crushed under the huge tree. No other injuries were reported.\n\nForecasters say the system could pummel the Southeast with widespread areas of up to 20 inches (51cm) of rain and some totaling up to 30 inches (76cm). That would be a record-setting rainfall, shattering the record from a tropical system in 2018's Hurricane Florence. More than 23 inches (58 centimeters) of rain was recorded in South Carolina after that storm hit the Carolinas. Although Debby was classified as a Category 1, 'It really is worthy of a Category 3 or 4 rating, if you want to talk about rainfall impacts,' said Jeff Masters, founder of Weather Underground, now with Yale Climate Connections. 'That's going to cause a lot of damage.' After the storm hit, Florida's Governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 61 counties across the state. The storm has caused heavy flooding in communities across Florida and Georgia.\n\nOne Fort Myers resident said they were 'shocked' and worried as the flooding continued to rise. They said: 'Everyone was sat inside their homes watching the water rise so we went out to check on a few of our neighbours. 'I was so shocked by the flooding - we were worried for all the residents. Luckily our property is safe.' The storm has already left destruction and 'deadly hazards' in its wake, including downed power lines, flooding which has swept away cars and wrecked homes. According to reports, 150,000 homes and businesses were without power on Monday night, in Florida. Flash flood warnings were issued in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Both Savannah and Charleston announced curfews Monday night into Tuesday.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a 'historic and potentially unprecedented event' three times in a 90-second briefing Monday. In addition to the curfew, the city of Charleston's emergency plan includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding. A tornado touched down in the state on Monday night, damaging trees, and homes and taking down power lines, the Colleton County Sheriff's Office said on social media. No injuries were immediately reported, officials said. The National Weather Service continued issuing tornado warnings well into Monday night for parts of the state including in the island town of Hilton Head. Shortly after Debby made landfall as a hurricane, about 500 people were rescued on Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said in a social media post.\n\nJust north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters. 'Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,' Sarasota County fire chief David Rathbun said on social media. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis warned that the state could continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south. The governor also activated his state's national guard, with more than 3,000 service members mobilised to help with the storm response.\n\nHe warned that the state could continue to be wary of threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south. 'It is a very saturating, wet storm,' he said. 'When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.' Nearly 160,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday night, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to operators.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

(AP Photo/Stephen B. Morton)\n\nTropical Storm Debby moved menacingly into some of America's most historic Southern cities and was expected to bring prolonged downpours and flooding throughout the day Tuesday after slamming into Florida and prompting the rescue of hundreds from flooded homes.\n\nRecord-setting rain from the storm that killed at least five people was causing flash flooding, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) possible in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nThe storm's center was over southeast Georgia early Tuesday with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (75 kph) and it was moving northeast near 7 mph (11 kph). The center is expected to move off Georgia's coast later Tuesday. Some strengthening is forecast Wednesday and Thursday as Debby drifts offshore, before it moves inland Thursday over South Carolina.\n\n\"Hunker down,\" Van Johnson, the mayor of Savannah, Georgia, told residents in a social media livestream Monday night. \"Expect that it will be a rough day\" on Tuesday, he said.\n\nMore than 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain had fallen through Monday at Savannah's airport, but more rain fell overnight and was continuing Tuesday, the National Weather Service reported.\n\nFlash flood warnings were issued in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Both Savannah and Charleston announced curfews Monday night into Tuesday.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday.\n\nIn addition to the curfew, the city of Charleston's emergency plan includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding.\n\nIn Edisto Beach, South Carolina, a tornado touched down Monday night, damaging trees, homes and taking down power lines, the Colleton County Sheriff's Office said on social media. No injuries were immediately reported, officials said.\n\nThe weather service continued issuing tornado warnings well into Monday night for parts of the state including Hilton Head Island.\n\nAt the edge of Hilton Head Island, musician Nick Poulin wasn't overly concerned about Debby since his equipment was inside and he made sure that his car wasn't parked under trees so it won't be hit by falling branches.\n\n\"I'm born and raised here, so we've had plenty of storms,\" he said. \"It's usually not as bad as people hype it up to be.\"\n\nDebby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It has weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, drenching and bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across portions of eastern Georgia, the coastal plain of South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Wednesday.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said in a social media post. Just north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said on social media.\n\nFlorida Gov.

Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office. In Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night.\n\nIn south Georgia, a 19-year-old man died Monday afternoon when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n\nMore than 140,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp. Nearly 12,000 more were without power in South Carolina early Tuesday.\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were also canceled nationwide on Monday and more than 550 flights were canceled early Tuesday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved a request from South Carolina's governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he has asked Biden to issue a preemptive federal emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to the state.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris postponed a campaign stop scheduled for Thursday in Savannah.\n\nNorth Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed Monday. Several areas along the state's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score":

The center is expected to move off Georgia's coast later Tuesday. Some strengthening is forecast Wednesday and Thursday as Debby drifts offshore, before it moves inland Thursday over South Carolina.\n\n\"Hunker down,\" Van Johnson, the mayor of Savannah, Georgia, told residents in a social media livestream Monday night. \"Expect that it will be a rough day\" on Tuesday, he said.\n\nMore than 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain had fallen through Monday at Savannah's airport, but more rain fell overnight and was continuing Tuesday, the National Weather Service reported.\n\nFlash flood warnings were issued in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Both Savannah and Charleston announced curfews Monday night into Tuesday.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday.\n\nIn addition to the curfew, the city of Charleston's emergency plan includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding.\n\nIn Edisto Beach, South Carolina, a tornado touched down Monday night, damaging trees, homes, and taking down power lines, the Colleton County Sheriff's Office said on social media. No injuries were immediately reported, officials said.\n\nThe weather service continued issuing tornado warnings well into Monday night for parts of the state including Hilton Head Island.\n\nAt the edge of Hilton Head Island, musician Nick Poulin wasn't overly concerned about Debby since his equipment was inside and he made sure that his car wasn't parked under trees so it won't be hit by falling branches.\n\n\"I'm born and raised here, so we've had plenty of storms,\" he said. \"It's usually not as bad as people hype it up to be.\"\n\nDebby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It has weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, drenching, and bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across portions of eastern Georgia, the coastal plain of South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Wednesday.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said in a social media post. Just north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said on social media.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that the state could continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" he said. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nFive people had died due to the storm as of Monday night, including a truck driver on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office. In Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night.\n\nIn south Georgia, a 19-year-old man died Monday afternoon when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n\nMore than 140,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp. Nearly 12,000 more were without power in South Carolina early Tuesday.\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were also canceled nationwide on Monday and more than 550 flights were canceled early Tuesday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved a request from South Carolina's governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he has asked Biden to issue a preemptive federal emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to the state.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris postponed a campaign stop scheduled for Thursday in Savannah.\n\nNorth Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov.

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby moved menacingly into some of America's most historic Southern cities and was expected to bring prolonged downpours and flooding throughout the day Tuesday after slamming into Florida and prompting the rescue of hundreds from flooded homes.\n\nRecord-setting rain from the storm that killed at least five people on Monday was causing flash flooding, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) possible in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nThe storm's center was over southeastern Georgia early Tuesday with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (75 kph) and it was moving northeast near 7 mph (11 kph). The center is expected to move off Georgia's coast later Tuesday. Some strengthening is forecast on Wednesday and Thursday as Debby drifts offshore, before it moves inland over South Carolina on Thursday.\n\n\"Hunker down,\" Van Johnson, the mayor of Savannah, Georgia, told residents in a social media livestream Monday night. \"Expect that it will be a rough day\" on Tuesday, he said.\n\nFlash flood warnings were issued in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Both Savannah and Charleston announced curfews Monday night into Tuesday.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday.\n\nIn addition to the curfew, the city of Charleston's emergency plan includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding.\n\nIn Edisto Beach, South Carolina, a tornado touched down Monday night, damaging trees, homes and taking down power lines, the Colleton County Sheriff's Office said on social media. No injuries were immediately reported, officials said.\n\nThe National Weather Service continued issuing tornado warnings well into Monday night for parts of the state including in the island town of Hilton Head.\n\nDebby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It has weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, drenching and bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across portions of eastern Georgia, the coastal plain of South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Wednesday.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said in a social media post. Just north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said on social media.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that the state could continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" he said. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nFive people had died due to the storm as of Monday night, including a truck driver on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office. In Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night.\n\nIn southern Georgia, a 19-year-old man died Monday afternoon when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n\nMore than 140,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp. Nearly 12,000 more were without power in South Carolina early Tuesday.\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were also canceled nationwide on Monday and more than 550 flights were canceled early Tuesday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved a request from South Carolina's governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he has asked Biden to issue a preemptive federal emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to the state.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris postponed a campaign stop scheduled for Thursday in Savannah.\n\nNorth Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed Monday. Several areas along the state's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.\n\nMartin reported from Atlanta.

Several areas along the state's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.\n\n___\n\nMartin reported from Atlanta.

Fire and rescue services pulled it out and the man was declared dead\n\nA drone view shows houses and streets flooded as Hurricane Debby affects the gulf coast in Suwannee, Florida, U.S., August 5, 2024\n\nThe latest death toll from the ferocious storm stands at six - with five reported dead in Florida and one in Georgia.\n\nAmong the dead so far is a 64-year-old truck driver from Mississippi lost his life on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area.\n\nThe driver lost control of his tractor-trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nSheriff's office divers located the driver in the cab 40 feet (12 metres) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died at around 8am on Monday after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nPictures show his home crushed under the huge tree. No other injuries were reported.\n\nA 12-year-old girl was also killed by a falling tree in Levy County, according to officials.\n\nIn Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night.\n\nIn southern Georgia, a 19-year-old man died when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n\nDebby was downgraded to a tropical storm at midday yesterday, and is moving slowly up the coast\n\nThe NOAA's predictions for the movement of storm-force winds up the coast this week\n\nPresident Joe Biden has approved a request from South Carolina's governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida.\n\nHe has also now approved an emergency declaration for Georgia following a request by Governor Brian Kemp, who hoped it would speed up the flow of federal aid to the state.\n\nNorth Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Governor Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed on Monday.\n\nForecasters say the system could pummel the Southeast with widespread areas of up to 20 inches (51cm) of rain and some totaling up to 30 inches (76cm).\n\nThat would be a record-setting rainfall, shattering the record from a tropical system in 2018's Hurricane Florence.\n\nMore than 23 inches (58 centimeters) of rain was recorded in South Carolina after that storm hit the Carolinas.\n\nBuildings sit along the coast line as the rain and storm surge from Hurricane Debby inundate a neighborhood in Cedar Key, Florida\n\nA large sinkhole opened up on Grange Fall Loop in Wimauma after heavy rainfall\n\nTow trucks lift a transfer truck that overturned on Independence Parkway in Tampa on Monday\n\nVehicles drive through a flooded street caused by rain from Tropical Storm Debby on August 5, 2024 in Savannah, Georgia\n\nEthan Widner, left, and Nick Davis watch traffic drive through floodwaters at Webber Street and Brink Avenue, near the bridge over Philippi Creek in Sarasota, Florida\n\nA resident walks through a flooded street caused by the rain and storm surge from Debby\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, 'It really is worthy of a Category 3 or 4 rating, if you want to talk about rainfall impacts,' said Jeff Masters, founder of Weather Underground, now with Yale Climate Connections. 'That's going to cause a lot of damage.'\n\nAfter the storm hit, Florida's Governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 61 counties across the state.\n\nThe storm has caused heavy flooding in communities across Florida and Georgia.\n\nOne Fort Myers resident said they were 'shocked' and worried as the flooding continued to rise.\n\nThey said: 'Everyone was sat inside their homes watching the water rise so we went out to check on a few of our neighbours.\n\n'I was so shocked by the flooding - we were worried for all the residents. Luckily our property is safe.'\n\nThe storm has already left destruction and 'deadly hazards' in its wake, including downed power lines, flooding which has swept away cars and wrecked homes.\n\nAccording to reports, 150,000 homes and businesses were without power on Monday night, in Florida.\n\nA view of Talmadge Memorial Bridge in Savannah, GA, as Tropical Storm Debby moves in\n\nBeachgoers enjoy the sea as Hurricane Debby moves north of central Florida towards Georgia\n\nAngela Ortiz, left, hands her son Barrett Ortiz, right a stack of sandbags while preparing for the storm at a county park in Georgia\n\nHershey Stepherson, left, and Bryan Burc, right, use a five gallon bucket to fill a sandbag while preparing for the storm\n\nFlash flood warnings were issued in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Both Savannah and Charleston announced curfews Monday night into Tuesday.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a 'historic and potentially unprecedented event' three times in a 90-second briefing Monday.\n\nIn addition to the curfew, the city of Charleston's emergency plan includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding.\n\nA tornado touched down in the state on Monday night, damaging trees, and homes and taking down power lines, the Colleton County Sheriff's Office said on social media. No injuries were immediately reported, officials said.\n\nThe National Weather Service continued issuing tornado warnings well into Monday night for parts of the state including in the island town of Hilton Head.\n\nShortly after Debby made landfall as a hurricane, about 500 people were rescued on Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said in a social media post.\n\nBret Kasol, 40, wades out to his boat, which is close to being beached just by the sea wall of Gulfport, Florida\n\nA car passes under traffic signals swaying in the wind due to tropical storm Debby in Waverly, Georgia\n\nJoey Larsen checks on his neighborhood as high winds, rain and storm surge from Hurricane Debby inundated the area on Monday\n\nStorm surge breaks over a small sea wall near boat docks, in Horseshoe Beach, Florida\n\nJust north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n'Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,' Sarasota County fire chief David Rathbun said on social media.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis warned that the state could continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\nThe governor also activated his state's national guard, with more than 3,000 service members mobilised to help with the storm response.\n\nHe warned that the state could continue to be wary of threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n'It is a very saturating, wet storm,' he said. 'When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.'\n\nNearly 160,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday night, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to operators.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

Here's how much rain could fall - WTOP News", "body": "Northern Florida, the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina and parts of North Carolina are bracing for severe rain...\n\nNorthern Florida, the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina and parts of North Carolina are bracing for severe rain and catastrophic flooding this week as the Debby storm system moves up and east.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on the Big Bend coast of Florida early Monday, first hitting the small community of Steinhatchee. It damaged homes and businesses, sent floodwaters rising, caused sweeping power outages across the state and Georgia and led to several fatalities. Debby was downgraded to a tropical storm midday Monday.\n\nBut experts say the worst is yet to come as the storm system is expected to stall over the Southeast region.\n\nForecasters say the system could pummel the Southeast with widespread areas of up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain and some totaling up to 30 inches (76 centimeters).\n\nThat would be a record-setting rainfall, shattering the record from a tropical system in 2018's Hurricane Florence. More than 23 inches (58 centimeters) of rain was recorded in South Carolina after that storm hit the Carolinas.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, \"It really is worthy of a Category 3 or 4 rating, if you want to talk about rainfall impacts,\" said Jeff Masters, founder of Weather Underground, now with Yale Climate Connections. \"That's going to cause a lot of damage.\"\n\nNorthern Florida as well as low-lying areas including Savannah, Georgia, and Hilton Head Island and Charleston, South Carolina, are expected to see the most severe flooding. North Carolina could also be impacted.\n\nOfficials in Savannah warned the area could see a month's worth of rain in four days if the system stalls. There were also flooding concerns for Tybee Island, Georgia's largest public beach 18 miles (28.97 kilometers) east of Savannah. On top of any torrential downpours that Debby dishes out, the island could get even wetter from 2 to 4 feet of storm surge, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Hilton Head Island Mayor Alan Perry said on a video posted to Facebook. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.\n\nFew places in South Carolina are as susceptible to flooding as Charleston. Much of the city and surrounding areas founded in 1670 were built on land created by using fill dirt and other debris. Rising sea levels cause a number of minor flooding events even without a storm and like many coastal cities, Charleston can't drain well.\n\nThe city doesn't expect a massive amount of flooding from the ocean, but the storm is still dangerous. Heavy rain can back up into the city, also causing flooding.\n\nSome hurricanes make landfall and move quickly, experts say, while others slow substantially.\n\n\"Really what happened, and why the storm has stalled, is because there's basically high pressure areas to the west of the storm and to the northeast, and that's kind of pinned the storm,\" said Phil Klotzbach, senior research scientist at Colorado State University's Department of Atmospheric Science. \"With a hurricane you always have wind problems, but when you have a storm moving at 3 to 5 miles an hour, it's going to be over any specific location for a very long period of time, so flash flooding and just tremendous rainfall totals are going to be very likely.\"\n\nExperts say the warming atmosphere plays a role in the severity of storm surges such as Debby.\n\nWarming water in the northeast Gulf of Mexico is increasing Hurricane Debby's heavy rains, as more moisture evaporates from the waters, Masters said. Some research says climate change can impact the forward motion of hurricanes, he added, making them go slower.\n\n\"It's something we've been seeing more of lately,\" Masters said.\n\nThe worst of the rain is expected during the first half of the week, but it could last through Saturday, forecasters said.\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit.

Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said personnel from the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard are deploying to the region and are prepared to support recovery efforts.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday ahead of Debby's anticipated rainfall. Flooding and power outages are expected to start Tuesday and continue through the rest of the week, according to North Carolina Emergency Management officials.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis previously had declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida's 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also had made his own emergency declaration.\n\nCurfew announced for Savannah and surrounding county as Debby approaches\n\nWith Debby's winds and rains expected to worsen overnight, officials for Savannah and surrounding Chatham County announced that an overnight curfew will take effect at 10 p.m. Monday and run to 6 a.m. Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nFlorida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.\n\nNo deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nMayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island: Don't let your guard down\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nIn saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nPackages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nDebby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nBiden briefed on Debby's progress\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 50 mph (85 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was near the Florida-Georgia border and was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to decrease in speed as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nBig worry is storm surge from Debby\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nHundreds of thousands without power\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\n-- -\n\nThis version corrects the attribution for power outage figures to PowerOutage.us, not PowerOutage.com.\n\nMore from this

Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nAnd in Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night. The Florida Highway Patrol said a 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries.\n\nMore than 300,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this.

More than 1,600 flights had been canceled nationwide, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby moved menacingly into some of America's most historic Southern cities and was expected to bring prolonged downpours and flooding throughout the day Tuesday after slamming into Florida and prompting the rescue of hundreds from flooded homes.\n\nRecord-setting rain from the storm that killed at least five people on Monday was causing flash flooding, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) possible in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\n\"Hunker down,\" Van Johnson, the mayor of Savannah, Georgia, told residents in a social media livestream Monday night. \"Expect that it will be a rough day\" on Tuesday, he said.\n\nFlash flood warnings were issued in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Both Savannah and Charleston announced curfews Monday night into Tuesday.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday.\n\nIn addition to the curfew, the city of Charleston's emergency plan includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding.\n\nIn Edisto Beach, South Carolina, a tornado touched down Monday night, damaging trees, homes and taking down power lines, the Colleton County Sheriff's Office said on social media. No injuries were immediately reported, officials said.\n\nThe National Weather Service continued issuing tornado warnings well into Monday night for parts of the state including in the island town of Hilton Head.\n\nDebby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It has weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, drenching and bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across portions of eastern Georgia, the coastal plain of South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Wednesday.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said in a social media post. Just north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said on social media.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that the state could continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" he said. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nFive people had died due to the storm as of Monday night, including a truck driver on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office. In Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night.\n\nIn southern Georgia, a 19-year-old man died Monday afternoon when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n\nNearly 160,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday night, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were also canceled nationwide on Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved a request from South Carolina's governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he has asked Biden to issue a preemptive federal emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to the state.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris postponed a campaign stop scheduled for Thursday in Savannah.\n\nNorth Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed Monday. Several areas along the state's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.\n\n___\n\nMartin reported from Atlanta.

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby moved menacingly into some of America's most historic Southern cities and was expected to bring prolonged downpours and flooding throughout the day Tuesday after slamming into Florida and prompting the rescue of hundreds from flooded homes.\n\nRecord-setting rain from the storm that killed at least five people on Monday was causing flash flooding, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) possible in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\n\"Hunker down,\" Van Johnson, the mayor of Savannah, Georgia, told residents in a social media livestream Monday night. \"Expect that it will be a rough day\" on Tuesday, he said.\n\nFlash flood warnings were issued in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Both Savannah and Charleston announced curfews Monday night into Tuesday.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday.\n\nIn addition to the curfew, the city of Charleston's emergency plan includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding.\n\nIn Edisto Beach, South Carolina, a tornado touched down Monday night, damaging trees, homes and taking down power lines, the Colleton County Sheriff's Office said on social media. No injuries were immediately reported, officials said.\n\nThe National Weather Service continued issuing tornado warnings well into Monday night for parts of the state including in the island town of Hilton Head.\n\nDebby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It has weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, drenching and bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across portions of eastern Georgia, the coastal plain of South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Wednesday.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said in a social media post. Just north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said on social media.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that the state could continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" he said. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nFive people had died due to the storm as of Monday night, including a truck driver on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office. In Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night.\n\nIn southern Georgia, a 19-year-old man died Monday afternoon when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n\nNearly 160,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday night, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were also canceled nationwide on Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved a request from South Carolina's governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he has asked Biden to issue a preemptive federal emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to the state.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris postponed a campaign stop scheduled for Thursday in Savannah.\n\nNorth Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed Monday. Several areas along the state's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

High-water vehicles will also be staged to go into the area as needed, Charleston Mayor William Cogswell said at a Monday evening news conference.\n\n\"We need people to make their way out. This is not something you can stay at the bar until 10:45. We need you to take this seriously,\" Cogswell said.\n\nThe mayor said forecasters told him 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain could fall in Charleston overnight.\n\nCity officials will assess the situation early Tuesday and decide how and when to reopen roads and lift the curfew. No evacuations planned for now in South Carolina, officials say\n\nState officials don't plan any evacuations in South Carolina for now as Tropical Storm Debby slowly spins toward the state.\n\nLarge-scale evacuations typically bring people inland from the coast, and forecasters say Debby's biggest impacts could be as much as 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain in localized areas throughout the state, causing floodwaters to rise quickly in small areas. So any evacuations will up to local leaders.\n\n\"This storm may not have the high winds of a hurricane, but it has the potential to cause life-threatening floods across the state. And I would like to emphasize that Tropical Storm Debby is not just a coastal event, but it is a statewide event,\" state Emergency Management Division Director Kim Stenson said at a Monday afternoon news conference. Biden approves request from South Carolina's governor for emergency declaration\n\nThe White House said Monday that President Joe Biden has approved a request from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said personnel from the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard are deploying to the region and are prepared to support recovery efforts.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday ahead of Debby's anticipated rainfall. Flooding and power outages are expected to start Tuesday and continue through the rest of the week, according to North Carolina Emergency Management officials.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis previously had declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida's 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also had made his own emergency declaration. Curfew announced for Savannah and surrounding county as Debby approaches\n\nWith Debby's winds and rains expected to worsen overnight, officials for Savannah and surrounding Chatham County announced that an overnight curfew will take effect at 10 p.m. Monday and run to 6 a.m. Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said. Florida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east. No deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents. Mayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island: Don't let your guard down\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days. In saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago. Packages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found. Vice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east. Debby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers. Biden briefed on Debby's progress\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said. A 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. Debby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 50 mph (85 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was near the Florida-Georgia border and was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to decrease in speed as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning. Big worry is storm surge from Debby\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week. Hundreds of thousands without power\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\n-- -\n\nThis version corrects the attribution for power outage figures to PowerOutage.us, not PowerOutage.com.", "source": {"uri":

Here's How Much Rain Could Fall", "body": "Northern Florida, the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina and parts of North Carolina are bracing for severe rain and catastrophic flooding this week as the Debby storm system moves up and east.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on the Big Bend coast of Florida early Monday, first hitting the small community of Steinhatchee. It damaged homes and businesses, sent floodwaters rising, caused sweeping power outages across the state and Georgia and led to several fatalities. Debby was downgraded to a tropical storm midday Monday.\n\nBut experts say the worst is yet to come as the storm system is expected to stall over the Southeast region.\n\nHow much rain is expected?\n\nForecasters say the system could pummel the Southeast with widespread areas of up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain and some totaling up to 30 inches (76 centimeters).\n\nThat would be a record-setting rainfall, shattering the record from a tropical system in 2018's Hurricane Florence. More than 23 inches (58 centimeters) of rain was recorded in South Carolina after that storm hit the Carolinas.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, \"It really is worthy of a Category 3 or 4 rating, if you want to talk about rainfall impacts,\" said Jeff Masters, founder of Weather Underground, now with Yale Climate Connections. \"That's going to cause a lot of damage.\"\n\nWhat areas are at risk?\n\nNorthern Florida as well as low-lying areas including Savannah, Georgia, and Hilton Head Island and Charleston, South Carolina, are expected to see the most severe flooding. North Carolina could also be impacted.\n\nOfficials in Savannah warned the area could see a month's worth of rain in four days if the system stalls. There were also flooding concerns for Tybee Island, Georgia's largest public beach 18 miles (28.97 kilometers) east of Savannah. On top of any torrential downpours that Debby dishes out, the island could get even wetter from 2 to 4 feet of storm surge, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Hilton Head Island Mayor Alan Perry said on a video posted to Facebook. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.\n\nFew places in South Carolina are as susceptible to flooding as Charleston. Much of the city and surrounding areas founded in 1670 were built on land created by using fill dirt and other debris. Rising sea levels cause a number of minor flooding events even without a storm and like many coastal cities, Charleston can't drain well.\n\nThe city doesn't expect a massive amount of flooding from the ocean, but the storm is still dangerous. Heavy rain can back up into the city, also causing flooding.\n\nWhat's causing this storm to stall?\n\nSome hurricanes make landfall and move quickly, experts say, while others slow substantially.\n\n\"Really what happened, and why the storm has stalled, is because there's basically high pressure areas to the west of the storm and to the northeast, and that's kind of pinned the storm,\" said Phil Klotzbach, senior research scientist at Colorado State University's Department of Atmospheric Science. \"With a hurricane you always have wind problems, but when you have a storm moving at 3 to 5 miles an hour, it's going to be over any specific location for a very long period of time, so flash flooding and just tremendous rainfall totals are going to be very likely.\"\n\nExperts say the warming atmosphere plays a role in the severity of storm surges such as Debby.\n\nWarming water in the northeast Gulf of Mexico is increasing Hurricane Debby's heavy rains, as more moisture evaporates from the waters, Masters said. Some research says climate change can impact the forward motion of hurricanes, he added, making them go slower.\n\n\"It's something we've been seeing more of lately,\" Masters said.\n\nHow long could this last?\n\nThe worst of the rain is expected during the first half of the week, but it could last through Saturday, forecasters said.\n\n___\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit.

(Douglas R. Clifford/Tampa Bay Times via AP)\n\nBy JEFF MARTIN and CHRISTOPHER O'MEARA Associated Press\n\nHORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby moved menacingly into some of America's most historic Southern cities and was expected to bring prolonged downpours and flooding throughout the day Tuesday after slamming into Florida and prompting the rescue of hundreds from flooded homes.\n\nRecord-setting rain from the storm that killed at least five people on Monday was causing flash flooding, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) possible in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nThe storm's center was over southeastern Georgia early Tuesday with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (75 kph) and it was moving northeast near 7 mph (11 kph). The center is expected to move off Georgia's coast later Tuesday. Some strengthening is forecast on Wednesday and Thursday as Debby drifts offshore, before it moves inland over South Carolina on Thursday.\n\n\"Hunker down,\" Van Johnson, the mayor of Savannah, Georgia, told residents in a social media livestream Monday night. \"Expect that it will be a rough day\" on Tuesday, he said.\n\nFlash flood warnings were issued in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Both Savannah and Charleston announced curfews Monday night into Tuesday.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday.\n\nIn addition to the curfew, the city of Charleston's emergency plan includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding.\n\nIn Edisto Beach, South Carolina, a tornado touched down Monday night, damaging trees, homes and taking down power lines, the Colleton County Sheriff's Office said on social media. No injuries were immediately reported, officials said.\n\nThe National Weather Service continued issuing tornado warnings well into Monday night for parts of the state including in the island town of Hilton Head.\n\nDebby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It has weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, drenching and bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across portions of eastern Georgia, the coastal plain of South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Wednesday.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said in a social media post. Just north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said on social media.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that the state could continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" he said. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nFive people had died due to the storm as of Monday night, including a truck driver on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office. In Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night.\n\nIn southern Georgia, a 19-year-old man died Monday afternoon when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n\nMore than 140,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp. Nearly 12,000 more were without power in South Carolina early Tuesday.\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were also canceled nationwide on Monday and more than 550 flights were canceled early Tuesday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved a request from South Carolina's governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he has asked Biden to issue a preemptive federal emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to the state.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris postponed a campaign stop scheduled for Thursday in Savannah.\n\nNorth Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed Monday. Several areas along the state's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.\n\n___\n\nMartin reported from Atlanta.

Here's how much rain could fall", "body": "Northern Florida, the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina and parts of North Carolina are bracing for severe rain and catastrophic flooding this week as the Debby storm system moves up and east.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on the Big Bend coast of Florida early Monday, first hitting the small community of Steinhatchee. It damaged homes and businesses, sent floodwaters rising, caused sweeping power outages across the state and Georgia and led to several fatalities. Debby was downgraded to a tropical storm midday Monday.\n\nBut experts say the worst is yet to come as the storm system is expected to stall over the Southeast region.\n\nHow much rain is expected?\n\nForecasters say the system could pummel the Southeast with widespread areas of up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain and some totaling up to 30 inches (76 centimeters).\n\nThat would be a record-setting rainfall, shattering the record from a tropical system in 2018's Hurricane Florence. More than 23 inches (58 centimeters) of rain was recorded in South Carolina after that storm hit the Carolinas.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, \"It really is worthy of a Category 3 or 4 rating, if you want to talk about rainfall impacts,\" said Jeff Masters, founder of Weather Underground, now with Yale Climate Connections. \"That's going to cause a lot of damage.\"\n\nWhat areas are at risk?\n\nNorthern Florida as well as low-lying areas including Savannah, Georgia, and Hilton Head Island and Charleston, South Carolina, are expected to see the most severe flooding. North Carolina could also be impacted.\n\nOfficials in Savannah warned the area could see a month's worth of rain in four days if the system stalls.

It damaged homes and businesses, sent floodwaters rising, caused sweeping power outages across the state and Georgia and led to several fatalities. Debby was downgraded to a tropical storm midday Monday.\n\nBut experts say the worst is yet to come as the storm system is expected to stall over the Southeast region.\n\nForecasters say the system could pummel the Southeast with widespread areas of up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain and some totaling up to 30 inches (76 centimeters).\n\nThat would be a record-setting rainfall, shattering the record from a tropical system in 2018's Hurricane Florence. More than 23 inches (58 centimeters) of rain was recorded in South Carolina after that storm hit the Carolinas.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, \"It really is worthy of a Category 3 or 4 rating, if you want to talk about rainfall impacts,\" said Jeff Masters, founder of Weather Underground, now with Yale Climate Connections. \"That\u00b4s going to cause a lot of damage.\"\n\nA home in Rubonia, Fla., is surrounded by floodwater after Tropical Storm Debby swept through the area, Monday, Aug. 5, 2024, in Bradenton, Fla.

Both Savannah and Charleston announced curfews Monday night into Tuesday.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday.\n\nIn addition to the curfew, the city of Charleston's emergency plan includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding.\n\nIn Edisto Beach, South Carolina, a tornado touched down Monday night, damaging trees, homes and taking down power lines, the Colleton County Sheriff's Office said on social media. No injuries were immediately reported, officials said.\n\nThe National Weather Service continued issuing tornado warnings well into Monday night for parts of the state including in the island town of Hilton Head.\n\nDebby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It has weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, drenching and bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across portions of eastern Georgia, the coastal plain of South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Wednesday.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said in a social media post. Just north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said on social media.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that the state could continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" he said. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nFive people had died due to the storm as of Monday night, including a truck driver on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office. In Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night.\n\nIn southern Georgia, a 19-year-old man died Monday afternoon when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n\nNearly 160,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday night, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were also canceled nationwide on Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved a request from South Carolina's governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he has asked Biden to issue a preemptive federal emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to the state.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris postponed a campaign stop scheduled for Thursday in Savannah.\n\nNorth Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed Monday. Several areas along the state's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.\n\n___\n\nMartin reported from Atlanta.

(Stephen B. Morton / AP)\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon after Tropical Storm Debby made landfill, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nRepublican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said about 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\nWith Tropical Storm Debby's winds and rain expected to worsen overnight, officials for Savannah, Georgia, and surrounding Chatham County announced that an overnight curfew will take effect at 10 p.m. Monday and run to 6 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said the region can expect rain that could exceed 20 inches.\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2-to-4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. \"We don't know what that looks like. So, we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also distributed about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nDeSantis warned that just because Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's Gulf coast near Steinhatchee, a small community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nThe storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow as it turns to the east.\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, said there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide would be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed because of flooding, as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts - and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains.\n\n\"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rain across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches above normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It didn't say where the cocaine was found.\n\nNearly 30% of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"},

Forecasters warned heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, announces curfew, roads into historic city to be closed\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, officials announced a curfew starting at 11 p.m. Monday for the peninsula that makes up much of downtown and the older parts of the 350-year-old city as some of the heaviest rain from Tropical Storm Debby is expected to fall overnight.\n\nPolice will barricade all eight roads leading into the peninsula and only let essential workers and emergency personnel in or out. High-water vehicles will also be staged to go into the area as needed, Charleston Mayor William Cogswell said at a Monday evening news conference.\n\n\"We need people to make their way out. This is not something you can stay at the bar until 10:45. We need you to take this seriously,\" Cogswell said.\n\nThe mayor said forecasters told him 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain could fall in Charleston overnight.\n\nCity officials will assess the situation early Tuesday and decide how and when to reopen roads and lift the curfew.\n\nNo evacuations planned for now in South Carolina, officials say\n\nState officials don't plan any evacuations in South Carolina for now as Tropical Storm Debby slowly spins toward the state.\n\nLarge-scale evacuations typically bring people inland from the coast, and forecasters say Debby's biggest impacts could be as much as 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain in localized areas throughout the state, causing floodwaters to rise quickly in small areas. So any evacuations will up to local leaders.\n\n\"This storm may not have the high winds of a hurricane, but it has the potential to cause life-threatening floods across the state. And I would like to emphasize that Tropical Storm Debby is not just a coastal event, but it is a statewide event,\" state Emergency Management Division Director Kim Stenson said at a Monday afternoon news conference.\n\nBiden approves request from South Carolina's governor for emergency declaration\n\nThe White House said Monday that President Joe Biden has approved a request from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said personnel from the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard are deploying to the region and are prepared to support recovery efforts.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday ahead of Debby's anticipated rainfall. Flooding and power outages are expected to start Tuesday and continue through the rest of the week, according to North Carolina Emergency Management officials.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis previously had declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida's 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also had made his own emergency declaration.\n\nCurfew announced for Savannah and surrounding county as Debby approaches\n\nWith Debby's winds and rains expected to worsen overnight, officials for Savannah and surrounding Chatham County announced that an overnight curfew will take effect at 10 p.m. Monday and run to 6 a.m. Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nFlorida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.\n\nNo deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nMayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island: Don't let your guard down\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nIn saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rainsFeatured Local Savings\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nPackages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nDebby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nBiden briefed on Debby's progress\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 50 mph (85 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was near the Florida-Georgia border and was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to decrease in speed as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nBig worry is storm surge from Debby\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nHundreds of thousands without power\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\n-- -\n\nThis version corrects the attribution for power outage figures to PowerOutage.us, not PowerOutage.com.", "source": {"uri":

Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.\n\nNo deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nMayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island: Don't let your guard down\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nIn saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nPackages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nDebby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nBiden briefed on Debby's progress\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 50 mph (85 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was near the Florida-Georgia border and was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to decrease in speed as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nBig worry is storm surge from Debby\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nHundreds of thousands without power\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\n-- -\n\nThis version corrects the attribution for power outage figures to PowerOutage.us, not PowerOutage.com.", "source": {"uri":

Here's how much rain could fall", "body": "Northern Florida, the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina and parts of North Carolina are bracing for severe rain and catastrophic flooding this week as the Debby storm system moves up and east.\n\nNorthern Florida, the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina and parts of North Carolina are bracing for severe rain and catastrophic flooding this week as the Debby storm system moves up and east.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on the Big Bend coast of Florida early Monday, first hitting the small community of Steinhatchee. It damaged homes and businesses, sent floodwaters rising, caused sweeping power outages across the state and Georgia and led to several fatalities. Debby was downgraded to a tropical storm midday Monday.\n\nBut experts say the worst is yet to come as the storm system is expected to stall over the Southeast region.\n\nHow much rain is expected?\n\nForecasters say the system could pummel the Southeast with widespread areas of up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain and some totaling up to 30 inches (76 centimeters).\n\nThat would be a record-setting rainfall, shattering the record from a tropical system in 2018's Hurricane Florence. More than 23 inches (58 centimeters) of rain was recorded in South Carolina after that storm hit the Carolinas.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, \"It really is worthy of a Category 3 or 4 rating, if you want to talk about rainfall impacts,\" said Jeff Masters, founder of Weather Underground, now with Yale Climate Connections. \"That's going to cause a lot of damage.\"\n\nWhat areas are at risk?\n\nNorthern Florida as well as low-lying areas including Savannah, Georgia, and Hilton Head Island and Charleston, South Carolina, are expected to see the most severe flooding. North Carolina could also be impacted.\n\nOfficials in Savannah warned the area could see a month's worth of rain in four days if the system stalls. There were also flooding concerns for Tybee Island, Georgia's largest public beach 18 miles (28.97 kilometers) east of Savannah. On top of any torrential downpours that Debby dishes out, the island could get even wetter from 2 to 4 feet of storm surge, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Hilton Head Island Mayor Alan Perry said on a video posted to Facebook. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.\n\nFew places in South Carolina are as susceptible to flooding as Charleston. Much of the city and surrounding areas founded in 1670 were built on land created by using fill dirt and other debris. Rising sea levels cause a number of minor flooding events even without a storm and like many coastal cities, Charleston can't drain well.\n\nThe city doesn't expect a massive amount of flooding from the ocean, but the storm is still dangerous. Heavy rain can back up into the city, also causing flooding.\n\nWhat's causing this storm to stall?\n\nSome hurricanes make landfall and move quickly, experts say, while others slow substantially.\n\n\"Really what happened, and why the storm has stalled, is because there's basically high pressure areas to the west of the storm and to the northeast, and that's kind of pinned the storm,\" said Phil Klotzbach, senior research scientist at Colorado State University's Department of Atmospheric Science. \"With a hurricane you always have wind problems, but when you have a storm moving at 3 to 5 miles an hour, it's going to be over any specific location for a very long period of time, so flash flooding and just tremendous rainfall totals are going to be very likely.\"\n\nExperts say the warming atmosphere plays a role in the severity of storm surges such as Debby.\n\nWarming water in the northeast Gulf of Mexico is increasing Hurricane Debby's heavy rains, as more moisture evaporates from the waters, Masters said. Some research says climate change can impact the forward motion of hurricanes, he added, making them go slower.\n\n\"It's something we've been seeing more of lately,\" Masters said.\n\nHow long could this last?\n\nThe worst of the rain is expected during the first half of the week, but it could last through Saturday, forecasters said.\n\n___\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit.

However, with the storm slowing down even more, Debby will stay stuck over the Southeast for the better part of this week, meandering over Georgia and the Carolinas.\n\nEven though the storm is expected to weaken a bit more overnight, Debby is still expected to bring historic rainfall and life-threatening flooding to portions of southeastern Georgia and the coastal areas of the Carolinas over the next few days. Rainfall totals from this event are expected to reach between 10 and 20 inches.\n\nAlready, portions of southeastern Georgia and South Carolina have seen between 3 to 6 inches of rainfall, but with rainfall rates of 1.5 to 3 inches per hour possible, flood alerts remain in effect.\n\nA Flash Flood Warning was issued for Charleston, South Carolina, where rainfall rates between 1.5 and 2.5 inches are expected. Ongoing or new flooding is expected, with an additional 2 to 4 inches of rain possible over the next few hours.\n\nAs onshore flow continues, storm surge remains an issue in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina. Storm surge alerts remain in effect up the Georgia and Carolina coastlines.\n\nRainfall aside, Debby could also generate some spin-up tornadoes as it swirls over the Georgia-South Carolina border tonight. As a result, a Tornado Watch also remains in effect for parts of southeastern Georgia and South Carolina until 1 a.m. ET.\n\nOver the next 48 hours, Debby is expected to meander back over the Atlantic but will continue to hug the coastline before heading back inland over the Carolinas again. Slight strengthening can't entirely be ruled out as it moves back over water, but ultimately, Debby is expected to weaken once it moves back inland. Strength aside, it will still bring significant rainfall to portions of the Southeast, which will likely lead to catastrophic flooding in some areas.\n\nDebby is expected to eventually drift toward the north/northeast by the end of the week into the weekend. As it heads north, it will likely weaken to a tropical depression or remnant low. Regardless, heavy rainfall is still expected up the I-95 corridor heading into this weekend.\n\nPower returns to some Florida customers as Debby moves northeast\n\nAs of Monday evening, 146,034 customers are without power in Florida, according to the latest update from a U.S. power outage map.\n\nThis marks an improvement from Monday morning, which saw nearly 300,000 customers without power at 9:50 a.m. ET, the height of outages across the state.\n\nDuring a press conference in Tallahassee Monday morning, Gov. Ron DeSantis said the state's emergency department had 17,000 linemen working to restore power in the wake of the storm.\n\n\"We have a lot of restoration personnel ready to go,\" DeSantis said.\n\nDebby weakening, but threats of tornadoes, heavy rain continue\n\nTropical Storm Debby continues to weaken, with maximum sustained winds down to 45 mph as of 8 p.m. ET. The weather pattern is moving very slowly to the northeast at 6 mph, and the center is currently about 50 miles east of Valdosta, Georgia.\n\nEven though Debby is now inland and continues to weaken, many of the impacts -- especially the heavy rainfall and dangerous flash flood threat -- will not abate for several days. For many locations in coastal Georgia and South Carolina, the worst is yet to come.\n\nThe tornado threat continues along portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts this evening and into tonight. A Tornado Watch remains in effect from Savannah, Georgia, to Charleston, South Carolina, until at least 1 a.m. ET.\n\nParts of Florida, including Sarasota and Lakewood Ranch, are reporting over a foot of rain from Debby, and portions of Suwannee County, including Live Oak, are getting around a foot as well.\n\nSo far, parts of Georgia, including Savannah, are reporting nearly 4'' of rain. The same can be said for Hilton Head, South Carolina.\n\nConditions will continue to deteriorate across much of South Carolina overnight Monday into Tuesday, with widespread areas of heavy rain and the potential for dangerous, significant flash flooding during nighttime hours.\n\nCoastal flooding and storm surges will continue to increase in the coming hours as winds increase and more persistent heavy rain moves in, heading into high tide along the Georgia and South Carolina coasts.\n\nBy late Tuesday afternoon or early evening, the center of Debby will likely be moving off the Southeast coast and into the Atlantic, where it will meander for about 24 hours before likely turning back toward the coast and potentially making another landfall as a tropical storm somewhere along the South Carolina coast by Thursday morning or afternoon.\n\nMore than 163,000 customers without power in Florida\n\nMore than 163,000 customers are without power in Florida, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks energy outages.\n\nCurfew set for Charleston, South Carolina\n\nA curfew will go into effect overnight for Charleston, South Carolina, due to Debby, city officials said Monday.\n\nThoroughfares leading into the peninsula will be closed from 11 p.m. ET Monday to noon ET Tuesday, the city said, as the region braces for potential impacts such as tropical storm-force winds, heavy rain and isolated tornadoes.\n\n\"We urge everybody to stay inside, stay indoors and do not travel,\" Charleston Mayor William Cogswell said at a press briefing Monday evening.\n\nBiden approves emergency declaration request from South Carolina\n\nPresident Joe Biden has approved a request from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration in the state due to Debby, the White House said.\n\nThe declaration allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency to mobilize and provide equipment and resources necessary.\n\n\"The President continues to urge residents to remain vigilant and heed the warnings of State and local officials,\" the White House said in a statement.\n\nNorth Carolina governor declares state of emergency\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency ahead of severe weather, including life-threatening flash flooding, expected across the state due to Debby.\n\n\"This weather has the potential to bring intense rain and flooding to North Carolina and we are preparing for it,\" Cooper said in a statement. \"As the weather becomes more severe, I urge everyone to take precautions and stay safe.\"\n\nThe emergency declaration will allow for the state to mobilize resources to respond to the storm.\n\nTropical Storm Debby slowing down as it moves across US\n\nTropical Storm Debby continues to weaken and slow down in forward speed as the center moves near the Florida-Georgia state line as of 5 p.m. ET.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are down to 50 mph, and Debby is moving to the northeast at 6 mph. The center is currently about 30 miles southeast of Valdosta, Georgia.\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, all tropical weather and storm surge alerts have been canceled across Florida's Gulf Coast as conditions improve across much of the state.\n\nDebby will move across southeastern Georgia through Monday evening, with the worst impacts focused there and into the Jacksonville, Florida, area. Heavy rain continues to overspread southern South Carolina as well.\n\nMore than 199,000 customers are without power in Florida, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks energy outages.\n\nLatest forecast\n\nDebby is moving inland across north Florida Monday afternoon after dumping more than 1 foot of rain in the state.\n\nTornadoes are possible Monday afternoon in Florida, including in Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville, as well as in the coastal cities of Savannah, Georgia, and Beaufort, South Carolina.\n\nThe biggest concern this week is flash flooding from the widespread, relentless rain. A flash flood emergency remains in effect in Suwannee County, Florida, northwest of Gainesville, where 10 to 15 inches of rain has fallen so far.\n\nDebby will slowly churn into southeastern Georgia throughout Monday afternoon and evening. Conditions will deteriorate in Savannah, Georgia, throughout the day.\n\nAt least four people have been killed from Debby, authorities said.\n\n13-year-old boy was killed when a tree fell on a mobile home Monday morning in Levy County, Florida, which encompasses Cedar Key, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with this family as they deal with this tragedy,\" the sheriff's office said in a statement. \"We encourage everyone to use extreme caution as they begin to assess and clean up the damage. Downed powerlines and falling trees are among the many hazards.\"\n\nIn Hillsborough County, Florida, which encompasses Tampa, a driver of a semi was killed when the truck went into a canal off Interstate 275 Monday morning, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office.\n\nDeputies recovered the semi and found the driver dead inside the cab, authorities said.\n\n\"It's just heartbreaking,\" Tampa Mayor Jane Castor told ABC News Live. \"We really ask everyone, one, to be aware of the weather situations in your area, and then heed the warnings. Especially the high wind and the water.\"\n\nIn Dixie County, Florida, a driver \"lost control due to the inclement weather and wet roadway\" on Sunday night, crashing into the center median guardrail and then overturning the car, the Florida Highway Patrol said.\n\nThe driver, a 38-year-old woman, and a passenger, a 12-year-old boy, were killed, authorities said.\n\nAnother passenger, a 14-year-old boy, was seriously injured, the highway patrol said.\n\nFlash flood emergency issued in Suwannee County, Florida\n\nA flash flood emergency has been issued in Suwannee County in north Florida, northwest of Gainesville, where officials are reporting that water is entering structures.\n\nTen to 15 inches of rain has inundated the county so far and another 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected.\n\nMore than 1,600 flights have been canceled within, into or out of the U.S. on Monday, and that number is expected to continue to climb.\n\nAmerican Airlines is seeing the biggest impacts because of its hubs in Miami and Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nAmerican Airlines said it canceled operations at airports in Gainesville, Sarasota and Tallahassee until noon on Monday.\n\nSunday was one of the worst air travel days of the year with more than 2,400 cancellations.\n\nBiden briefed on storm\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed Monday morning on the administration's ongoing response to Debby, according to a White House official.\n\nOn Saturday, Biden approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and deployed rescue personnel, meals and water, the official said.\n\nThe Biden administration is in touch with officials from Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.

Ron DeSantis warned Monday.\n\nSignificant flooding has already impacted the Bradenton and Sarasota County area up to North Florida, he said.\n\nMore than 250,000 customers without power in Florida\n\nMore than 250,000 customers are without power in Florida Monday morning, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks energy outages.\n\nDebby makes landfall in Florida\n\nHurricane Debby made landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida, on Monday morning, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers without power in Florida, tracker says\n\nMore than 135,000 customers were without power in Florida early Monday, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks energy outages.\n\nDebby approaches landfall with 80 mph winds\n\nHurricane Debby is \"very near\" landfall along Florida's Gulf Coast, the National Hurricane Center said at 5 a.m. ET.\n\n\"Expected to bring life-threatening storm surge in portions of Florida and major flooding in the southeastern United States,\" the center said in an update.\n\nThe Category 1 storm had maximum sustained winds of an about 80 mph as it approached Big Bend, a northern area near the Panhandle, the center said.\n\nDebby strengthens, with maximum sustained winds up to 80 mph\n\nHurricane Debby continued to strengthen, with maximum sustained winds rising to 80 mph, making it a Category 1 hurricane, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nMore than 10 inches of rain fell on the west coast of Florida, around the Tampa Bay area, where water rescues have been on going near Clearwater. Significant flooding also has been reported in Fort Myers area.\n\nStorm surge has been rising quickly now along the Big Bend area in Florida, from Cedar Key to Keaton Beach, where up to 10 feet of Gulf water could inundate the coastline. The storm is forecast to make landfall in that area on Monday morning.\n\nCoast Guard rescues two adrift in sailboat off Florida coast\n\nTwo people were rescued Sunday from a boat that was adrift in about 20-foot seas off the coast of Boca Grande, Florida, the U.S. Coast Guard said.\n\nThe boaters were airlifted from their 34-foot sailboat after the vessel lost its sail about 73 miles off shore, the guard said.\n\nThe sailboat had been on course for Tarpon Springs from Key West, officials said. A friend of the boaters contacted the Coast Guard at about 5 p.m. Saturday, telling officials they had missed their check-in.\n\n\"We received an updated satellite position from the boaters' friend, which led to them being successfully located,\" Lt. Cmdr. Christopher Hooper, a search and rescue mission coordinator, said in a statement.\n\nThe boaters were rescued by a crew on an Air Station Clearwater MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter at about 11 a.m. on Sunday, the Coast Guard said. They had been adrift in seas that were between 15 and 20 feet, with wind speeds at about 50 knots. Visibility was low.\n\nThe names of the people on the boat were not released.\n\nDebby strengthens into a hurricane\n\nThe National Hurricane Center has upgraded Tropical Storm Debby to a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 75 mph.\n\nThe forecast is still on track for more strengthening overnight as Debby feeds off the warm water in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Water temperatures running 3 to 5 degrees above average are providing plenty of fuel for this storm to intensify before landfall, which will happen around 7 a.m. ET along the Big Bend region of Florida.\n\nTropical Storm Debby nearing hurricane strength at 70 mph\n\nWhile still a tropical storm, Debby is nearing hurricane strength, producing maximum sustained wind speeds up to 70 mph.\n\nDebby will continue to intensify rapidly overnight as it travels northward over the Gulf's warm waters. It is forecast to become a hurricane tonight. It is expected to strengthen to at least a strong Category 1 hurricane before making landfall along Florida's Big Bend region Monday morning (around 7 a.m. ET), producing sustained wind speeds near 85 mph and wind gusts reaching over 100 mph possible.\n\nLocated about 90 miles southwest of Cedar Key, Florida, the storm continues to impact the Florida Gulf Coast with heavy rainfall, storm surge, powerful winds and even spin-up tornadoes.\n\nA reported wind gust of 56 mph was reported in St. Petersburg, with two tornadoes reported in central Florida.\n\nA 60-mph wind gust was also reported near Sarasota, Florida.\n\nNumerous reports of flooding from heavy rainfall and surges have also been submitted up Florida's Gulf Coast.\n\nThe Tornado Watch covering much of northern and central Florida and southern Georgia has been extended until 6 a.m. ET on Monday.\n\nOnce Debby moves over land, it will weaken. However, the lack of a steering current will cause the storm to slow down considerably. While its exact track remains questionable, model guidance suggests the storm will drift over the Atlantic or Southeast coastline late Monday night into Tuesday before meandering back over Georgia and the Carolinas. Interaction with the Atlantic could reenergize Debby, but that will greatly depend on the storm's path.\n\nEven though Debby's track and timing remain uncertain later this week, there is high confidence that it will bring historic rainfall and significant flooding across portions of the Southeast.\n\nRainfall ranging between 6 to 12 inches is possible from Florida's Big Bend region through southeastern Georgia and into the Carolinas. Parts of coastal Georgia and South Carolina will be in the bullseye for the heaviest rainfall. There, widespread totals between 10 to 20 inches are possible, with some places even seeing up to 30 inches locally. Because of this, significant urban and river flooding is anticipated.\n\nRainfall aside, hurricane and tropical storm force winds will continue to whip across Florida and will likely intensify Sunday night into Monday as the storm moves closer to the coast -- with areas just south and east of the storm's eyewall seeing the strongest gusts early Monday morning.\n\nStorm surge will also worsen along Florida's northern and central Gulf coast tonight into Monday morning, with the highest surge expected between Suwannee River and Ochlockonee River (6 to 10 feet).\n\nAll tropical alerts remain unchanged from the last update.\n\nTropical Storm Debby on track to become a hurricane overnight\n\nAs of 5 p.m. ET on Sunday, Tropical Storm Debby still has winds of 65 mph and is forecast to undergo rapid intensification into a hurricane overnight, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nDebby is expected to make landfall as a hurricane in Florida's Big Bend region on Monday morning around 7 a.m.\n\nRain is expected to be the most impactful element from this storm, affecting a wide area over an extended period of time.\n\n\"Across portions of southeast Georgia and South Carolina, 10 to 20 inches of rainfall, with local amounts to 30 inches, are expected through Friday morning,\" the National Hurricane Center said. \"This potentially historic rainfall will likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding.\"\n\nEvacuations ordered in Alachua County, Florida, as Debby set to make landfall\n\nAn evacuation order was issued Sunday for residents of Alachua County, Florida, residing in mobile homes, manufactured homes and recreational vehicles ahead of the arrival of Debby, which is forecast to be a hurricane when it makes landfall on Monday.\n\nPeople living in areas close to rivers and lakes, and low-lying areas that tend to flood in Alachua County are also encouraged to evacuate, according to a statement issued by county officials.\n\nGainesville is the largest city in Alachua County.\n\n\"We encourage residents affected to find alternative housing with friends, family or short-term rentals,\" according to the county's statement.\n\nAlachua County is opening three shelters for residents in need.\n\nTornado watch issued as Debby runs parallel to Florida's Gulf Coast\n\nA tornado watch was issued Sunday afternoon by the National Weather Service as Tropical Storm Debbie moved northward in the Gulf of Mexico parallel to Florida's Gulf Coast.\n\nAt 2 p.m. Sunday, the National Hurricane Center said Debby was still a tropical storm with winds of 65 mph and forecasted to bring severe weather, including heavy rain, to coastal communities Sunday afternoon.\n\nA tornado watch is in effect for much of Florida through Sunday evening.\n\nDebby is expected to become a hurricane Sunday evening and will likely make landfall sometime between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. Monday in the Big Bend area of Florida's Panhandle.\n\nOnce Debby makes landfall, the storm is expected to slow down and essentially stall over the Southeast, dropping potentially historic amounts of rainfall as it moves into Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nA hurricane warning is in effect for the west coast of Florida from the Ochlockonee River southwest of Tallahassee to the Suwannee River northwest of Gainesville.\n\nMore than 1,600 flights canceled due to Debby and Northeast thunderstorms\n\nTropical Storm Debby and thunderstorms in the Northeast were causing airlines to cancel or delay flights on Sunday.\n\nAmerican Airlines said it canceled 601 flights, or about 16% of its flights, on Sunday, the most of any airline.\n\nDebby, now a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico, is expected to make landfall around the Big Bend area of the Florida Panhandle on Monday morning as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nAlso causing delays and cancellations were severe thunderstorms moving up the East Coast. Parts of the mid-Atlantic states are under a severe thunderstorm watch until 9 p.m. ET Sunday, including the cities of Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City.\n\nThe most flights canceled on Sunday were at Charlotte Douglas International Airport, where 214 flights were canceled and another 172 were delayed, according to FlightAware.\n\nIn New York City, LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy international airports reported a combined 363 flights canceled and 258 delayed on Sunday.\n\nMiami International Airport reported 209 canceled flights and 151 delayed fights. Airports in Orlando, Tampa, Philadelphia, Newark, Washington, D.C., and Dallas-Fort Worth all reported more than 100 flight cancellations on Sunday.\n\nTen million people under tropical storm alert on Florida's Gulf Coast\n\nAbout 10 million people along Florida's west coast and up through Georgia and South and North Carolina were under a tropical storm alert Sunday as Debby took aim at the area and is forecast to make landfall in the Panhandle region on Monday.\n\nDebby, now a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico about 190 miles southwest of Tampa, is expected to make landfall sometime between 7 and 8 a.m. in Big Bend on the Florida Panhandle as a Category 1 hurricane, state emergency officials said.\n\nDebby is expected to create a storm surge of 4 to 7 feet in Cedar Key and Crystal River on the Florida west coast and a 2- to 5-foot storm surge farther south in Tampa and Sarasota.\n\nThe storm is forecast to move into the cities of Tallahassee and Jacksonville, bringing up to 20 inches of rain to some parts, before causing potential flooding in Georgia and the Carolinas on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nNational Guard put on alert for search and rescue: DeSantis\n\nMembers of the Florida National Guard have been advised to be prepared to conduct search-and-rescue missions once Tropical Storm Debby makes landfall on Monday, according to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nWidespread flooding is expected for the Florida Panhandle region, particularly in the Big Bend area where Debby is expected to make landfall Monday morning as a category 1 hurricane, DeSantis said during a news conference Sunday morning.\n\nDeSantis said the Florida National Guard and the state's Emergency Response Team are prepared to conduct search-and-rescue and provide humanitarian assistance.\n\n\"The Florida National Guard is standing by with 3,000 service members ready to assist the state Emergency Response Team, which includes search-and-rescue, route clearance, commodity distribution and protection of critical infrastructure,\" DeSantis said.\n\nThe governor said at least 12 swift boat crews and flat-bottom jon boat crews are also standing by to help with rescues.\n\nHe said that more than 30,000 bottles of water, more than 160,000 meals and nearly 14,000 tarps have been pre-staged in parts of Florida that are expected to be hit hard by the storm.\n\nDeSantis said Florida utility companies have notified up to 17,000 linemen to be ready to spring into action once it is safe to repair any damage.\n\nFlooding forecast as Debby expected to bring up to 20 inches of rain\n\nFlorida residents in the Big Bend region of the Panhandle were warned Sunday that Debby is going to bring \"catastrophic rain to the area\" that will cause flooding and power outages.\n\nKevin Guthrie, director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, said during a news conference on Sunday that once the Debby makes landfall as a possible Category 1 hurricane on Monday morning, winds will subside quickly, but the slow-moving storm will produce an abundance of rain.\n\n\"We're going to be in a catastrophic rain situation where we have situations in Florida that will receive 15, maybe as high as 20 inches of rain,\" Guthrie said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis told residents who are in the path of the storm to expect widespread power outages.\n\n\"It's possible that you could have serious intensification between now and landfall. It could get up to 85, 90 and 95 mph sustained winds. That is absolutely possible, particularly in parts of the state like here in Tallahassee. There's going to be a lot of trees that are going to fall down and you're going to have debris. You are going to have power interruptions,\" the governor said.\n\nGov. DeSantis advises residents to make final preparations for Debby\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis advised residents of the state's Panhandle region on Sunday that they should be finalizing preparations for when Tropical Storm Debby makes its anticipated landfall Monday morning as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\n\"Now this is a storm that is potentially dangerous. Residents should be finalizing all of their preparations now,\" DeSantis said during a news conference at the state's Emergency Operation Center in Tallahassee.\n\nDeSantis said Tropical Storm Debby was in the Gulf of Mexico about 190 miles southwest of Tampa as of Sunday morning with sustained winds of about 50 mph.\n\n\"But those are expected to increase,\" DeSantis said. \"Tropical Storm Debby is likely to become a Category 1 hurricane before making landfall in the Big Bend region of Florida.\"\n\nHe said the storm was on a similar track taken by Hurricane Idalia in 2023. Idalia made landfall in Big Bend on Aug. 30, 2023, as a Category 3 hurricane and caused a devastating storm surge of 7 to 12 feet across the coastal Big Bend region in Levy, Dixie and Taylor counties.\n\n\"This storm is a similar track,\" DeSantis said. \"It may be a tick to the west of that. It very well may have greater impacts here in the Tallahassee region than Hurricane Idalia did. Once it crosses landfall and enters the Florida Panhandle/Big Bend Region, wherever it does, it's going to move very slowly across northern Florida and southeast Georgia.\"", "source": {"uri":

Governor Ron DeSantis said that some 250,000 residents in his state were without power as of Monday morning (AFP)\n\nTropical Storm Debby drenched Florida on Monday, killing at least four people and threatening southeastern US states with heavy rainfall and catastrophic flooding.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died when a tree was blown onto a mobile home in Levy County, the sheriff's office there said, after Debby made landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast earlier Monday as a Category One hurricane.\n\nAuthorities said a truck driver was killed after his 18-wheeler plunged into a canal in Hillsborough County, while a 38-year-old woman and 12-year-old boy died in a car crash in Dixie County.\n\nThe storm moved into Georgia overnight and is expected to go offshore before approaching the South Carolina coast on Thursday, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC).\n\n\"This is a level four out of four risk for excessive rainfall,\" Michael Brennan, director of the NHC, told reporters.\n\n\"This is going to result in a prolonged extreme rainfall event with potential for catastrophic flooding across coastal portions of Georgia, South Carolina, even extending up into North Carolina,\" he added.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis said that some 250,000 residents in his state were without power.\n\n\"Please, be very cautious when you're going out,\" he said, adding that Debby's winds had not been as damaging as previous hurricanes that have hit Florida.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has approved emergency declarations for Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, allowing for federal assistance in coordinating disaster relief efforts.\n\nDeSantis also activated his state's National Guard, with more than 3,000 service members mobilized to help with storm response.\n\nBy Monday evening, the NHC said the storm was registering maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph) as it swept into Georgia.\n\nStorm surge warnings -- signalling a life-threatening inundation from rising water -- are in effect in parts of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.\n\nDebby was expected to bring \"potentially historic rainfall\" of up to 30 inches as it moved north, the NHC said.\n\nBut it said the storm was weakening after making landfall earlier with sustained speeds of 80 mph (130 kph) as a Category One hurricane -- the lowest on a scale of five.\n\nMandatory evacuations were ordered for part of Citrus County, Florida, with several other counties under voluntary evacuation orders, local media reported.\n\nThe governors of Georgia and South Carolina declared a state of emergency ahead of Debby's arrival.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris -- the Democratic candidate in the US election -- postponed events in North Carolina and Georgia this week due to the storm, according to local media reports citing her campaign team.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Border Patrol announced that Debby had washed up 25 packages of cocaine worth around $1 million to the coast of the Florida Keys, where they were seized.\n\nIn July, at least 18 people were killed when the powerful Hurricane Beryl tore through the Caribbean before hitting the southern US states of Texas and Louisiana.\n\nScientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of storms such as Beryl because there is more energy in a warmer ocean for them to feed on.",

The Florida Highway Patrol said a 14-year-old boy who was a passenger had serious injuries.\n\nMore than 300,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida governor Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 people were working to restore electricity. He told residents to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" Mr DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up.\"\n\nAirports were also affected. More than 1,600 flights had been cancelled nationwide, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.\n\nOne out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was cancelled on Monday. Nearly 30% of flights scheduled to leave Tampa International Airport were cancelled.\n\nSarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, was one of the hardest hit by flooding.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" said Sarasota County fire chief David Rathbun in a social media update.\n\nThe storm made landfall early Monday near Steinhatchee, Taylor County, a tiny community in northern Florida of fewer than 1,000 residents.\n\nSeveral roads were closed because of flooding, sheriff Wayne Padgett said. Trees and power lines had also fallen across some roads.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has postponed a scheduled trip to Georgia.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County interim emergency director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing on Monday.\n\nThe city of Charleston has an emergency plan in place that includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breaking News.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc",

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has moved menacingly into some of America's most historic Southern cities, bringing prolonged downpours and flooding Tuesday after slamming into Florida and prompting the rescue of hundreds from flooded homes.\n\nRecord-setting rain from the storm that killed at least five people in Florida and Georgia was causing flash flooding, with up to 25 inches (64 centimeters) possible in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said in its latest advisory Tuesday morning.\n\n\"Hunker down,\" Van Johnson, the mayor of Savannah, Georgia, told residents in a social media livestream Monday night. \"Expect that it will be a rough day\" on Tuesday, he said.\n\nThe storm's center was just southwest of Savannah early Tuesday with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (75 kph) and it was moving northeast at less than 6 mph (10 kph).\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" Richard Pasch of the National Hurricane Center said Tuesday morning. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nTropical cyclones derive their energy from warm water, so Debby has weakened over land, but part of the circulation was interacting with water over the Atlantic, Pasch said. The storm's center is expected to move out over the water off the Georgia and South Carolina coast, then move back inland, so it could restrengthen Wednesday before it moves inland Thursday over South Carolina, he said.\n\nMore than 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain had fallen through Monday at Savannah's airport, and showed no signs of stopping Tuesday, the National Weather Service reported. That's already a month's worth of rain in a single day: In all of August 2023, the city got 5.56 inches (14.1 centimeters) of rain.\n\nFlash flood warnings were issued in Savannah and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Both Savannah and Charleston announced overnight curfews as the rains picked up. Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday.\n\nCharleston authorities said police were barricading all eight roads leading into the 350-year-old city built on a marshy peninsula, letting only essential workers and emergency personnel in and urging all non-residents to leave Monday night.\n\n\"We need people to make their way out. This is not something you can stay at the bar until 10:45. We need you to take this seriously,\" Charleston Mayor William Cogswell said.\n\nCharleston also opened parking garages so residents could park their cars above floodwaters and updated an online mapping system to show which roads are closed due to flooding.\n\nA tornado touched down in Edisto Beach, South Carolina, Monday night, damaging homes and blowing down trees and power lines, the Colleton County Sheriff's Office said on social media. No injuries were immediately reported there officials said.\n\nThe weather service continued issuing tornado warnings well into Monday night for parts of the state including Hilton Head Island.\n\nAt the edge of Hilton Head Island, musician Nick Poulin wasn't overly concerned about Debby since his equipment was inside and he made sure that his car wasn't parked under trees so it won't be hit by falling branches.\n\n\"I'm born and raised here, so we've had plenty of storms,\" he said. \"It's usually not as bad as people hype it up to be.\"\n\nDebby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. Weakening winds made it a tropical storm again, but its slow forward movement and the the ocean water it picked up caused catastrophic in places. About 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department announced. Just north of Sarasota, Manatee County officials said 186 people were rescued.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said on social media.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis warned that Florida's threat is far from over as waterways north of the state line fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nFive people had died due to the storm as of Monday night, including a tractor trailer driver who lost control on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area, flipping over a concrete wall and dangling over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the body of the 64-year-old man from Mississippi in the cab, 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died when a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, Florida, and in Dixie County, near where Debby made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads. In south Georgia, a 19-year-old man died when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n\nMore than 140,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Tuesday morning, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp. Nearly 12,000 more were without power in South Carolina early Tuesday.\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were also canceled nationwide on Monday and more than 550 flights were canceled early Tuesday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved emergency declarations making federal disaster assistance available to Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris postponed a campaign stop scheduled for Thursday in Savannah.\n\nNorth Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed Monday. Several areas along the state's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.\n\nCollins reported from Columbia, South Carolina.

JOHN\n\nAugust 6, 2024 at 12:07 PM\n\nNorthern Florida, the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina and parts of North Carolina are bracing for severe rain and catastrophic flooding this week as the Debby storm system moves up and east.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on the Big Bend coast of Florida early Monday, first hitting the small community of Steinhatchee. It damaged homes and businesses, sent floodwaters rising, caused sweeping power outages across the state and Georgia and led to several fatalities. Debby was downgraded to a tropical storm midday Monday.\n\nBut experts say the worst is yet to come as the storm system is expected to stall over the Southeast region.\n\nHow much rain is expected?\n\nForecasters say the system could pummel the Southeast with widespread areas of up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain and some totaling up to 30 inches (76 centimeters).\n\nThat would be a record-setting rainfall, shattering the record from a tropical system in 2018's Hurricane Florence. More than 23 inches (58 centimeters) of rain was recorded in South Carolina after that storm hit the Carolinas.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, \"It really is worthy of a Category 3 or 4 rating, if you want to talk about rainfall impacts,\" said Jeff Masters, founder of Weather Underground, now with Yale Climate Connections. \"That's going to cause a lot of damage.\"\n\nWhat areas are at risk?\n\nNorthern Florida as well as low-lying areas including Savannah, Georgia, and Hilton Head Island and Charleston, South Carolina, are expected to see the most severe flooding. North Carolina could also be impacted.\n\nOfficials in Savannah warned the area could see a month's worth of rain in four days if the system stalls. There were also flooding concerns for Tybee Island, Georgia's largest public beach 18 miles (28.97 kilometers) east of Savannah. On top of any torrential downpours that Debby dishes out, the island could get even wetter from 2 to 4 feet of storm surge, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Hilton Head Island Mayor Alan Perry said on a video posted to Facebook. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.\n\nFew places in South Carolina are as susceptible to flooding as Charleston. Much of the city and surrounding areas founded in 1670 were built on land created by using fill dirt and other debris. Rising sea levels cause a number of minor flooding events even without a storm and like many coastal cities, Charleston can't drain well.\n\nThe city doesn't expect a massive amount of flooding from the ocean, but the storm is still dangerous. Heavy rain can back up into the city, also causing flooding.\n\nWhat's causing this storm to stall?\n\nSome hurricanes make landfall and move quickly, experts say, while others slow substantially.\n\n\"Really what happened, and why the storm has stalled, is because there's basically high pressure areas to the west of the storm and to the northeast, and that's kind of pinned the storm,\" said Phil Klotzbach, senior research scientist at Colorado State University's Department of Atmospheric Science. \"With a hurricane you always have wind problems, but when you have a storm moving at 3 to 5 miles an hour, it's going to be over any specific location for a very long period of time, so flash flooding and just tremendous rainfall totals are going to be very likely.\"\n\nExperts say the warming atmosphere plays a role in the severity of storm surges such as Debby.\n\nWarming water in the northeast Gulf of Mexico is increasing Hurricane Debby's heavy rains, as more moisture evaporates from the waters, Masters said. Some research says climate change can impact the forward motion of hurricanes, he added, making them go slower.\n\n\"It's something we've been seeing more of lately,\" Masters said.\n\nHow long could this last?\n\nThe worst of the rain is expected during the first half of the week, but it could last through Saturday, forecasters said.\n\n___\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit.

Savannah Mayor Van Johnson told residents to expect a rough day Tuesday. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, which is based on wind speeds, meteorologists say it's the storm's rainfall capacity that makes it extremely dangerous.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nDebby still getting energy from ocean water, expert says\n\nDebby has weakened over land because tropical cyclones derive their energy from warm water, but part of the circulation was still interacting Tuesday with water over the Atlantic, said Richard Pasch, a senior hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe storm's center is expected to move out over the water off the Georgia and South Carolina coast, then move back inland, so it could restrengthen, but it's not clear how much, he said.\n\nTropical storm warnings were posted from northeastern Florida up into North Carolina, and very heavy rain is expected, leading to catastrophic flooding across parts of southeastern Georgia, the eastern half of South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina through Friday, he said.\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" he said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nCharleston ready with sandbags, parking garages\n\nDebby's center was over southeastern Georgia early Tuesday with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (75 kph), and it was moving northeast near 7 mph (11 kph). The center is expected to move off Georgia's coast later Tuesday. Some strengthening is forecast on Wednesday and Thursday as Debby drifts offshore, before it moves inland over South Carolina on Thursday.\n\nThe emergency plan in the city of Charleston, South Carolina, includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters, and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed by flooding.\n\nHundreds rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, area, officials say\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said Monday in a social media post.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said in a social media update.\n\nJust north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"We are facing an unprecedented weather event with Hurricane Debby,\" said Jodie Fiske, Manatee County's public safety director. \"The safety of our residents is our top priority, and we are doing everything in our power to respond effectively to this crisis.\"\n\nMan killed when storm topples large tree onto home in south Georgia, officials say\n\nHeavy winds and rain associated with Debby toppled a large tree onto a porch at a home in south Georgia, killing a 19-year-old man, authorities said Monday.\n\nColquitt County Coroner C. Verlyn Brock said the man died at the home in the city of Moultrie, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Valdosta, Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.\n\nThe storm has damaged roofs and downed power lines in Moultrie, Police Chief Chad Castleberry told WALB-TV.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Debby had top winds near 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening as it moved slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns eastward.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Forecasters warned heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia.\n\nTropical Storm Debby has moved into the U.S. Southeast with what are likely to be long torrential downpours and flooding after raking Florida with heavy rain and high winds.\n\nThe storm killed at least five people on Monday and is causing flash flooding in historic Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, as well as elsewhere on the Southeast's Atlantic Coast. Savannah Mayor Van Johnson told residents to expect a rough day Tuesday. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, which is based on wind speeds, meteorologists say it's the storm's rainfall capacity that makes it extremely dangerous.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nDebby still getting energy from ocean water, expert says\n\nDebby has weakened over land because tropical cyclones derive their energy from warm water, but part of the circulation was still interacting Tuesday with water over the Atlantic, said Richard Pasch, a senior hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe storm's center is expected to move out over the water off the Georgia and South Carolina coast, then move back inland, so it could restrengthen, but it's not clear how much, he said.\n\nTropical storm warnings were posted from northeastern Florida up into North Carolina, and very heavy rain is expected, leading to catastrophic flooding across parts of southeastern Georgia, the eastern half of South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina through Friday, he said.\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" he said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nCharleston ready with sandbags, parking garages\n\nDebby's center was over southeastern Georgia early Tuesday with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (75 kph), and it was moving northeast near 7 mph (11 kph). The center is expected to move off Georgia's coast later Tuesday. Some strengthening is forecast on Wednesday and Thursday as Debby drifts offshore, before it moves inland over South Carolina on Thursday.\n\nThe emergency plan in the city of Charleston, South Carolina, includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters, and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed by flooding.\n\nHundreds rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, area, officials say\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said Monday in a social media post.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said in a social media update.\n\nJust north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"We are facing an unprecedented weather event with Hurricane Debby,\" said Jodie Fiske, Manatee County's public safety director. \"The safety of our residents is our top priority, and we are doing everything in our power to respond effectively to this crisis.\"\n\nMan killed when storm topples large tree onto home in south Georgia, officials say\n\nHeavy winds and rain associated with Debby toppled a large tree onto a porch at a home in south Georgia, killing a 19-year-old man, authorities said Monday.\n\nColquitt County Coroner C. Verlyn Brock said the man died at the home in the city of Moultrie, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Valdosta, Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.\n\nThe storm has damaged roofs and downed power lines in Moultrie, Police Chief Chad Castleberry told WALB-TV.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Debby had top winds near 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening as it moved slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns eastward.", "source": {"uri": "hjnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It damaged homes and businesses, sent floodwaters rising, caused sweeping power outages across the state and Georgia and led to several fatalities. Debby was downgraded to a tropical storm midday Monday.\n\nBut experts say the worst is yet to come as the storm system is expected to stall over the Southeast region.\n\nHow much rain is expected?\n\nForecasters say the system could pummel the Southeast with widespread areas of up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain and some totaling up to 30 inches (76 centimeters).\n\nThat would be a record-setting rainfall, shattering the record from a tropical system in 2018's Hurricane Florence. More than 23 inches (58 centimeters) of rain was recorded in South Carolina after that storm hit the Carolinas.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, \"It really is worthy of a Category 3 or 4 rating, if you want to talk about rainfall impacts,\" said Jeff Masters, founder of Weather Underground, now with Yale Climate Connections. \"That's going to cause a lot of damage.\"\n\nWhat areas are at risk?\n\nNorthern Florida as well as low-lying areas including Savannah, Georgia, and Hilton Head Island and Charleston, South Carolina, are expected to see the most severe flooding. North Carolina could also be impacted.\n\nOfficials in Savannah warned the area could see a month's worth of rain in four days if the system stalls. There were also flooding concerns for Tybee Island, Georgia's largest public beach 18 miles (28.97 kilometers) east of Savannah. On top of any torrential downpours that Debby dishes out, the island could get even wetter from 2 to 4 feet of storm surge, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Hilton Head Island Mayor Alan Perry said on a video posted to Facebook. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.\n\nFew places in South Carolina are as susceptible to flooding as Charleston. Much of the city and surrounding areas founded in 1670 were built on land created by using fill dirt and other debris. Rising sea levels cause a number of minor flooding events even without a storm and like many coastal cities, Charleston can't drain well.\n\nThe city doesn't expect a massive amount of flooding from the ocean, but the storm is still dangerous. Heavy rain can back up into the city, also causing flooding.\n\nWhat's causing this storm to stall?\n\nSome hurricanes make landfall and move quickly, experts say, while others slow substantially.\n\n\"Really what happened, and why the storm has stalled, is because there's basically high pressure areas to the west of the storm and to the northeast, and that's kind of pinned the storm,\" said Phil Klotzbach, senior research scientist at Colorado State University's Department of Atmospheric Science. \"With a hurricane you always have wind problems, but when you have a storm moving at 3 to 5 miles an hour, it's going to be over any specific location for a very long period of time, so flash flooding and just tremendous rainfall totals are going to be very likely.\"\n\nExperts say the warming atmosphere plays a role in the severity of storm surges such as Debby.\n\nWarming water in the northeast Gulf of Mexico is increasing Hurricane Debby's heavy rains, as more moisture evaporates from the waters, Masters said. Some research says climate change can impact the forward motion of hurricanes, he added, making them go slower.\n\n\"It's something we've been seeing more of lately,\" Masters said.\n\nHow long could this last?\n\nThe worst of the rain is expected during the first half of the week, but it could last through Saturday, forecasters said.\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "cbs6albany.com", "dataType":

Here's how much rain could fall", "body": "(AP) -- Northern Florida, the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina and parts of North Carolina are bracing for severe rain and catastrophic flooding this week as the Debby storm system moves up and east.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on the Big Bend coast of Florida early Monday, first hitting the small community of Steinhatchee. It damaged homes and businesses, sent floodwaters rising, caused sweeping power outages across the state and Georgia and led to several fatalities. Debby was downgraded to a tropical storm midday Monday.\n\nBut experts say the worst is yet to come as the storm system is expected to stall over the Southeast region.\n\nForecasters say the system could pummel the Southeast with widespread areas of up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain and some totaling up to 30 inches (76 centimeters).\n\nThat would be a record-setting rainfall, shattering the record from a tropical system in 2018's Hurricane Florence. More than 23 inches (58 centimeters) of rain was recorded in South Carolina after that storm hit the Carolinas.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, \"It really is worthy of a Category 3 or 4 rating, if you want to talk about rainfall impacts,\" said Jeff Masters, founder of Weather Underground, now with Yale Climate Connections. \"That's going to cause a lot of damage.\"\n\nNorthern Florida as well as low-lying areas including Savannah, Georgia, and Hilton Head Island and Charleston, South Carolina, are expected to see the most severe flooding. North Carolina could also be impacted.\n\nOfficials in Savannah warned the area could see a month's worth of rain in four days if the system stalls. There were also flooding concerns for Tybee Island, Georgia's largest public beach 18 miles (28.97 kilometers) east of Savannah. On top of any torrential downpours that Debby dishes out, the island could get even wetter from 2 to 4 feet of storm surge, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Hilton Head Island Mayor Alan Perry said on a video posted to Facebook. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.\n\nFew places in South Carolina are as susceptible to flooding as Charleston. Much of the city and surrounding areas founded in 1670 were built on land created by using fill dirt and other debris. Rising sea levels cause a number of minor flooding events even without a storm and like many coastal cities, Charleston can't drain well.\n\nThe city doesn't expect a massive amount of flooding from the ocean, but the storm is still dangerous. Heavy rain can back up into the city, also causing flooding.\n\nSome hurricanes make landfall and move quickly, experts say, while others slow substantially.\n\n\"Really what happened, and why the storm has stalled, is because there's basically high pressure areas to the west of the storm and to the northeast, and that's kind of pinned the storm,\" said Phil Klotzbach, senior research scientist at Colorado State University's Department of Atmospheric Science. \"With a hurricane you always have wind problems, but when you have a storm moving at 3 to 5 miles an hour, it's going to be over any specific location for a very long period of time, so flash flooding and just tremendous rainfall totals are going to be very likely.\"\n\nExperts say the warming atmosphere plays a role in the severity of storm surges such as Debby.\n\nWarming water in the northeast Gulf of Mexico is increasing Hurricane Debby's heavy rains, as more moisture evaporates from the waters, Masters said. Some research says climate change can impact the forward motion of hurricanes, he added, making them go slower.\n\n\"It's something we've been seeing more of lately,\" Masters said.\n\nThe worst of the rain is expected during the first half of the week, but it could last through Saturday, forecasters said.\n\n___\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit.

13-year-old kid died after a tree was thrown onto a mobile home in Levy County, according to the sheriff's office, just after Debby made landfall as a Category One hurricane on Florida's Gulf Coast earlier Monday.\n\nA truck driver was killed after his 18-wheeler crashed into a canal in Hillsborough County, while a 38-year-old lady and 12-year-old boy perished in a car accident in Dixie County.\n\nThe storm entered Georgia overnight and is anticipated to move offshore before striking the South Carolina coast on Thursday, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC).\n\n\"This is a level four out of four risk for excessive rainfall,\" Michael Brennan, director of the NHC, told reporters.\n\n\"This is going to result in a prolonged extreme rainfall event with potential for catastrophic flooding across coastal portions of Georgia, South Carolina, even extending up into North Carolina,\" he added.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis said that some 250,000 residents in his state were without power.\n\n\"Please, be very cautious when you're going out,\" he said, adding that Debby's winds had not been as damaging as previous hurricanes that have hit Florida.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has approved emergency declarations for Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, allowing for federal assistance in coordinating disaster relief efforts.\n\nDeSantis also activated his state's National Guard, with more than 3,000 service members mobilized to help with storm response.\n\nEvacuation orders\n\nAs the storm raced into Georgia on Monday evening, the National Hurricane Center reported maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph).\n\nStorm surge warnings, which indicate a life-threatening inundation from rising water, are in place in regions of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.\n\nDebby was projected to drop \"potentially historic rainfall\" of up to 30 inches as it traveled north, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nHowever, it stated that the storm was weakening after making landfall earlier with sustained winds of 80 mph (130 kph) as a Category One hurricane, the lowest on a scale of five.\n\nMandatory evacuations were ordered for a portion of Citrus County, Florida, with many additional counties under voluntary evacuation orders, according to local media.\n\nBefore Debby arrived, the governors of Georgia and South Carolina proclaimed a state of emergency.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic contender in the US election, postponed events in North Carolina and Georgia this week due to the hurricane, according to local media sources citing her campaign team.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Border Patrol reported that Debby had washed ashore 25 bags of cocaine worth around $1 million off the coast of the Florida Keys, where they were captured.\n\nIn July, at least 18 people were murdered when Hurricane Beryl ripped through the Caribbean before hitting the southern US states of Texas and Louisiana.\n\nScientists believe climate change contributes to the rapid strengthening of storms like Beryl because warmer oceans have more energy for them to feed on.", "source": {"uri": "howafrica.com", "dataType": "news",

It was one of the cities hardest hit by flooding on Monday.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said in a social media update.\n\nJust north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"We are facing an unprecedented weather event with Hurricane Debby,\" said Jodie Fiske, public safety director for Manatee County. \"The safety of our residents is our top priority, and we are doing everything in our power to respond effectively to this crisis.\"\n\nA flash flood emergency was issued into Monday evening for the Lake City area in the north central part of the state, where up to a foot (30.5 centimeters) of rain had fallen and more was expected.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that the state could continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" he said during an afternoon briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nDebby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It since has weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, covering roads with water and contributing to at least five deaths.\n\nA truck driver died on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nAnd in Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night. The Florida Highway Patrol said a 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries.\n\nIn southern Georgia, a 19-year-old man died Monday afternoon when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n\nNearly 200,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nAirports were also affected. More than 1,600 flights had been canceled nationwide, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.\n\nThe potential for high water also threatened Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nLocal leaders in Savannah said flooding could happen in areas that don't usually get high water if Debby stalls out over the city. With winds and rainfall expected to worsen overnight, authorities issued a curfew from 10 p.m. Monday until 6 a.m. Tuesday.\n\n\"This type of rain hovering over us, coming with the intensity that they tell us it is coming, it's going to catch a whole lot of people by surprise,\" said Chatham County Chairman Chester Ellis.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.\n\nThe city of Charleston has an emergency plan in place that includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding. Officials announced a curfew for the city starting at 11 p.m. as some of the heaviest rain is expected to fall overnight.\n\nNorth Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed Monday. Several areas along the state's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said. Biden approved a request from South Carolina's governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he has asked Biden to issue a preemptive federal emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to the state.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has postponed a campaign stop scheduled for Thursday in Savannah, Georgia.\n\nDebby made landfall near Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida of less than 1,000 residents. It's not far from where Hurricane Idalia made landfall less than a year ago as a Category 3 storm.\n\nSue Chewning lives in nearby Cross City and has weathered both storms. In her nearly 73 years of living in the area, she said she doesn't recall any direct hits from a hurricane - until this one-two punch from Idalia and Debby.\n\n\"Some people may say, 'I can't take this anymore'. But I think for the most part ... it's a close-knit community and most of the local people, they're going to stay, dig down, help each other,\" Chewning said.", "source": {"uri":

Savannah Mayor Van Johnson told residents to expect a rough day Tuesday. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, which is based on wind speeds, meteorologists say it's the storm's rainfall capacity that makes it extremely dangerous.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nDebby still getting energy from ocean water, expert says\n\nDebby has weakened over land because tropical cyclones derive their energy from warm water, but part of the circulation was still interacting Tuesday with water over the Atlantic, said Richard Pasch, a senior hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe storm's center is expected to move out over the water off the Georgia and South Carolina coast, then move back inland, so it could restrengthen, but it's not clear how much, he said.\n\nTropical storm warnings were posted from northeastern Florida up into North Carolina, and very heavy rain is expected, leading to catastrophic flooding across parts of southeastern Georgia, the eastern half of South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina through Friday, he said.\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" he said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nCharleston ready with sandbags, parking garages\n\nDebby's center was over southeastern Georgia early Tuesday with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (75 kph), and it was moving northeast near 7 mph (11 kph). The center is expected to move off Georgia's coast later Tuesday. Some strengthening is forecast on Wednesday and Thursday as Debby drifts offshore, before it moves inland over South Carolina on Thursday.\n\nThe emergency plan in the city of Charleston, South Carolina, includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters, and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed by flooding.\n\nHundreds rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, area, officials say\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said Monday in a social media post.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said in a social media update.\n\nJust north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"We are facing an unprecedented weather event with Hurricane Debby,\" said Jodie Fiske, Manatee County's public safety director. \"The safety of our residents is our top priority, and we are doing everything in our power to respond effectively to this crisis.\"\n\nMan killed when storm topples large tree onto home in south Georgia, officials say\n\nHeavy winds and rain associated with Debby toppled a large tree onto a porch at a home in south Georgia, killing a 19-year-old man, authorities said Monday.\n\nColquitt County Coroner C. Verlyn Brock said the man died at the home in the city of Moultrie, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Valdosta, Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.\n\nThe storm has damaged roofs and downed power lines in Moultrie, Police Chief Chad Castleberry told WALB-TV.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Debby had top winds near 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening as it moved slowly to the northeast.

(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel via AP)ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nNorthern Florida, the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina and parts of North Carolina are bracing for severe rain and catastrophic flooding this week as the Debby storm system moves up and east.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on the Big Bend coast of Florida early Monday, first hitting the small community of Steinhatchee. It damaged homes and businesses, sent floodwaters rising, caused sweeping power outages across the state and Georgia and led to several fatalities. Debby was downgraded to a tropical storm midday Monday.\n\nBut experts say the worst is yet to come as the storm system is expected to stall over the Southeast region.\n\nHow much rain is expected?\n\nForecasters say the system could pummel the Southeast with widespread areas of up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain and some totaling up to 30 inches (76 centimeters).\n\nThat would be a record-setting rainfall, shattering the record from a tropical system in 2018's Hurricane Florence. More than 23 inches (58 centimeters) of rain was recorded in South Carolina after that storm hit the Carolinas.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, \"It really is worthy of a Category 3 or 4 rating, if you want to talk about rainfall impacts,\" said Jeff Masters, founder of Weather Underground, now with Yale Climate Connections. \"That's going to cause a lot of damage.\"\n\nWhat areas are at risk?\n\nNorthern Florida as well as low-lying areas including Savannah, Georgia, and Hilton Head Island and Charleston, South Carolina, are expected to see the most severe flooding. North Carolina could also be impacted.\n\nOfficials in Savannah warned the area could see a month's worth of rain in four days if the system stalls. There were also flooding concerns for Tybee Island, Georgia's largest public beach 18 miles (28.97 kilometers) east of Savannah. On top of any torrential downpours that Debby dishes out, the island could get even wetter from 2 to 4 feet of storm surge, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Hilton Head Island Mayor Alan Perry said on a video posted to Facebook. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.\n\nFew places in South Carolina are as susceptible to flooding as Charleston. Much of the city and surrounding areas founded in 1670 were built on land created by using fill dirt and other debris. Rising sea levels cause a number of minor flooding events even without a storm and like many coastal cities, Charleston can't drain well.\n\nThe city doesn't expect a massive amount of flooding from the ocean, but the storm is still dangerous. Heavy rain can back up into the city, also causing flooding.\n\nWhat's causing this storm to stall?\n\nSome hurricanes make landfall and move quickly, experts say, while others slow substantially.\n\n\"Really what happened, and why the storm has stalled, is because there's basically high pressure areas to the west of the storm and to the northeast, and that's kind of pinned the storm,\" said Phil Klotzbach, senior research scientist at Colorado State University's Department of Atmospheric Science. \"With a hurricane you always have wind problems, but when you have a storm moving at 3 to 5 miles an hour, it's going to be over any specific location for a very long period of time, so flash flooding and just tremendous rainfall totals are going to be very likely.\"\n\nExperts say the warming atmosphere plays a role in the severity of storm surges such as Debby.\n\nWarming water in the northeast Gulf of Mexico is increasing Hurricane Debby's heavy rains, as more moisture evaporates from the waters, Masters said. Some research says climate change can impact the forward motion of hurricanes, he added, making them go slower.\n\n\"It's something we've been seeing more of lately,\" Masters said.\n\nHow long could this last?\n\nThe worst of the rain is expected during the first half of the week, but it could last through Saturday, forecasters said.\n\n___\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit.

Savannah Mayor Van Johnson told residents to expect a rough day Tuesday. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, which is based on wind speeds, meteorologists say it's the storm's rainfall capacity that makes it extremely dangerous.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nDebby still getting energy from ocean water, expert says\n\nDebby has weakened over land because tropical cyclones derive their energy from warm water, but part of the circulation was still interacting Tuesday with water over the Atlantic, said Richard Pasch, a senior hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe storm's center is expected to move out over the water off the Georgia and South Carolina coast, then move back inland, so it could restrengthen, but it's not clear how much, he said.\n\nTropical storm warnings were posted from northeastern Florida up into North Carolina, and very heavy rain is expected, leading to catastrophic flooding across parts of southeastern Georgia, the eastern half of South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina through Friday, he said.\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" he said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nCharleston ready with sandbags, parking garages\n\nDebby's center was over southeastern Georgia early Tuesday with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (75 kph), and it was moving northeast near 7 mph (11 kph). The center is expected to move off Georgia's coast later Tuesday. Some strengthening is forecast on Wednesday and Thursday as Debby drifts offshore, before it moves inland over South Carolina on Thursday.\n\nThe emergency plan in the city of Charleston, South Carolina, includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters, and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed by flooding.\n\nHundreds rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, area, officials say\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said Monday in a social media post.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said in a social media update.\n\nJust north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"We are facing an unprecedented weather event with Hurricane Debby,\" said Jodie Fiske, Manatee County's public safety director. \"The safety of our residents is our top priority, and we are doing everything in our power to respond effectively to this crisis.\"\n\nMan killed when storm topples large tree onto home in south Georgia, officials say\n\nHeavy winds and rain associated with Debby toppled a large tree onto a porch at a home in south Georgia, killing a 19-year-old man, authorities said Monday.\n\nColquitt County Coroner C. Verlyn Brock said the man died at the home in the city of Moultrie, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Valdosta, Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.\n\nThe storm has damaged roofs and downed power lines in Moultrie, Police Chief Chad Castleberry told WALB-TV.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Debby had top winds near 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening as it moved slowly to the northeast.

Here's how much rain could fall", "body": "Northern Florida, the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina and parts of North Carolina are bracing for severe rain and catastrophic flooding this week as the Debby storm system moves up and east.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on the Big Bend coast of Florida early Monday, first hitting the small community of Steinhatchee. It damaged homes and businesses, sent floodwaters rising, caused sweeping power outages across the state and Georgia and led to several fatalities. Debby was downgraded to a tropical storm midday Monday.\n\nBut experts say the worst is yet to come as the storm system is expected to stall over the Southeast region.\n\nHow much rain is expected?\n\nForecasters say the system could pummel the Southeast with widespread areas of up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain and some totaling up to 30 inches (76 centimeters).\n\nThat would be a record-setting rainfall, shattering the record from a tropical system in 2018's Hurricane Florence. More than 23 inches (58 centimeters) of rain was recorded in South Carolina after that storm hit the Carolinas.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, \"It really is worthy of a Category 3 or 4 rating, if you want to talk about rainfall impacts,\" said Jeff Masters, founder of Weather Underground, now with Yale Climate Connections. \"That's going to cause a lot of damage.\"\n\nWhat areas are at risk?\n\nNorthern Florida as well as low-lying areas including Savannah, Georgia, and Hilton Head Island and Charleston, South Carolina, are expected to see the most severe flooding. North Carolina could also be impacted.\n\nOfficials in Savannah warned the area could see a month's worth of rain in four days if the system stalls. There were also flooding concerns for Tybee Island, Georgia's largest public beach 18 miles (28.97 kilometers) east of Savannah. On top of any torrential downpours that Debby dishes out, the island could get even wetter from 2 to 4 feet of storm surge, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Hilton Head Island Mayor Alan Perry said on a video posted to Facebook. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.\n\nFew places in South Carolina are as susceptible to flooding as Charleston. Much of the city and surrounding areas founded in 1670 were built on land created by using fill dirt and other debris. Rising sea levels cause a number of minor flooding events even without a storm and like many coastal cities, Charleston can't drain well.\n\nThe city doesn't expect a massive amount of flooding from the ocean, but the storm is still dangerous.

A 19-year-old man was killed near Valdosta, Georgia, when a tree fell onto a porch, police said.\n\nALSO READ: 'Life-threatening' Tropical Storm Debby takes aim at Florida's Gulf Coast\n\nOthers killed in the storm included a truck driver who lost control of an 18-wheeler on Interstate 75 and went into the Tampa Bypass Canal, and a 38-year-old woman and her 12-year-old son whose SUV crashed in Dixie County north of Tampa in stormy weather, according to law enforcement.\n\nRoughly 150,000 customers were without power on Monday night in Florida, down from a peak of 350,000, according to Poweroutage.us, and flight trackers showed hundreds of flights originating from and heading to Florida airports were canceled on Monday.\n\nVice-President Kamala Harris postponed a campaign stop scheduled this week in Savannah, Georgia, the Savannah Morning News reported.\n\nMore than 500 people were rescued from flood waters from homes and vehicles in Sarasota, Florida, on Monday, police said, and about 180 people were rescued in Manatee County, officials said.\n\nThe hurricane center said Debby would cross Georgia and move offshore into the Atlantic Ocean by Tuesday night, then re-strengthen and make a second landfall, probably in South Carolina near Charleston.\n\nThe storm was near the Florida-Georgia border late on Monday, about 35 miles (60 km) west of Brunswick, Georgia, and crawling at 7 mph (11 kph) northeast with sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph) and higher gusts, the hurricane center said.\n\nThe center forecast \"catastrophic flooding,\" with some areas along the Atlantic coast receiving 20 to 30 inches (76 cm) of rain by Friday morning. The governors of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina declared states of emergency in anticipation of Debby's damage.\n\nBy late afternoon on Monday, Debby had already dumped eight to 16 inches of rain in some parts of central Florida, according to local weather reports.\n\nALSO READ: Climate catastrophes drive increase in premiums in US home insurance rates\n\n\"This is going to be an event that is going to be probably here for the next five to seven days, maybe as long as 10 days, depending on how much rainfall we get,\" said Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management.\n\nOfficials in Georgia and South Carolina braced for flooding.\n\n\"It may be the most water we've seen in a long while,\" South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said at a briefing. \"There may be flooding in areas that never flooded in the past.\"\n\nSavannah Mayor Van Johnson said the city could expect a \"once in a thousand year\" rain event.\n\n\"This will literally create islands in the city,\" Johnson said.\n\nA slow-moving tropical storm as it passed over Cuba, Debby gained strength from exceptionally warm Gulf waters as it paralleled Florida's Gulf Coast on Sunday.\n\nDebby bears some of the hallmarks of Hurricane Harvey, which hit Corpus Christi, Texas, in August 2017. Downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved inland, Harvey lingered over Texas, dumping about 50 inches of rain on Houston and causing $125 billion in damage.\n\nClimate scientists believe man-made global warming from burning fossil fuels has raised the temperature of the oceans, making storms bigger and more devastating.\n\nThe last hurricane to make a direct hit on the Big Bend region was Hurricane Idalia, which briefly gained Category 4 strength before making landfall as a Category 3 in August 2023, with winds of more than 125 mph. The National Centers for Environmental Information estimated $3.5 billion in damages. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis described the initial effects of Debby as \"modest\" compared with Idalia.\n\nForecasters expect numerous Atlantic hurricanes in the 2024 season, which began on June 1, including four to seven major ones. That would exceed the record-breaking 2005 season that spawned the devastating Katrina and Rita hurricanes.\n\nOnly one other hurricane, Beryl, has formed in the Atlantic this year. The earliest Category 5 storm on record, it struck the Caribbean and Mexico's Yucatan peninsula before rolling up the Gulf Coast of Texas as a Category 1 storm, with sustained winds up to 95 mph.",

At least four deaths were reported in the state, and hundreds had to be rescued from flooded homes.\n\nThe storm is now threatening to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nHundreds rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, area, officials say\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said Monday in a social media post.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said in a social media update.\n\nJust north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"We are facing an unprecedented weather event with Hurricane Debby,\" said Jodie Fiske, Manatee County's public safety director. \"The safety of our residents is our top priority, and we are doing everything in our power to respond effectively to this crisis.\"\n\nMan killed when storm topples large tree onto home in south Georgia, officials say\n\nHeavy winds and rain associated with Debby toppled a large tree onto a porch at a home in south Georgia, killing a 19-year-old man, authorities said Monday.\n\nColquitt County Coroner C. Verlyn Brock said the man died at the home in the city of Moultrie, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Valdosta, Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.\n\nThe storm has damaged roofs and downed power lines in Moultrie, Police Chief Chad Castleberry told WALB-TV.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Debby had top winds near 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening as it moved slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns eastward.\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, announces curfew, roads into historic city to be closed\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, officials announced a curfew starting at 11 p.m. Monday for the peninsula that makes up much of downtown and the older parts of the 350-year-old city as some of the heaviest rain from Tropical Storm Debby is expected to fall overnight.\n\nPolice will barricade all eight roads leading into the peninsula and only let essential workers and emergency personnel in or out. High-water vehicles will also be staged to go into the area as needed, Charleston Mayor William Cogswell said at a Monday evening news conference.\n\n\"We need people to make their way out. This is not something you can stay at the bar until 10:45. We need you to take this seriously,\" Cogswell said.\n\nThe mayor said forecasters told him 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain could fall in Charleston overnight.\n\nCity officials will assess the situation early Tuesday and decide how and when to reopen roads and lift the curfew.\n\nNo evacuations planned for now in South Carolina, officials say\n\nState officials don't plan any evacuations in South Carolina for now as Tropical Storm Debby slowly spins toward the state.\n\nLarge-scale evacuations typically bring people inland from the coast, and forecasters say Debby's biggest impacts could be as much as 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain in localized areas throughout the state, causing floodwaters to rise quickly in small areas. So any evacuations will up to local leaders.\n\n\"This storm may not have the high winds of a hurricane, but it has the potential to cause life-threatening floods across the state. And I would like to emphasize that Tropical Storm Debby is not just a coastal event, but it is a statewide event,\" state Emergency Management Division Director Kim Stenson said at a Monday afternoon news conference.\n\nBiden approves request from South Carolina's governor for emergency declaration\n\nThe White House said Monday that President Joe Biden has approved a request from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said personnel from the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard are deploying to the region and are prepared to support recovery efforts.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday ahead of Debby's anticipated rainfall. Flooding and power outages are expected to start Tuesday and continue through the rest of the week, according to North Carolina Emergency Management officials.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis previously had declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida's 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also had made his own emergency declaration.\n\nCurfew announced for Savannah and surrounding county as Debby approaches\n\nWith Debby's winds and rains expected to worsen overnight, officials for Savannah and surrounding Chatham County announced that an overnight curfew will take effect at 10 p.m. Monday and run to 6 a.m. Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nFlorida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.\n\nNo deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nMayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island: Don't let your guard down\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nIn saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nPackages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nDebby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nBiden briefed on Debby's progress\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nBig worry is storm surge from Debby\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nHundreds of thousands without power\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\n-- -\n\nThis version corrects the attribution for power outage figures to PowerOutage.us, not PowerOutage.com.", "source": {"uri":

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby moved menacingly into some of America's most historic Southern cities and was expected to bring prolonged downpours and flooding throughout the day Tuesday after slamming into Florida and prompting the rescue of hundreds from flooded homes.\n\nRecord-setting rain from the storm that killed at least five people on Monday was causing flash flooding, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) possible in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\n\"Hunker down,\" Van Johnson, the mayor of Savannah, Georgia, told residents in a social media livestream Monday night. \"Expect that it will be a rough day\" on Tuesday, he said.\n\nFlash flood warnings were issued in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Both Savannah and Charleston announced curfews Monday night into Tuesday.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday.\n\nIn addition to the curfew, the city of Charleston's emergency plan includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding.\n\nIn Edisto Beach, South Carolina, a tornado touched down Monday night, damaging trees, homes and taking down power lines, the Colleton County Sheriff's Office said on social media. No injuries were immediately reported, officials said.\n\nThe National Weather Service continued issuing tornado warnings well into Monday night for parts of the state including in the island town of Hilton Head.\n\nDebby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It has weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, drenching and bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across portions of eastern Georgia, the coastal plain of South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Wednesday.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said in a social media post. Just north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said on social media.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that the state could continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" he said. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nFive people had died due to the storm as of Monday night, including a truck driver on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office. In Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night.\n\nIn southern Georgia, a 19-year-old man died Monday afternoon when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n\nNearly 160,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday night, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were also canceled nationwide on Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved a request from South Carolina's governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he has asked Biden to issue a preemptive federal emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to the state.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris postponed a campaign stop scheduled for Thursday in Savannah.\n\nNorth Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed Monday. Several areas along the state's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.\n\nMartin reported from Atlanta. AP journalists Freida Frisaro in Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Kate Payne in Tallahassee, Florida; Michael Schneider in Orlando, Florida; Russ Bynum in Savannah, Georgia; Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina; Darlene Superville and Will Weissert in Washington, and Lisa Baumann in Bellingham, Washington, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Savannah Mayor Van Johnson told residents to expect a rough day Tuesday. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, which is based on wind speeds, meteorologists say it's the storm's rainfall capacity that makes it extremely dangerous.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nDebby has weakened over land because tropical cyclones derive their energy from warm water, but part of the circulation was still interacting Tuesday with water over the Atlantic, said Richard Pasch, a senior hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe storm's center is expected to move out over the water off the Georgia and South Carolina coast, then move back inland, so it could restrengthen, but it's not clear how much, he said.\n\nTropical storm warnings were posted from northeastern Florida up into North Carolina, and very heavy rain is expected, leading to catastrophic flooding across parts of southeastern Georgia, the eastern half of South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina through Friday, he said.\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" he said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nDebby's center was over southeastern Georgia early Tuesday with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (75 kph), and it was moving northeast near 7 mph (11 kph). The center is expected to move off Georgia's coast later Tuesday. Some strengthening is forecast on Wednesday and Thursday as Debby drifts offshore, before it moves inland over South Carolina on Thursday.\n\nThe emergency plan in the city of Charleston, South Carolina, includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters, and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed by flooding.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said Monday in a social media post.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said in a social media update.\n\nJust north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"We are facing an unprecedented weather event with Hurricane Debby,\" said Jodie Fiske, Manatee County's public safety director. \"The safety of our residents is our top priority, and we are doing everything in our power to respond effectively to this crisis.\"\n\nHeavy winds and rain associated with Debby toppled a large tree onto a porch at a home in south Georgia, killing a 19-year-old man, authorities said Monday.\n\nColquitt County Coroner C. Verlyn Brock said the man died at the home in the city of Moultrie, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Valdosta, Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.\n\nThe storm has damaged roofs and downed power lines in Moultrie, Police Chief Chad Castleberry told WALB-TV.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Debby had top winds near 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening as it moved slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns eastward.", "source": {"uri": "ctpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTPost"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It formed over the ocean and made landfall, causing significant damage and disruptions.\n\nBy Monday evening, the NHC said the storm was registering maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph) as it swept into Georgia.\n\nStorm surge warnings, signalling a life-threatening inundation from rising water, are in effect in parts of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.\n\nDebby was expected to bring \"potentially historic rainfall\" of up to 30 inches as it moved north, the NHC said.\n\nBut it said the storm was weakening after making landfall earlier with sustained speeds of 80 mph (130 kph) as a Category One hurricane -- the lowest on a scale of five.\n\nMandatory evacuations were ordered for part of Citrus County, Florida, with several other counties under voluntary evacuation orders, local media reported.\n\nThe governors of Georgia and South Carolina declared a state of emergency ahead of Debby's arrival.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris - the Democratic candidate in the US election - postponed events in North Carolina and Georgia this week due to the storm, according to local media reports citing her campaign team.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Border Patrol announced that Debby had washed up 25 packages of cocaine worth around $1 million to the coast of the Florida Keys, where they were seized.\n\nIn July, at least 18 people were killed when the powerful Hurricane Beryl tore through the Caribbean before hitting the southern US states of Texas and Louisiana.\n\nScientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of storms such as Beryl because there is more energy in a warmer ocean for them to feed on.", "source": {"uri": "punchng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Punch Newspapers"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(WBTV) - Record rainfall is possible this week in the Southeast U.S. -- and could lead to catastrophic flooding -- as Tropical Storm Debby moves through the region.\n\nThe tropical storm touched down in Florida on Monday, Aug. 5 as a Category 1 hurricane, and is expected to slowly move up the eastern U.S. coast through the week. Rainfall will most significantly impact coastal areas in South Carolina and Georgia, though rain will be far more widespread amid the storm.\n\nHere's a look at what to expect.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center predicts that rain from Tropical Storm Debby will be heaviest along the South Carolina coast from Charleston to Savannah, Georgia. Areas between Charleston and Savannah could see 20-30 inches of rain by Saturday, Aug. 10.\n\nSouth Carolina communities west and north of the coast are also expected to receive a significant amount of rain in the coming days. Communities just outside Charleston could see 16-20 inches of rain, while those near the center of the state could see anywhere from 8-16 inches of rain.\n\n\"Across portions of southeast Georgia, the coastal plain of South Carolina, and southeast North Carolina, 10 to 20 inches of rainfall, with local amounts to 30 inches, are expected through Saturday morning. This potentially historic rainfall will likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding,\" according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nAccording to Kim Stenson, director of the South Carolina Emergency Management Division, the anticipated rainfall would set new records for the state. The many inches of rain could lead to flooding and flash flooding in the state.\n\n\"The heavy rains and flooding currently predicted this week are historic in scope and scale. Our experts with the National Hurricane Center believe flooding to be catastrophic for many parts of South Carolina,\" Stenson said in a statement Monday. \"Take no chances with this storm.\"\n\n---> Tropical Storm Debby may bring 'catastrophic' flooding to South Carolina amid 'multiday deluge'\n\nParts of western South Carolina should see less rain than the coast. About 1-4 inches of rain are possible for those furthest west, while the western-central portion of the state could receive 4-12 inches.\n\nCommunities along the southern North Carolina coast, including Wilmington, could receive as much as 12-16 inches of rain by Saturday.

Verlyn Brock said the man died at the home in the city of Moultrie, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Valdosta, Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.\n\nThe storm has damaged roofs and downed power lines in Moultrie, Police Chief Chad Castleberry told WALB-TV.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Debby had top winds near 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening as it moved slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns eastward.\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, announces curfew, roads into historic city to be closed\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, officials announced a curfew starting at 11 p.m. Monday for the peninsula that makes up much of downtown and the older parts of the 350-year-old city as some of the heaviest rain from Tropical Storm Debby is expected to fall overnight.\n\nPolice will barricade all eight roads leading into the peninsula and only let essential workers and emergency personnel in or out. High-water vehicles will also be staged to go into the area as needed, Charleston Mayor William Cogswell said at a Monday evening news conference.\n\n\"We need people to make their way out. This is not something you can stay at the bar until 10:45. We need you to take this seriously,\" Cogswell said.\n\nThe mayor said forecasters told him 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain could fall in Charleston overnight.\n\nCity officials will assess the situation early Tuesday and decide how and when to reopen roads and lift the curfew.\n\nNo evacuations planned for now in South Carolina, officials say\n\nState officials don't plan any evacuations in South Carolina for now as Tropical Storm Debby slowly spins toward the state.\n\nLarge-scale evacuations typically bring people inland from the coast, and forecasters say Debby's biggest impacts could be as much as 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain in localized areas throughout the state, causing floodwaters to rise quickly in small areas. So any evacuations will up to local leaders.\n\n\"This storm may not have the high winds of a hurricane, but it has the potential to cause life-threatening floods across the state. And I would like to emphasize that Tropical Storm Debby is not just a coastal event, but it is a statewide event,\" state Emergency Management Division Director Kim Stenson said at a Monday afternoon news conference.\n\nBiden approves request from South Carolina's governor for emergency declaration\n\nThe White House said Monday that President Joe Biden has approved a request from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said personnel from the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard are deploying to the region and are prepared to support recovery efforts.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday ahead of Debby's anticipated rainfall. Flooding and power outages are expected to start Tuesday and continue through the rest of the week, according to North Carolina Emergency Management officials.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis previously had declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida's 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also had made his own emergency declaration.\n\nCurfew announced for Savannah and surrounding county as Debby approaches\n\nWith Debby's winds and rains expected to worsen overnight, officials for Savannah and surrounding Chatham County announced that an overnight curfew will take effect at 10 p.m. Monday and run to 6 a.m. Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nFlorida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.\n\nNo deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nMayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island: Don't let your guard down\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nIn saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nPackages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nDebby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nBiden briefed on Debby's progress\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nBig worry is storm surge from Debby\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nHundreds of thousands without power\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\n-- -\n\nThis version corrects the attribution for power outage figures to PowerOutage.us, not PowerOutage.com.\n\nMore from this

Both Savannah and Charleston announced curfews Monday night into Tuesday.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday.\n\nIn addition to the curfew, the city of Charleston's emergency plan includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding.\n\nIn Edisto Beach, South Carolina, a tornado touched down Monday night, damaging trees, homes and taking down power lines, the Colleton County Sheriff's Office said on social media. No injuries were immediately reported, officials said.\n\nThe National Weather Service continued issuing tornado warnings well into Monday night for parts of the state including in the island town of Hilton Head.\n\nDebby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It has weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, drenching and bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across portions of eastern Georgia, the coastal plain of South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Wednesday.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said in a social media post. Just north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said on social media.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that the state could continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" he said. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nFive people had died due to the storm as of Monday night, including a truck driver on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office. In Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night.\n\nIn southern Georgia, a 19-year-old man died Monday afternoon when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n\nNearly 160,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday night, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were also canceled nationwide on Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved a request from South Carolina's governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he has asked Biden to issue a preemptive federal emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to the state.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris postponed a campaign stop scheduled for Thursday in Savannah.\n\nNorth Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed Monday. Several areas along the state's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.\n\n___\n\nMartin reported from Atlanta.

flooded  --  warning of 'once in a thousand year' rain event", "body": "The storm is moving north towards the state of Georgia, which is bracing for more flooding as the White House signalled a national recovery effort was mobilising.\n\nEven after being downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm, the weather system nicknamed Debby has slammed the southern US with torrential rain, high winds and ongoing flooding.\n\nAt least six people have died in weather-related accidents as hundreds have been rescued from flooded towns in northern Florida.\n\nLocal authorities said they had been inundated with twice the amount of rain initially predicted.\n\nThe storm was near the Florida-Georgia border by early evening Monday local time, with winds of 80 kilometres per hour.\n\nDebby was initially classified as a tropical storm when it formed in the Atlantic Ocean in early August.\n\nIt passed by the northern coast of Cuba before being upgraded to a hurricane on August 5.\n\nThe hurricane then made landfall early on Monday local time as a category one storm, a classification meaning winds of up to 153kph are expected.\n\nSome of the US' most historic Southern cities are threatened with flooding as the weather system moves inland.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, officials announced a curfew starting at 11pm on Monday for the peninsula as some of the heaviest rain from Tropical Storm Debby is expected to fall overnight.\n\n\"It may be the most water we've seen in a long while,\" South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said at a briefing.\n\nSavannah Mayor Van Johnson said the city could expect a \"once in a thousand year\" rain event.\n\n\"This will literally create islands in the city,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\nRecord-setting rain was expected to cause flash flooding, with up to 76 centimetres possible in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nSarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, was one of the hardest hit by flooding.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" said Sarasota County fire chief David Rathbun in a social media update.\n\n\"This type of rain hovering over us, coming with the intensity that they tell us it is coming, it's going to catch a whole lot of people by surprise,\" said Chatham County chairman Chester Ellis.\n\nFlorida's governor Ron DeSantis warned that just because the storm was moving north into Georgia, it didn't mean the state wouldn't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" he said during an afternoon briefing at the state's emergency operations centre.\n\n\"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nFalling trees in Florida have killed at least two people, with three others dead in car crashes in wet and dangerous conditions.\n\nRoughly 240,000 customers were without power in Florida, according to Poweroutage.us, and flight trackers showed hundreds of flights originating from and heading to Florida airports were cancelled on Monday.\n\nNorth Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Governor Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed Monday.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nThe hurricane centre said Debby would cross Georgia and move offshore into the Atlantic Ocean by Tuesday night, then re-strengthen and make a second landfall, probably in South Carolina near Charleston.\n\nUS President Joe Biden approved emergency declarations across Florida and South Carolina, with the White House saying defence personnel, the coast guard and others are deploying to affected areas to support recovery efforts.\n\nDebby made landfall near Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nIt's not far from where Hurricane Idalia made landfall less than a year ago as a category three storm.\n\nSue Chewning lives in Steinhatchee and weathered both storms.\n\nIn her nearly 73 years of living in the area, she said she doesn't recall any direct hits from a hurricane -- until this one-two punch from Idalia and Debby.\n\n\"But I think for the most part ... it's a close-knit community and most of the local people, they're going to stay, dig down, help each other.\"", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type":

flooding'", "body": "Four killed by Storm Debby as south-eastern states face 'catastrophic flooding'\n\nOur Foreign Staff\n\n6 August 2024 at 10:12 am\n\nTropical Storm Debby drenched Florida on Monday, killing at least four people and threatening south-eastern US states with heavy rainfall and catastrophic flooding.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died when a tree was blown onto a mobile home in Levy County, the sheriff's office said, after Debby made landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast early Monday as a category one hurricane.\n\nAuthorities said a truck driver was killed after his 18-wheeler plunged into a canal in Hillsborough County, while a 38-year-old woman and 12-year-old boy died in a car crash in Dixie County.\n\nThe storm moved into Georgia overnight on Monday and is expected to go offshore before approaching the South Carolina coast on Thursday, according to the National Hurricane Centre (NHC).\n\n\"This is a level four out of four risk for excessive rainfall,\" Michael Brennan, director of the NHC, told reporters.\n\n\"This is going to result in a prolonged extreme rainfall event with potential for catastrophic flooding across coastal portions of Georgia, South Carolina, even extending up into North Carolina,\" he added.\n\nRon DeSantis, the Florida governor, said that some 250,000 residents in his state were without power.\n\n\"Please, be very cautious when you're going out,\" he said, adding that Debby's winds had not been as damaging as previous hurricanes that have hit Florida.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has approved emergency declarations for Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, allowing for federal assistance in coordinating disaster relief efforts.\n\nMr DeSantis also activated his state's national guard, with more than 3,000 service members mobilised to help with the storm response.\n\nBy Monday evening, the NHC said the storm was registering maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph) as it swept into Georgia.\n\nStorm surge warnings - signalling a life-threatening inundation from rising water - are in effect in parts of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.\n\nDebby was expected to bring \"potentially historic rainfall\" of up to 30 inches as it moved north, the NHC said.\n\nBut it said the storm was weakening after making landfall earlier with sustained speeds of 80 mph (130 kph) as a category one hurricane - the lowest on a scale of five.\n\nMandatory evacuations were ordered for parts of Citrus County, Florida, with several other counties under voluntary evacuation orders, local media reported.\n\nThe governors of Georgia and South Carolina declared a state of emergency ahead of Debby's arrival.\n\nKamala Harris - the vice president and the Democratic candidate in the US election - postponed events in North Carolina and Georgia this week due to the storm, according to local media reports citing her campaign team.\n\nMeanwhile, the US border patrol announced that Debby had washed up 25 packages of cocaine worth around $1 million (\u00a3784,000) to the coast of the Florida Keys, where they were seized.\n\nIn July, at least 18 people were killed when the powerful Hurricane Beryl tore through the Caribbean before hitting the southern US states of Texas and Louisiana.\n\nScientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of storms such as Beryl because there is more energy in a warmer ocean for them to feed on.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Verlyn Brock said the man died at the home in the city of Moultrie, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Valdosta, Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.\n\nThe storm has damaged roofs and downed power lines in Moultrie, Police Chief Chad Castleberry told WALB-TV.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Debby had top winds near 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening as it moved slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns eastward.\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, officials announced a curfew starting at 11 p.m. Monday for the peninsula that makes up much of downtown and the older parts of the 350-year-old city as some of the heaviest rain from Tropical Storm Debby is expected to fall overnight.\n\nPolice will barricade all eight roads leading into the peninsula and only let essential workers and emergency personnel in or out. High-water vehicles will also be staged to go into the area as needed, Charleston Mayor William Cogswell said at a Monday evening news conference.\n\n\"We need people to make their way out. This is not something you can stay at the bar until 10:45. We need you to take this seriously,\" Cogswell said.\n\nThe mayor said forecasters told him 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain could fall in Charleston overnight.\n\nCity officials will assess the situation early Tuesday and decide how and when to reopen roads and lift the curfew.\n\nState officials don't plan any evacuations in South Carolina for now as Tropical Storm Debby slowly spins toward the state.\n\nLarge-scale evacuations typically bring people inland from the coast, and forecasters say Debby's biggest impacts could be as much as 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain in localized areas throughout the state, causing floodwaters to rise quickly in small areas. So any evacuations will up to local leaders.\n\n\"This storm may not have the high winds of a hurricane, but it has the potential to cause life-threatening floods across the state. And I would like to emphasize that Tropical Storm Debby is not just a coastal event, but it is a statewide event,\" state Emergency Management Division Director Kim Stenson said at a Monday afternoon news conference.\n\nThe White House said Monday that President Joe Biden has approved a request from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said personnel from the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard are deploying to the region and are prepared to support recovery efforts.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday ahead of Debby's anticipated rainfall. Flooding and power outages are expected to start Tuesday and continue through the rest of the week, according to North Carolina Emergency Management officials.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis previously had declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida's 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also had made his own emergency declaration.\n\nWith Debby's winds and rains expected to worsen overnight, officials for Savannah and surrounding Chatham County announced that an overnight curfew will take effect at 10 p.m. Monday and run to 6 a.m. Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\n-- -\n\nThis version corrects the attribution for power outage figures to PowerOutage.us, not PowerOutage.com.", "source": {"uri":

Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said personnel from the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard are deploying to the region and are prepared to support recovery efforts.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday ahead of Debby's anticipated rainfall. Flooding and power outages are expected to start Tuesday and continue through the rest of the week, according to North Carolina Emergency Management officials.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis previously had declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida's 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also had made his own emergency declaration.\n\nCurfew announced for Savannah and surrounding county as Debby approaches\n\nWith Debby's winds and rains expected to worsen overnight, officials for Savannah and surrounding Chatham County announced that an overnight curfew will take effect at 10 p.m. Monday and run to 6 a.m. Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nFlorida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.\n\nNo deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nMayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island: Don't let your guard down\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nIn saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nPackages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nDebby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nBiden briefed on Debby's progress\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 50 mph (85 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was near the Florida-Georgia border and was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to decrease in speed as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nBig worry is storm surge from Debby\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nHundreds of thousands without power\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\n-- -\n\nThis version corrects the attribution for power outage figures to PowerOutage.us, not PowerOutage.com.", "source": {"uri":

A 19-year-old man was killed near Valdosta, Georgia, when a tree fell onto a porch, police said.\n\nOthers killed in the storm included a truck driver who lost control of an 18-wheeler on Interstate 75 and went into the Tampa Bypass Canal, and a 38-year-old woman and her 12-year-old son whose SUV crashed in Dixie County north of Tampa in stormy weather, according to law enforcement.\n\nRoughly 150,000 customers were without power on Monday night in Florida, down from a peak of 350,000, according to Poweroutage.us, and flight trackers showed hundreds of flights originating from and heading to Florida airports were canceled on Monday.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris postponed a campaign stop scheduled this week in Savannah, Georgia, the Savannah Morning News reported.\n\nMore than 500 people were rescued from flood waters from homes and vehicles in Sarasota, Florida, on Monday, police said, and about 180 people were rescued in Manatee County, officials said.\n\nThe hurricane center said Debby would cross Georgia and move offshore into the Atlantic Ocean by Tuesday night, then re-strengthen and make a second landfall, probably in South Carolina near Charleston.\n\nThe storm was near the Florida-Georgia border late on Monday, about 35 miles (60 km) west of Brunswick, Georgia, and crawling at 7 mph (11 kph) northeast with sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph) and higher gusts, the hurricane center said.\n\nThe center forecast \"catastrophic flooding,\" with some areas along the Atlantic coast receiving 20 to 30 inches (76 cm) of rain by Friday morning. The governors of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina declared states of emergency in anticipation of Debby's damage.\n\nBy late afternoon on Monday, Debby had already dumped eight to 16 inches of rain in some parts of central Florida, according to local weather reports.\n\n\"This is going to be an event that is going to be probably here for the next five to seven days, maybe as long as 10 days, depending on how much rainfall we get,\" said Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management.\n\nOfficials in Georgia and South Carolina braced for flooding.\n\n\"It may be the most water we've seen in a long while,\" South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said at a briefing. \"There may be flooding in areas that never flooded in the past.\"\n\nSavannah Mayor Van Johnson said the city could expect a \"once in a thousand year\" rain event.\n\n\"This will literally create islands in the city,\" Johnson said.\n\nSLOW DRENCHING\n\nA slow-moving tropical storm as it passed over Cuba, Debby gained strength from exceptionally warm Gulf waters as it paralleled Florida's Gulf Coast on Sunday.\n\nDebby bears some of the hallmarks of Hurricane Harvey, which hit Corpus Christi, Texas, in August 2017. Downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved inland, Harvey lingered over Texas, dumping about 50 inches of rain on Houston and causing $125 billion in damage.\n\nClimate scientists believe man-made global warming from burning fossil fuels has raised the temperature of the oceans, making storms bigger and more devastating.\n\nThe last hurricane to make a direct hit on the Big Bend region was Hurricane Idalia, which briefly gained Category 4 strength before making landfall as a Category 3 in August 2023, with winds of more than 125 mph. The National Centers for Environmental Information estimated $3.5 billion in damages. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis described the initial effects of Debby as \"modest\" compared with Idalia.\n\nForecasters expect numerous Atlantic hurricanes in the 2024 season, which began on June 1, including four to seven major ones. That would exceed the record-breaking 2005 season that spawned the devastating Katrina and Rita hurricanes.\n\nOnly one other hurricane, Beryl, has formed in the Atlantic this year. The earliest Category 5 storm on record, it struck the Caribbean and Mexico's Yucatan peninsula before rolling up the Gulf Coast of Texas as a Category 1 storm, with sustained winds up to 95 mph.\n\n(Reporting by Rich McKay in Atlanta, Gabriella Borter in Washington, Andrew Hay in Taos, New Mexico, and Tyler Clifford in New York; Editing by David Gregorio, Stephen Coates and Sonali

Here's how much rain could fall", "body": "A home in Rubonia, Fla., is surrounded by floodwater after Tropical Storm Debby swept through the area, Monday, Aug. 5, 2024, in Bradenton, Fla. (Tiffany Tompkins/The Bradenton Herald via AP)\n\nNorthern Florida, the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina and parts of North Carolina are bracing for severe rain and catastrophic flooding this week as the Debby storm system moves up and east.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on the Big Bend coast of Florida early Monday, first hitting the small community of Steinhatchee. It damaged homes and businesses, sent floodwaters rising, caused sweeping power outages across the state and Georgia and led to several fatalities. Debby was downgraded to a tropical storm midday Monday.\n\nBut experts say the worst is yet to come as the storm system is expected to stall over the Southeast region.\n\nHow much rain is expected?\n\nForecasters say the system could pummel the Southeast with widespread areas of up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain and some totaling up to 30 inches (76 centimeters).\n\nThat would be a record-setting rainfall, shattering the record from a tropical system in 2018's Hurricane Florence. More than 23 inches (58 centimeters) of rain was recorded in South Carolina after that storm hit the Carolinas.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, \"It really is worthy of a Category 3 or 4 rating, if you want to talk about rainfall impacts,\" said Jeff Masters, founder of Weather Underground, now with Yale Climate Connections. \"That's going to cause a lot of damage.\"\n\nWhat areas are at risk?\n\nNorthern Florida as well as low-lying areas including Savannah, Georgia, and Hilton Head Island and Charleston, South Carolina, are expected to see the most severe flooding. North Carolina could also be impacted.\n\nOfficials in Savannah warned the area could see a month's worth of rain in four days if the system stalls. There were also flooding concerns for Tybee Island, Georgia's largest public beach 18 miles (28.97 kilometers) east of Savannah. On top of any torrential downpours that Debby dishes out, the island could get even wetter from 2 to 4 feet of storm surge, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Hilton Head Island Mayor Alan Perry said on a video posted to Facebook. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.\n\nFew places in South Carolina are as susceptible to flooding as Charleston. Much of the city and surrounding areas founded in 1670 were built on land created by using fill dirt and other debris. Rising sea levels cause a number of minor flooding events even without a storm and like many coastal cities, Charleston can't drain well.\n\nThe city doesn't expect a massive amount of flooding from the ocean, but the storm is still dangerous. Heavy rain can back up into the city, also causing flooding.\n\nWhat's causing this storm to stall?\n\nSome hurricanes make landfall and move quickly, experts say, while others slow substantially.\n\n\"Really what happened, and why the storm has stalled, is because there's basically high pressure areas to the west of the storm and to the northeast, and that's kind of pinned the storm,\" said Phil Klotzbach, senior research scientist at Colorado State University's Department of Atmospheric Science. \"With a hurricane you always have wind problems, but when you have a storm moving at 3 to 5 miles an hour, it's going to be over any specific location for a very long period of time, so flash flooding and just tremendous rainfall totals are going to be very likely.\"\n\nExperts say the warming atmosphere plays a role in the severity of storm surges such as Debby.\n\nWarming water in the northeast Gulf of Mexico is increasing Hurricane Debby's heavy rains, as more moisture evaporates from the waters, Masters said. Some research says climate change can impact the forward motion of hurricanes, he added, making them go slower.\n\n\"It's something we've been seeing more of lately,\" Masters said.\n\nHow long could this last?\n\nThe worst of the rain is expected during the first half of the week, but it could last through Saturday, forecasters said.\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit.

The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nFlorida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.\n\nNo deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nMayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island: Don't let your guard down\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nIn saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nPackages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nDebby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nBiden briefed on Debby's progress\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 50 mph (85 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was near the Florida-Georgia border and was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to decrease in speed as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nBig worry is storm surge from Debby\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nHundreds of thousands without power\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\n-- -\n\nThis version corrects the attribution for power outage figures to PowerOutage.us, not PowerOutage.com.", "source": {"uri":

Here's how much rain could fall", "body": "By ALEXA ST. JOHN - Associated Press\n\nNorthern Florida, the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina and parts of North Carolina are bracing for severe rain and catastrophic flooding this week as the Debby storm system moves up and east.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on the Big Bend coast of Florida early Monday, first hitting the small community of Steinhatchee. It damaged homes and businesses, sent floodwaters rising, caused sweeping power outages across the state and Georgia and led to several fatalities. Debby was downgraded to a tropical storm midday Monday.\n\nBut experts say the worst is yet to come as the storm system is expected to stall over the Southeast region.\n\nHow much rain is expected?\n\nForecasters say the system could pummel the Southeast with widespread areas of up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain and some totaling up to 30 inches (76 centimeters).\n\nThat would be a record-setting rainfall, shattering the record from a tropical system in 2018's Hurricane Florence. More than 23 inches (58 centimeters) of rain was recorded in South Carolina after that storm hit the Carolinas.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, \"It really is worthy of a Category 3 or 4 rating, if you want to talk about rainfall impacts,\" said Jeff Masters, founder of Weather Underground, now with Yale Climate Connections. \"That's going to cause a lot of damage.\"\n\nWhat areas are at risk?\n\nNorthern Florida as well as low-lying areas including Savannah, Georgia, and Hilton Head Island and Charleston, South Carolina, are expected to see the most severe flooding. North Carolina could also be impacted.\n\nOfficials in Savannah warned the area could see a month's worth of rain in four days if the system stalls. There were also flooding concerns for Tybee Island, Georgia's largest public beach 18 miles (28.97 kilometers) east of Savannah. On top of any torrential downpours that Debby dishes out, the island could get even wetter from 2 to 4 feet of storm surge, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Hilton Head Island Mayor Alan Perry said on a video posted to Facebook. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nFew places in South Carolina are as susceptible to flooding as Charleston. Much of the city and surrounding areas founded in 1670 were built on land created by using fill dirt and other debris. Rising sea levels cause a number of minor flooding events even without a storm and like many coastal cities, Charleston can't drain well.\n\nThe city doesn't expect a massive amount of flooding from the ocean, but the storm is still dangerous. Heavy rain can back up into the city, also causing flooding.\n\nWhat's causing this storm to stall?\n\nSome hurricanes make landfall and move quickly, experts say, while others slow substantially.\n\n\"Really what happened, and why the storm has stalled, is because there's basically high pressure areas to the west of the storm and to the northeast, and that's kind of pinned the storm,\" said Phil Klotzbach, senior research scientist at Colorado State University's Department of Atmospheric Science. \"With a hurricane you always have wind problems, but when you have a storm moving at 3 to 5 miles an hour, it's going to be over any specific location for a very long period of time, so flash flooding and just tremendous rainfall totals are going to be very likely.\"\n\nExperts say the warming atmosphere plays a role in the severity of storm surges such as Debby.\n\nWarming water in the northeast Gulf of Mexico is increasing Hurricane Debby's heavy rains, as more moisture evaporates from the waters, Masters said. Some research says climate change can impact the forward motion of hurricanes, he added, making them go slower.\n\n\"It's something we've been seeing more of lately,\" Masters said.\n\nHow long could this last?\n\nThe worst of the rain is expected during the first half of the week, but it could last through Saturday, forecasters said.\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit.

The slow-moving storm plowed into Florida's Gulf Coast around 7 a.m. (1100 GMT) on Monday morning as a Category 1 hurricane, making landfall near Steinhatchee about 70 miles (115 km) southeast of Tallahassee, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nThe storm carried hurricane-force winds of up to 80 mph (130 kph) when it struck in the Big Bend region - where the state's Panhandle meets its main north-south Peninsula - but speeds ebbed as Debby pushed over land. Trees felled in the storm killed a 12-year-old girl and a 13-year-old boy in Levy County, officials and law enforcement said. A 19-year-old man was killed near Valdosta, Georgia, when a tree fell onto a porch, police said.\n\nOthers killed in the storm included a truck driver who lost control of an 18-wheeler on Interstate 75 and went into the Tampa Bypass Canal, and a 38-year-old woman and her 12-year-old son whose SUV crashed in Dixie County north of Tampa in stormy weather, according to law enforcement. Roughly 150,000 customers were without power on Monday night in Florida, down from a peak of 350,000, according to Poweroutage.us, and flight trackers showed hundreds of flights originating from and heading to Florida airports were canceled on Monday.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris postponed a campaign stop scheduled this week in Savannah, Georgia, the Savannah Morning News reported. More than 500 people were rescued from flood waters from homes and vehicles in Sarasota, Florida, on Monday, police said, and about 180 people were rescued in Manatee County, officials said.\n\nThe hurricane center said Debby would cross Georgia and move offshore into the Atlantic Ocean by Tuesday night, then re-strengthen and make a second landfall, probably in South Carolina near Charleston. The storm was near the Florida-Georgia border late on Monday, about 35 miles (60 km) west of Brunswick, Georgia, and crawling at 7 mph (11 kph) northeast with sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph) and higher gusts, the hurricane center said.\n\nThe center forecast 'catastrophic flooding,' with some areas along the Atlantic coast receiving 20 to 30 inches (76 cm) of rain by Friday morning. The governors of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina declared states of emergency in anticipation of Debby's damage. By late afternoon on Monday, Debby had already dumped eight to 16 inches of rain in some parts of central Florida, according to local weather reports.\n\n'This is going to be an event that is going to be probably here for the next five to seven days, maybe as long as 10 days, depending on how much rainfall we get,' said Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management. Officials in Georgia and South Carolina braced for flooding.\n\n'It may be the most water we've seen in a long while,' South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said at a briefing. 'There may be flooding in areas that never flooded in the past.' Savannah Mayor Van Johnson said the city could expect a 'once in a thousand year' rain event.\n\n'This will literally create islands in the city,' Johnson said. SLOW DRENCHING\n\nA slow-moving tropical storm as it passed over Cuba, Debby gained strength from exceptionally warm Gulf waters as it paralleled Florida's Gulf Coast on Sunday. Debby bears some of the hallmarks of Hurricane Harvey, which hit Corpus Christi, Texas, in August 2017. Downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved inland, Harvey lingered over Texas, dumping about 50 inches of rain on Houston and causing $125 billion in damage.\n\nClimate scientists believe man-made global warming from burning fossil fuels has raised the temperature of the oceans, making storms bigger and more devastating. The last hurricane to make a direct hit on the Big Bend region was Hurricane Idalia, which briefly gained Category 4 strength before making landfall as a Category 3 in August 2023, with winds of more than 125 mph. The National Centers for Environmental Information estimated $3.5 billion in damages. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis described the initial effects of Debby as 'modest' compared with Idalia.\n\nForecasters expect numerous Atlantic hurricanes in the 2024 season, which began on June 1, including four to seven major ones. That would exceed the record-breaking 2005 season that spawned the devastating Katrina and Rita hurricanes. Only one other hurricane, Beryl, has formed in the Atlantic this year. The earliest Category 5 storm on record, it struck the Caribbean and Mexico's Yucatan peninsula before rolling up the Gulf Coast of Texas as a Category 1 storm, with sustained winds up to 95 mph.",

The governors of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina declared states of emergency in anticipation of Debby's damage.\n\nBy late afternoon on Monday, Debby had already dumped eight to 16 inches of rain in some parts of central Florida, according to local weather reports.\n\n\"This is going to be an event that is going to be probably here for the next five to seven days, maybe as long as 10 days, depending on how much rainfall we get,\" said Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management.\n\nOfficials in Georgia and South Carolina braced for flooding.\n\n\"It may be the most water we've seen in a long while,\" South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said at a briefing. \"There may be flooding in areas that never flooded in the past.\"\n\nSavannah Mayor Van Johnson said the city could expect a \"once in a thousand year\" rain event.\n\n\"This will literally create islands in the city,\" Johnson said.\n\nSLOW DRENCHING\n\nA slow-moving tropical storm as it passed over Cuba, Debby gained strength from exceptionally warm Gulf waters as it paralleled Florida's Gulf Coast on Sunday.\n\nDebby bears some of the hallmarks of Hurricane Harvey, which hit Corpus Christi, Texas, in August 2017. Downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved inland, Harvey lingered over Texas, dumping about 50 inches of rain on Houston and causing $125 billion in damage.\n\nClimate scientists believe man-made global warming from burning fossil fuels has raised the temperature of the oceans, making storms bigger and more devastating.\n\nThe last hurricane to make a direct hit on the Big Bend region was Hurricane Idalia, which briefly gained Category 4 strength before making landfall as a Category 3 in August 2023, with winds of more than 125 mph. The National Centers for Environmental Information estimated $3.5 billion in damages. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis described the initial effects of Debby as \"modest\" compared with Idalia.\n\nForecasters expect numerous Atlantic hurricanes in the 2024 season, which began on June 1, including four to seven major ones. That would exceed the record-breaking 2005 season that spawned the devastating Katrina and Rita hurricanes.\n\nOnly one other hurricane, Beryl, has formed in the Atlantic this year. The earliest Category 5 storm on record, it struck the Caribbean and Mexico's Yucatan peninsula before rolling up the Gulf Coast of Texas as a Category 1 storm, with sustained winds up to 95 mph.",

Forecasters warned heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia.\n\nBy The Associated Press\n\nHigh winds and heavy rains from Tropical Storm Debby lashed Florida on Monday. At least four deaths were reported in the state, and hundreds had to be rescued from flooded homes.\n\nThe storm is now threatening to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nHundreds rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, area, officials say\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said Monday in a social media post.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said in a social media update.\n\nJust north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"We are facing an unprecedented weather event with Hurricane Debby,\" said Jodie Fiske, Manatee County's public safety director. \"The safety of our residents is our top priority, and we are doing everything in our power to respond effectively to this crisis.\"\n\nMan killed when storm topples large tree onto home in south Georgia, officials say\n\nHeavy winds and rain associated with Debby toppled a large tree onto a porch at a home in south Georgia, killing a 19-year-old man, authorities said Monday.\n\nColquitt County Coroner C. Verlyn Brock said the man died at the home in the city of Moultrie, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Valdosta, Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.\n\nThe storm has damaged roofs and downed power lines in Moultrie, Police Chief Chad Castleberry told WALB-TV.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Debby had top winds near 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening as it moved slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns eastward.\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, announces curfew, roads into historic city to be closed\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, officials announced a curfew starting at 11 p.m. Monday for the peninsula that makes up much of downtown and the older parts of the 350-year-old city as some of the heaviest rain from Tropical Storm Debby is expected to fall overnight.\n\nPolice will barricade all eight roads leading into the peninsula and only let essential workers and emergency personnel in or out. High-water vehicles will also be staged to go into the area as needed, Charleston Mayor William Cogswell said at a Monday evening news conference.\n\n\"We need people to make their way out. This is not something you can stay at the bar until 10:45. We need you to take this seriously,\" Cogswell said.\n\nThe mayor said forecasters told him 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain could fall in Charleston overnight.\n\nCity officials will assess the situation early Tuesday and decide how and when to reopen roads and lift the curfew.\n\nNo evacuations planned for now in South Carolina, officials say\n\nState officials don't plan any evacuations in South Carolina for now as Tropical Storm Debby slowly spins toward the state.\n\nLarge-scale evacuations typically bring people inland from the coast, and forecasters say Debby's biggest impacts could be as much as 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain in localized areas throughout the state, causing floodwaters to rise quickly in small areas. So any evacuations will up to local leaders.\n\n\"This storm may not have the high winds of a hurricane, but it has the potential to cause life-threatening floods across the state. And I would like to emphasize that Tropical Storm Debby is not just a coastal event, but it is a statewide event,\" state Emergency Management Division Director Kim Stenson said at a Monday afternoon news conference.\n\nBiden approves request from South Carolina's governor for emergency declaration\n\nThe White House said Monday that President Joe Biden has approved a request from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said personnel from the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard are deploying to the region and are prepared to support recovery efforts.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday ahead of Debby's anticipated rainfall. Flooding and power outages are expected to start Tuesday and continue through the rest of the week, according to North Carolina Emergency Management officials.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis previously had declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida's 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also had made his own emergency declaration.\n\nCurfew announced for Savannah and surrounding county as Debby approaches\n\nWith Debby's winds and rains expected to worsen overnight, officials for Savannah and surrounding Chatham County announced that an overnight curfew will take effect at 10 p.m. Monday and run to 6 a.m. Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nFlorida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.\n\nNo deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nMayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island: Don't let your guard down\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nIn saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nPackages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nDebby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nBiden briefed on Debby's progress\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nBig worry is storm surge from Debby\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nHundreds of thousands without power\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\n-- -\n\nThis version corrects the attribution for power outage figures to PowerOutage.us, not PowerOutage.com.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Verlyn Brock, lost his life at a home in Moultrie, a city located approximately 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Valdosta, Georgia. This report was covered by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nThe storm has damaged roofs and downed power lines in Moultrie, Police Chief Chad Castleberry told WALB-TV.\n\nDebby, classified as a tropical storm by the National Hurricane Center, had maximum winds of about 45 mph (75 kph) by Monday evening as it made a slow northeastern progression. Its projected path included traversing southeastern Georgia and gradually slowing down to an eastward trajectory.\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, announces curfew, roads into historic city to be closed\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, officials announced a curfew starting at 11 p.m. Monday for the peninsula that makes up much of downtown and the older parts of the 350-year-old city as some of the heaviest rain from Tropical Storm Debby is expected to fall overnight.\n\nPolice will barricade all eight roads leading into the peninsula and only let essential workers and emergency personnel in or out. High-water vehicles will also be staged to go into the area as needed, Charleston Mayor William Cogswell said at a Monday evening news conference.\n\n\"We need people to make their way out. This is not something you can stay at the bar until 10:45. We need you to take this seriously,\" Cogswell said.\n\nThe mayor said forecasters told him 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain could fall in Charleston overnight.\n\nCity officials will assess the situation early Tuesday and decide how and when to reopen roads and lift the curfew.\n\nNo evacuations planned for now in South Carolina, officials say\n\nState officials don't plan any evacuations in South Carolina for now as Tropical Storm Debby slowly spins toward the state.\n\nLarge-scale evacuations typically bring people inland from the coast, and forecasters say Debby's biggest impacts could be as much as 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain in localized areas throughout the state, causing floodwaters to rise quickly in small areas. So any evacuations will up to local leaders.\n\n\"This storm may not have the high winds of a hurricane, but it has the potential to cause life-threatening floods across the state. And I would like to emphasize that Tropical Storm Debby is not just a coastal event, but it is a statewide event,\" state Emergency Management Division Director Kim Stenson said at a Monday afternoon news conference.\n\nBiden approves request from South Carolina's governor for emergency declaration\n\nThe White House said Monday that President Joe Biden has approved a request from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said personnel from the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard are deploying to the region and are prepared to support recovery efforts.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday ahead of Debby's anticipated rainfall. Flooding and power outages are expected to start Tuesday and continue through the rest of the week, according to North Carolina Emergency Management officials.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis previously had declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida's 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also had made his own emergency declaration.\n\nCurfew announced for Savannah and surrounding county as Debby approaches\n\nWith Debby's winds and rains expected to worsen overnight, officials for Savannah and surrounding Chatham County announced that an overnight curfew will take effect at 10 p.m. Monday and run to 6 a.m. Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nFlorida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.\n\nNo deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nMayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island: Don't let your guard down\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nIn saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nPackages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nDebby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nBiden briefed on Debby's progress\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nBig worry is storm surge from Debby\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nHundreds of thousands without power\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\n-- -\n\nThis version corrects the attribution for power outage figures to PowerOutage.us, not PowerOutage.com.", "source": {"uri":

Forecasters warned heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nMan killed when storm topples large tree onto home in south Georgia, officials say\n\nHeavy winds and rain associated with Debby toppled a large tree onto a porch at a home in south Georgia, killing a 19-year-old man, authorities said Monday.\n\nColquitt County Coroner C. Verlyn Brock said the man died at the home in the city of Moultrie, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Valdosta, Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.\n\nThe storm has damaged roofs and downed power lines in Moultrie, Police Chief Chad Castleberry told WALB-TV.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Debby had top winds near 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening as it moved slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns eastward.\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, announces curfew, roads into historic city to be closed\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, officials announced a curfew starting at 11 p.m. Monday for the peninsula that makes up much of downtown and the older parts of the 350-year-old city as some of the heaviest rain from Tropical Storm Debby is expected to fall overnight.\n\nPolice will barricade all eight roads leading into the peninsula and only let essential workers and emergency personnel in or out. High-water vehicles will also be staged to go into the area as needed, Charleston Mayor William Cogswell said at a Monday evening news conference.\n\n\"We need people to make their way out. This is not something you can stay at the bar until 10:45. We need you to take this seriously,\" Cogswell said.\n\nThe mayor said forecasters told him 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain could fall in Charleston overnight.\n\nCity officials will assess the situation early Tuesday and decide how and when to reopen roads and lift the curfew.\n\nNo evacuations planned for now in South Carolina, officials say\n\nState officials don't plan any evacuations in South Carolina for now as Tropical Storm Debby slowly spins toward the state.\n\nLarge-scale evacuations typically bring people inland from the coast, and forecasters say Debby's biggest impacts could be as much as 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain in localized areas throughout the state, causing floodwaters to rise quickly in small areas. So any evacuations will up to local leaders.\n\n\"This storm may not have the high winds of a hurricane, but it has the potential to cause life-threatening floods across the state. And I would like to emphasize that Tropical Storm Debby is not just a coastal event, but it is a statewide event,\" state Emergency Management Division Director Kim Stenson said at a Monday afternoon news conference.\n\nBiden approves request from South Carolina's governor for emergency declaration\n\nThe White House said Monday that President Joe Biden has approved a request from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said personnel from the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard are deploying to the region and are prepared to support recovery efforts.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday ahead of Debby's anticipated rainfall. Flooding and power outages are expected to start Tuesday and continue through the rest of the week, according to North Carolina Emergency Management officials.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis previously had declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida's 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also had made his own emergency declaration.\n\nCurfew announced for Savannah and surrounding county as Debby approaches\n\nWith Debby's winds and rains expected to worsen overnight, officials for Savannah and surrounding Chatham County announced that an overnight curfew will take effect at 10 p.m. Monday and run to 6 a.m. Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nFlorida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.\n\nNo deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nMayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island: Don't let your guard down\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nIn saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nPackages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nDebby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nBiden briefed on Debby's progress\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nBig worry is storm surge from Debby\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nHundreds of thousands without power\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\n-- -\n\nThis version corrects the attribution for power outage figures to PowerOutage.us, not PowerOutage.com.", "source": {"uri":

(NewsNation) -- Tropical Strom Debby has claimed five lives and led to the rescue of 500 others from flooded homes as Northern Florida, the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina and parts of North Carolina brace for severe weather.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center warned of \"life-threatening flash flooding and major river flooding,\" as the slow-moving storm brings torrential rains.\n\nMore than 140,000 people are without power across the Southeast. The heaviest rain is expected early in the week, but it could continue through Saturday, forecasters said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on Florida's Big Bend on Monday, hitting the small community of Steinhatchee first. It damaged homes and businesses and caused flooding before being downgraded to a tropical storm later that day.\n\nThe death toll from Debby has risen to five.\n\nIn Florida, a 13-year-old boy was killed when a tree fell onto a mobile home in Levy County, near Gainesville, NewsNation affiliate WKRN reported.\n\nIn Hillsborough County, near Tampa, a driver was found dead after his semitrailer became submerged in the Tampa Bypass Canal off Interstate 75 during the storm Monday.\n\nIn Dixie County, just west of Gainesville, officials reported that a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old died when their car crashed into a guardrail on U.S. Highway 19 on Sunday night.\n\nIn southern Georgia, a 19-year-old was killed after a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Moultrie Observer reported.\n\nForecasters predict the system could bring up to 20 inches of rain to widespread areas of the Southeast, with some areas getting up to 30 inches.\n\nThat would be a record-setting rainfall, shattering the record from a tropical system in 2018's Hurricane Florence. More than 23 inches of rain was recorded in South Carolina after that storm hit the Carolinas.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, \"It really is worthy of a Category 3 or 4 rating, if you want to talk about rainfall impacts,\" said Jeff Masters, founder of Weather Underground, now with Yale Climate Connections. \"That's going to cause a lot of damage.\"\n\nNorthern Florida and low-lying areas including Savannah, Georgia, and Hilton Head Island and Charleston, South Carolina, are expected to see the most severe flooding. North Carolina could also be impacted.\n\nOfficials in Savannah warned the area could see a month's worth of rain in four days if the system stalls. There were also flooding concerns for Tybee Island, Georgia's largest public beach 18 miles east of Savannah. On top of any torrential downpours that Debby dishes out, the island could get even wetter from 2 to 4 feet of storm surge, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall, but we have to prepare for the worst,\" Hilton Head Island Mayor Alan Perry said on a video posted to Facebook. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Charleston County interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.\n\nFew places in South Carolina are as susceptible to flooding as Charleston. Much of the city and surrounding areas founded in 1670 were built on land created by using fill dirt and other debris. Rising sea levels cause a number of minor flooding events even without a storm and like many coastal cities, Charleston can't drain well.\n\nThe city doesn't expect a massive amount of flooding from the ocean, but the storm is still dangerous. Heavy rain can back up into the city, also causing flooding.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It damaged homes and businesses, sent floodwaters rising, caused sweeping power outages across the state and Georgia and led to several fatalities.

Heavy rain can back up into the city, also causing flooding.\n\nWhat's causing this storm to stall?\n\nSome hurricanes make landfall and move quickly, experts say, while others slow substantially.\n\n\"Really what happened, and why the storm has stalled, is because there's basically high pressure areas to the west of the storm and to the northeast, and that's kind of pinned the storm,\" said Phil Klotzbach, senior research scientist at Colorado State University's Department of Atmospheric Science. \"With a hurricane you always have wind problems, but when you have a storm moving at 3 to 5 miles an hour, it's going to be over any specific location for a very long period of time, so flash flooding and just tremendous rainfall totals are going to be very likely.\"\n\nExperts say the warming atmosphere plays a role in the severity of storm surges such as Debby.\n\nWarming water in the northeast Gulf of Mexico is increasing Hurricane Debby's heavy rains, as more moisture evaporates from the waters, Masters said. Some research says climate change can impact the forward motion of hurricanes, he added, making them go slower.\n\n\"It's something we've been seeing more of lately,\" Masters said.\n\nHow long could this last?\n\nThe worst of the rain is expected during the first half of the week, but it could last through Saturday, forecasters said.\n\n___\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit.

The slow-moving storm plowed into Florida's Gulf Coast around 7 a.m. on Monday morning as a Category 1 hurricane, making landfall near Steinhatchee about 70 miles (115 km) southeast of Tallahassee, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm carried hurricane-force winds of up to 80 mph (130 kph) when it struck in the Big Bend region - where the state's Panhandle meets its main north-south Peninsula - but speeds ebbed as Debby pushed over land. Trees felled in the storm killed a 12-year-old girl and a 13-year-old boy in Levy County, officials and law enforcement said. Others killed in the storm included a truck driver who lost control of an 18-wheeler on Interstate 75 and went into the Tampa Bypass Canal, and a 38-year-old woman and her 12-year-old son whose SUV crashed in Dixie County north of Tampa in stormy weather, according to law enforcement. Roughly 240,000 customers were without power in Florida, according to Poweroutage.us, and flight trackers showed hundreds of flights originating from and heading to Florida airports were canceled on Monday. The hurricane center said Debby would cross Georgia and move offshore into the Atlantic Ocean by Tuesday night, then re-strengthen and make a second landfall, probably in South Carolina near Charleston. The storm was near the Florida-Georgia border by early evening on Monday, about 30 miles southeast of Valdosta, Georgia, and crawling at 6 mph northeast with sustained winds of 50 mph, the hurricane center said. The center forecast \"catastrophic flooding,\" with some areas along the Atlantic coast receiving 20 to 30 inches (76 cm) of rain by Friday morning. The governors of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina declared states of emergency in anticipation of Debby's damage. By late afternoon on Monday, Debby had already dumped eight to 16 inches of rain in some parts of central Florida, according to local weather reports. \"This is going to be an event that is going to be probably here for the next five to seven days, maybe as long as 10 days, depending on how much rainfall we get,\" said Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management. Officials in Georgia and South Carolina braced for flooding. \"It may be the most water we've seen in a long while,\" South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said at a briefing. \"There may be flooding in areas that never flooded in the past.\" Savannah Mayor Van Johnson said the city could expect a \"once in a thousand year\" rain event. \"This will literally create islands in the city,\" Johnson said. A slow-moving tropical storm as it passed over Cuba, Debby gained strength from exceptionally warm Gulf waters as it paralleled Florida's Gulf Coast on Sunday. Debby bears some of the hallmarks of Hurricane Harvey, which hit Corpus Christi, Texas, in August 2017. Downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved inland, Harvey lingered over Texas, dumping about 50 inches of rain on Houston and causing $125 billion in damage.", "source": {"uri": "thedailyherald.sx",

The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nDebby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nBiden briefed on Debby's progress\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 70 mph (110 kph). The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast, and was expected to decrease in speed as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia.\n\nBig worry is storm surge from Debby\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nHundreds of thousands without power\n\nMore than 350,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday, according to PowerOutage.com.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up.

Verlyn Brock said the man died at the home in the city of Moultrie, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Valdosta, Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.\n\nThe storm has damaged roofs and downed power lines in Moultrie, Police Chief Chad Castleberry told WALB-TV.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Debby had top winds near 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening as it moved slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns eastward.\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, announces curfew, roads into historic city to be closed\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, officials announced a curfew starting at 11 p.m. Monday for the peninsula that makes up much of downtown and the older parts of the 350-year-old city as some of the heaviest rain from Tropical Storm Debby is expected to fall overnight.\n\nPolice will barricade all eight roads leading into the peninsula and only let essential workers and emergency personnel in or out. High-water vehicles will also be staged to go into the area as needed, Charleston Mayor William Cogswell said at a Monday evening news conference.\n\n\"We need people to make their way out. This is not something you can stay at the bar until 10:45. We need you to take this seriously,\" Cogswell said.\n\nThe mayor said forecasters told him 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain could fall in Charleston overnight.\n\nCity officials will assess the situation early Tuesday and decide how and when to reopen roads and lift the curfew.\n\nNo evacuations planned for now in South Carolina, officials say\n\nState officials don't plan any evacuations in South Carolina for now as Tropical Storm Debby slowly spins toward the state.\n\nLarge-scale evacuations typically bring people inland from the coast, and forecasters say Debby's biggest impacts could be as much as 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain in localized areas throughout the state, causing floodwaters to rise quickly in small areas. So any evacuations will up to local leaders.\n\n\"This storm may not have the high winds of a hurricane, but it has the potential to cause life-threatening floods across the state. And I would like to emphasize that Tropical Storm Debby is not just a coastal event, but it is a statewide event,\" state Emergency Management Division Director Kim Stenson said at a Monday afternoon news conference.\n\nBiden approves request from South Carolina's governor for emergency declaration\n\nThe White House said Monday that President Joe Biden has approved a request from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said personnel from the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard are deploying to the region and are prepared to support recovery efforts.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday ahead of Debby's anticipated rainfall. Flooding and power outages are expected to start Tuesday and continue through the rest of the week, according to North Carolina Emergency Management officials.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis previously had declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida's 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also had made his own emergency declaration.\n\nCurfew announced for Savannah and surrounding county as Debby approaches\n\nWith Debby's winds and rains expected to worsen overnight, officials for Savannah and surrounding Chatham County announced that an overnight curfew will take effect at 10 p.m. Monday and run to 6 a.m. Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nFlorida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.\n\nNo deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nMayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island: Don't let your guard down\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nIn saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nPackages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nDebby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nBiden briefed on Debby's progress\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nBig worry is storm surge from Debby\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nHundreds of thousands without power\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\n-- -\n\nThis version corrects the attribution for power outage figures to PowerOutage.us, not PowerOutage.com.", "source": {"uri":

At least four deaths were reported in the state, and hundreds had to be rescued from flooded homes.\n\nThe storm is now threatening to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nHundreds rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, area, officials say\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said Monday in a social media post.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said in a social media update.\n\nJust north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"We are facing an unprecedented weather event with Hurricane Debby,\" said Jodie Fiske, Manatee County's public safety director. \"The safety of our residents is our top priority, and we are doing everything in our power to respond effectively to this crisis.\"\n\nMan killed when storm topples large tree onto home in south Georgia, officials say\n\nHeavy winds and rain associated with Debby toppled a large tree onto a porch at a home in south Georgia, killing a 19-year-old man, authorities said Monday.\n\nColquitt County Coroner C. Verlyn Brock said the man died at the home in the city of Moultrie, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Valdosta, Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.\n\nThe storm has damaged roofs and downed power lines in Moultrie, Police Chief Chad Castleberry told WALB-TV.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Debby had top winds near 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening as it moved slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns eastward.\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, announces curfew, roads into historic city to be closed\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, officials announced a curfew starting at 11 p.m. Monday for the peninsula that makes up much of downtown and the older parts of the 350-year-old city as some of the heaviest rain from Tropical Storm Debby is expected to fall overnight.\n\nPolice will barricade all eight roads leading into the peninsula and only let essential workers and emergency personnel in or out. High-water vehicles will also be staged to go into the area as needed, Charleston Mayor William Cogswell said at a Monday evening news conference.\n\n\"We need people to make their way out. This is not something you can stay at the bar until 10:45. We need you to take this seriously,\" Cogswell said.\n\nThe mayor said forecasters told him 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain could fall in Charleston overnight.\n\nCity officials will assess the situation early Tuesday and decide how and when to reopen roads and lift the curfew.\n\nNo evacuations planned for now in South Carolina, officials say\n\nState officials don't plan any evacuations in South Carolina for now as Tropical Storm Debby slowly spins toward the state.\n\nLarge-scale evacuations typically bring people inland from the coast, and forecasters say Debby's biggest impacts could be as much as 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain in localized areas throughout the state, causing floodwaters to rise quickly in small areas. So any evacuations will up to local leaders.\n\n\"This storm may not have the high winds of a hurricane, but it has the potential to cause life-threatening floods across the state. And I would like to emphasize that Tropical Storm Debby is not just a coastal event, but it is a statewide event,\" state Emergency Management Division Director Kim Stenson said at a Monday afternoon news conference.\n\nBiden approves request from South Carolina's governor for emergency declaration\n\nThe White House said Monday that President Joe Biden has approved a request from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said personnel from the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard are deploying to the region and are prepared to support recovery efforts.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday ahead of Debby's anticipated rainfall. Flooding and power outages are expected to start Tuesday and continue through the rest of the week, according to North Carolina Emergency Management officials.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis previously had declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida's 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also had made his own emergency declaration.\n\nCurfew announced for Savannah and surrounding county as Debby approaches\n\nWith Debby's winds and rains expected to worsen overnight, officials for Savannah and surrounding Chatham County announced that an overnight curfew will take effect at 10 p.m. Monday and run to 6 a.m. Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nFlorida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.\n\nNo deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nMayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island: Don't let your guard down\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nIn saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nPackages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nDebby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nBiden briefed on Debby's progress\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nBig worry is storm surge from Debby\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nHundreds of thousands without power\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\n-- -\n\nThis version corrects the attribution for power outage figures to PowerOutage.us, not PowerOutage.com.", "source": {"uri":

Tropical-storm-force winds extend out 205 miles, mostly to the east of the storm.\n\n\"A slow motion toward the east and then north is expected through Thursday night,\" said NHC senior hurricane specialist Richard Pasch. \"On the forecast track, the center of Debby is expected to move offshore the coast of Georgia later today, drift offshore through early Thursday, and then move inland over South Carolina on Thursday.\"\n\nThe storm came ashore as Category 1 Hurricane Debby with sustained winds of 80 mph on Monday morning near Steinhatchee, Florida in the state's Big Bend region before slowing down and dropping torrents of rain as it made its way across North Florida into Georgia.\n\n\"Debby is expected to produce potentially historic rainfall totals of 10 to 20 inches, with maximum amounts of 25 inches, bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across portions of southeast Georgia, the eastern half of South Carolina, and southeast North Carolina through Friday,\" Pasch said.\n\nFlorida, which already endured flooding rains as it passed s expected to get another 1-2 inches across portions of the peninsula today still with some areas getting up to another 4 inches.\n\nNorthern North Carolina and the mid-Atlantic states could get 4 to 8 inches of rain with some areas getting 12 inches through Sunday morning.\n\n\"This rainfall will likely result in areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, with river flooding possible,\" Pasch said.\n\nDeadly Debby back to tropical storm as it moves inland, but flooding still a threat\n\nA tropical storm warning remains in effect for Altamaha Sound, Georgia to Little River Inlet, South Carolina with a tropical storm watch from north of Little River Inlet, South Carolina to Surf City, North Carolina. A storm surge warning is in effect from Altamaha Sound, Georgia to South Santee River, South Carolina and storm surge watch from North of South Santee River, South Carolina to Cape Fear, North Carolina.\n\n\"Tropical storm conditions are expected over portions of the tropical storm warning area along the Georgia coast through this morning,\" Pasch said. \"Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue along the coast of South Carolina within the tropical storm warning area through Thursday night. Tropical storm conditions are possible within the tropical storm watch area in North Carolina beginning Wednesday night.\"\n\nThe NHC is also continuing to track a system in the Caribbean with a low chance to form into the season's next tropical depression or storm.\n\nThe area associated with a tropical wave with showers and thunderstorms is moving across the east-central Caribbean Sea.\n\n\"Any development of this system should be slow to occur during the next couple of days while it moves westward over the central Caribbean Sea,\" forecasters said. \"Environmental conditions are expected to become more conducive for development later this week as the system moves across the western Caribbean Sea or the southern Gulf of Mexico.\"\n\nThe NHC gives the system a 10% chance of developing in the next two days and 30% in the next seven.\n\nIf it were to become a named system, it could become Tropical Storm Ernesto.\n\nHurricane Debby was the second hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season and fourth named system overall. It was also the fourth hurricane to hit Florida since 2000 in the month of August following 2004's Hurricane Charley, 2005's Katrina and last year's Hurricane Idalia, which struck just 15 miles north of where Debby made landfall.", "source": {"uri": "orlandosentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Orlando Sentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "richard_tribou@orlandosentinel.com", "name": "Richard

The driver was killed. The truck's cab broke off and dropped into the Tampa Bypass Canal. Sheriff's office divers located the 64-year-old man from New Albany, Mississippi in the cab 40 feet below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nHORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with catastrophic flooding and was blamed for at least four deaths, with Georgia and South Carolina next in line as the system rips across the southeastern United States.\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina, and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over the gulf coast of Florida.\n\nThe tropical storm was moving slowly, covering roads with water and contributing to at least four deaths.\n\nA truck driver died on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nAnd in Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night. The Florida Highway Patrol said a 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries.\n\nMore than 300,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up.\"\n\nAirports were also affected. More than 1,600 flights had been canceled nationwide, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday. Nearly 30% of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport were canceled.\n\nSarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, was one of the hardest hit by flooding.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" said Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun in a social media update.\n\nThe storm made landfall early Monday morning near Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nTaylor County, where Steinhatchee is located, closed several roads due to flooding, Sheriff Wayne Padgett said. Trees and power lines had also fallen across some roads. Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying or coastal areas to wait before returning to their homes because the tide had not come in, and it was unclear how deep floodwaters might get later.\n\nLooking out over the Steinhatchee River from the condo above the marina he operates, Chris Williams said he was feeling blessed that the damage wasn't worse. Williams said his power went out at about 5:30 a.m. Monday as the storm was washing ashore, jamming the dock-studded riverfront with tree debris and barrels.\n\nThe small community is roughly 20 miles (32 kilometers) from where Hurricane Idalia crashed ashore less than a year ago.\n\n\"Two in less than a year is pretty bad,\" Williams said. \"You do everything you can possibly do to prepare. And when you've done that, clean up and put it back together and move forward.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has postponed a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby. Harris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nOn Monday, local leaders in Savannah said flooding could happen in areas that don't usually get high water if Debby stalls out over the city.\n\n\"This type of rain hovering over us, coming with the intensity that they tell us it is coming, it's going to catch a whole lot of people by surprise,\" said Chatham County Chairman Chester Ellis.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.\n\nThe city of Charleston has an emergency plan in place that includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding.\n\nIn 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.\n\nIn Savannah, Jim Froncak piled sandbags into his pickup truck on Monday, as rain was already falling. He said a recent thunderstorm caused so much flooding that he and a friend were able to kayak down a street.\n\n\"That was just a thunderstorm,\" he said. \"So, who knows what could happen with this?\"\n\nThis story has been updated to correct that the Big Bend area is north of Tampa, not south of Tampa.\n\nMartin reported from Atlanta.

High-water vehicles will also be staged to go into the area as needed, Charleston Mayor William Cogswell said at a Monday evening news conference.\n\n\"We need people to make their way out. This is not something you can stay at the bar until 10:45. We need you to take this seriously,\" Cogswell said.\n\nThe mayor said forecasters told him 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain could fall in Charleston overnight.\n\nCity officials will assess the situation early Tuesday and decide how and when to reopen roads and lift the curfew.\n\nNo evacuations planned for now in South Carolina, officials say\n\nState officials don't plan any evacuations in South Carolina for now as Tropical Storm Debby slowly spins toward the state.\n\nLarge-scale evacuations typically bring people inland from the coast, and forecasters say Debby's biggest impacts could be as much as 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain in localized areas throughout the state, causing floodwaters to rise quickly in small areas. So any evacuations will up to local leaders.\n\n\"This storm may not have the high winds of a hurricane, but it has the potential to cause life-threatening floods across the state. And I would like to emphasize that Tropical Storm Debby is not just a coastal event, but it is a statewide event,\" state Emergency Management Division Director Kim Stenson said at a Monday afternoon news conference.\n\nBiden approves request from South Carolina's governor for emergency declaration\n\nThe White House said Monday that President Joe Biden has approved a request from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said personnel from the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard are deploying to the region and are prepared to support recovery efforts.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday ahead of Debby's anticipated rainfall. Flooding and power outages are expected to start Tuesday and continue through the rest of the week, according to North Carolina Emergency Management officials.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis previously had declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida's 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also had made his own emergency declaration.\n\nCurfew announced for Savannah and surrounding county as Debby approaches\n\nWith Debby's winds and rains expected to worsen overnight, officials for Savannah and surrounding Chatham County announced that an overnight curfew will take effect at 10 p.m. Monday and run to 6 a.m. Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nFlorida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.\n\nNo deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nMayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island: Don't let your guard down\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nIn saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nPackages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nDebby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nBiden briefed on Debby's progress\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 50 mph (85 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was near the Florida-Georgia border and was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to decrease in speed as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nBig worry is storm surge from Debby\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nHundreds of thousands without power\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\n-- -\n\nThis version corrects the attribution for power outage figures to PowerOutage.us, not PowerOutage.com.", "source": {"uri":

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with catastrophic flooding and was blamed for at least four deaths, with Georgia and South Carolina next in line as the system rips across the southeastern United States.\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina, and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches of rainfall in some areas. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over the gulf coast of Florida.\n\nThe tropical storm was moving slowly, covering roads with water and contributing to at least four deaths.\n\nA truck driver died on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nAnd in Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night. The Florida Highway Patrol said a 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries.\n\nHundreds of thousands of customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen were working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up.\"\n\nAirports were also affected. More than 1,600 flights had been canceled nationwide, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday. Nearly 30% of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport were canceled.\n\nSarasota, a beach city popular with tourists, was one of the hardest hit by flooding.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" said Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun in a social media update.\n\nThe storm made landfall early Monday morning near Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nTaylor County, where Steinhatchee is located, closed several roads due to flooding, Sheriff Wayne Padgett said. Trees and power lines had also fallen across some roads. Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying or coastal areas to wait before returning to their homes because the tide had not come in, and it was unclear how deep floodwaters might get later.\n\nLooking out over the Steinhatchee River from the condo above the marina he operates, Chris Williams said he was feeling blessed that the damage wasn't worse. Williams said his power went out at about 5:30 a.m. Monday as the storm was washing ashore, jamming the dock-studded riverfront with tree debris and barrels.\n\nThe small community is roughly 20 miles (32 kilometers) from where Hurricane Idalia crashed ashore less than a year ago.\n\n\"Two in less than a year is pretty bad,\" Williams said. \"You do everything you can possibly do to prepare. And when you've done that, clean up and put it back together and move forward.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Del., the White House said.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has postponed a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby. Harris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Ga., on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"},

Savannah Mayor Van Johnson told residents to expect a rough day Tuesday. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, which is based on wind speeds, meteorologists say it's the storm's rainfall capacity that makes it extremely dangerous.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nDebby still getting energy from ocean water, expert says\n\nDebby has weakened over land because tropical cyclones derive their energy from warm water, but part of the circulation was still interacting Tuesday with water over the Atlantic, said Richard Pasch, a senior hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe storm's center is expected to move out over the water off the Georgia and South Carolina coast, then move back inland, so it could restrengthen, but it's not clear how much, he said.\n\nTropical storm warnings were posted from northeastern Florida up into North Carolina, and very heavy rain is expected, leading to catastrophic flooding across parts of southeastern Georgia, the eastern half of South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina through Friday, he said.\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" he said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nCharleston ready with sandbags, parking garages\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nDebby's center was over southeastern Georgia early Tuesday with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (75 kph), and it was moving northeast near 7 mph (11 kph). The center is expected to move off Georgia's coast later Tuesday. Some strengthening is forecast on Wednesday and Thursday as Debby drifts offshore, before it moves inland over South Carolina on Thursday.\n\nThe emergency plan in the city of Charleston, South Carolina, includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters, and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed by flooding.\n\nHundreds rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, area, officials say\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said Monday in a social media post.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said in a social media update.\n\nJust north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"We are facing an unprecedented weather event with Hurricane Debby,\" said Jodie Fiske, Manatee County's public safety director. \"The safety of our residents is our top priority, and we are doing everything in our power to respond effectively to this crisis.\"\n\nMan killed when storm topples large tree onto home in south Georgia, officials say\n\nHeavy winds and rain associated with Debby toppled a large tree onto a porch at a home in south Georgia, killing a 19-year-old man, authorities said Monday.\n\nColquitt County Coroner C. Verlyn Brock said the man died at the home in the city of Moultrie, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Valdosta, Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.\n\nThe storm has damaged roofs and downed power lines in Moultrie, Police Chief Chad Castleberry told WALB-TV.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Debby had top winds near 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening as it moved slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns eastward.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

North Carolina could also be impacted.\n\nOfficials in Savannah warned the area could see a month's worth of rain in four days if the storm stalls.\n\nThere were also flooding concerns for Tybee Island, Georgia's largest public beach. On top of any torrential downpours that Debby dishes out, the island could see 2 to 4 feet of storm surge, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Hilton Head Island Mayor Alan Perry said on a video posted to Facebook. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nHilton Head Island declared a State of Emergency on Sunday.\n\nCharleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster emphasized that Debby was a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" in a briefing Monday morning.\n\nThe storm is set to cause more damage because it has stalled-this is because of high pressure areas to the west and northeast of the storm that have \"pinned the storm,\" said Phil Klotzbach, senior research scientist at Colorado State University's Department of Atmospheric Science.\n\n\"When you have a storm moving at 3 to 5 miles an hour, it's going to be over any specific location for a very long period of time, so flash flooding and just tremendous rainfall totals are going to be very likely.\"\n\nWarming water in the northeast Gulf of Mexico is increasing Hurricane Debby's heavy rains, as more moisture evaporates from the waters, Masters said. Some research says climate change can impact the forward motion of hurricanes, he added, making them go slower.\n\n\"It's something we've been seeing more of lately,\" Masters said.\n\nThe worst of the rain is expected during the first half the week, but it could last until Sunday, according to forecasters.", "source": {"uri": "idahostatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Idaho

Both Savannah and Charleston announced curfews Monday night into Tuesday.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday.\n\nIn addition to the curfew, the city of Charleston's emergency plan includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding.\n\nIn Edisto Beach, South Carolina, a tornado touched down Monday night, damaging trees, homes and taking down power lines, the Colleton County Sheriff's Office said on social media. No injuries were immediately reported, officials said.\n\nThe National Weather Service continued issuing tornado warnings well into Monday night for parts of the state including in the island town of Hilton Head.\n\nDebby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It has weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, drenching and bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across portions of eastern Georgia, the coastal plain of South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Wednesday.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said in a social media post. Just north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said on social media.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that the state could continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" he said. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nFive people had died due to the storm as of Monday night, including a truck driver on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office. In Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night.\n\nIn southern Georgia, a 19-year-old man died Monday afternoon when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n\nNearly 160,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday night, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were also canceled nationwide on Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved a request from South Carolina's governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he has asked Biden to issue a preemptive federal emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to the state.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris postponed a campaign stop scheduled for Thursday in Savannah.\n\nNorth Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed Monday. Several areas along the state's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfew", "type": "wiki",

The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nFlorida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.\n\nNo deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nMayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island: Don't let your guard down\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nIn saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nPackages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nDebby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nBiden briefed on Debby's progress\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 50 mph (85 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was near the Florida-Georgia border and was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to decrease in speed as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nBig worry is storm surge from Debby\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nHundreds of thousands without power\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\n-- -\n\nThis version corrects the attribution for power outage figures to PowerOutage.us, not PowerOutage.com.", "source": {"uri":

High-water vehicles will also be staged to go into the area as needed, Charleston Mayor William Cogswell said at a Monday evening news conference.\n\n\"We need people to make their way out. This is not something you can stay at the bar until 10:45. We need you to take this seriously,\" Cogswell said.\n\nThe mayor said forecasters told him 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain could fall in Charleston overnight.\n\nCity officials will assess the situation early Tuesday and decide how and when to reopen roads and lift the curfew.\n\nNo evacuations planned for now in South Carolina, officials say\n\nState officials don't plan any evacuations in South Carolina for now as Tropical Storm Debby slowly spins toward the state.\n\nLarge-scale evacuations typically bring people inland from the coast, and forecasters say Debby's biggest impacts could be as much as 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain in localized areas throughout the state, causing floodwaters to rise quickly in small areas. So any evacuations will up to local leaders.\n\n\"This storm may not have the high winds of a hurricane, but it has the potential to cause life-threatening floods across the state. And I would like to emphasize that Tropical Storm Debby is not just a coastal event, but it is a statewide event,\" state Emergency Management Division Director Kim Stenson said at a Monday afternoon news conference.\n\nBiden approves request from South Carolina's governor for emergency declaration\n\nThe White House said Monday that President Joe Biden has approved a request from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said personnel from the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard are deploying to the region and are prepared to support recovery efforts.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday ahead of Debby's anticipated rainfall. Flooding and power outages are expected to start Tuesday and continue through the rest of the week, according to North Carolina Emergency Management officials.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis previously had declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida's 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also had made his own emergency declaration.\n\nCurfew announced for Savannah and surrounding county as Debby approaches\n\nWith Debby's winds and rains expected to worsen overnight, officials for Savannah and surrounding Chatham County announced that an overnight curfew will take effect at 10 p.m. Monday and run to 6 a.m. Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nFlorida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.\n\nNo deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nMayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island: Don't let your guard down\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nIn saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nPackages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nDebby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nBiden briefed on Debby's progress\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 50 mph (85 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was near the Florida-Georgia border and was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to decrease in speed as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nBig worry is storm surge from Debby\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nHundreds of thousands without power\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\n-- -\n\nThis version corrects the attribution for power outage figures to PowerOutage.us, not PowerOutage.com.", "source": {"uri":

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with catastrophic flooding and was blamed for at least four deaths, with Georgia and South Carolina next in line as the system rips across the southeastern United States.\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina, and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said. Debby had made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over the gulf coast of Florida.\n\nThe tropical storm was moving slowly across Florida, covering roads with water and contributing to at least four deaths.\n\nA truck driver died on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nAnd in Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night. The Florida Highway Patrol said a 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries.\n\nMore than 300,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up.\"\n\nAirports were also affected. More than 1,600 flights had been canceled nationwide; many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday. Nearly 30% of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport were canceled.\n\nSarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, was one of the hardest-hit by flooding.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" said Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun in a social media update.\n\nThe storm made landfall early Monday morning near Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nTaylor County, where Steinhatchee is located, closed several roads due to flooding, Sheriff Wayne Padgett said. Trees and power lines had also fallen across some roads. Padgett advised anyone who evacuated from low-lying or coastal areas to wait before returning to their homes because the tide had not come in, and it was unclear how deep flood waters might get later.\n\nLooking out over the Steinhatchee River from the condo above the marina he operates, Chris Williams said he was feeling blessed that the damage wasn't worse. Williams said his power went out at about 5:30 a.m. Monday as the storm was washing ashore, jamming the dock-studded riverfront with tree debris and barrels.\n\nThe small community is roughly 20 miles (32 kilometers) from where Hurricane Idalia crashed ashore less than a year ago.\n\n\"Two in less than a year is pretty bad,\" Williams said. \"You do everything you can possibly do to prepare. And when you've done that, clean up and put it back together and move forward.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has postponed a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby. Harris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nOn Monday, local leaders in Savannah said flooding could happen in areas that don't usually get high water if Debby stalls out over the city.\n\n\"This type of rain hovering over us, coming with the intensity that they tell us it is coming, it's going to catch a whole lot of people by surprise,\" said Chatham County Chairman Chester Ellis.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.\n\nThe city of Charleston has an emergency plan in place that includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding.\n\nIn 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.\n\nIn Savannah, Jim Froncak piled sandbags into his pickup truck on Monday, as rain was already falling. He said a recent thunderstorm caused so much flooding that he and a friend were able to kayak down a street.\n\n\"That was just a thunderstorm,\" he said. \"So, who knows what could happen with this?\"\n\nThis story has been updated to correct that the Big Bend area is north of Tampa, not south of Tampa.\n\nMartin reported from Atlanta.

were killed as Tropical Storm Debby drenched Florida on Monday, threatening southeastern US states with heavy rainfall and catastrophic flooding.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died when a tree was blown onto a mobile home in Levy County, the sheriff's office there said, after Debby made landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast earlier Monday as a Category One hurricane.\n\nAuthorities said a truck driver was killed after his 18-wheeler plunged into a canal in Hillsborough County, while a 38-year-old woman and 12-year-old boy died in a car crash in Dixie County.\n\nThe storm moved into Georgia overnight and is expected to go offshore before approaching the South Carolina coast on Thursday, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC).\n\n\"This is a level four out of four risk for excessive rainfall,\" Michael Brennan, director of the NHC, told reporters.\n\n\"This is going to result in a prolonged extreme rainfall event with potential for catastrophic flooding across coastal portions of Georgia, South Carolina, even extending up into North Carolina,\" he added.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis said that some 250,000 residents in his state were without power.\n\n\"Please, be very cautious when you're going out,\" he said, adding that Debby's winds had not been as damaging as previous hurricanes that have hit Florida.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has approved emergency declarations for Florida and South Carolina, allowing for federal assistance in coordinating disaster relief efforts.\n\nDeSantis also activated his state's National Guard, with more than 3,000 service members mobilized to help with storm response.\n\n- Evacuation orders -\n\nBy Monday evening, the NHC said the storm was registering maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph) as it swept into Georgia.\n\nStorm surge warnings -- signalling a life-threatening inundation from rising water -- are in effect in parts of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.\n\nDebby was expected to bring \"potentially historic rainfall\" of up to 30 inches as it moved north, the NHC said.\n\nBut it said the storm was weakening after making landfall earlier with sustained speeds of 80 mph (130 kph) as a Category One hurricane -- the lowest on a scale of five.\n\nMandatory evacuations were ordered for part of Citrus County, Florida, with several other counties under voluntary evacuation orders, local media reported.\n\nThe governors of Georgia and South Carolina declared a state of emergency ahead of Debby's arrival.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris -- the Democratic candidate in the US election -- postponed events in North Carolina and Georgia this week due to the storm, according to local media reports citing her campaign team.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Border Patrol announced that Debby had washed up 25 packages of cocaine worth around $1 million to the coast of the Florida Keys, where they were seized.\n\nIn July, at least 18 people were killed when the powerful Hurricane Beryl tore through the Caribbean before hitting the southern US states of Texas and Louisiana.\n\nScientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of storms such as Beryl because there is more energy in a warmer ocean for them to feed on.", "source": {"uri": "bssnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS)"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Florida coast with torrential rain and high winds, 4 killed", "body": "In July, at least 18 people were killed when the powerful Hurricane Beryl tore through the Caribbean before hitting the southern US states of Texas and Louisiana.\n\nTropical Storm Debby drenched Florida on Monday, killing at least four people and threatening southeastern US states with heavy rainfall and catastrophic flooding.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died when a tree was blown onto a mobile home in Levy County, the sheriff's office there said, after Debby made landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast earlier Monday as a Category One hurricane.\n\nAuthorities said a truck driver was killed after his 18-wheeler plunged into a canal in Hillsborough County, while a 38-year-old woman and 12-year-old boy died in a car crash in Dixie County.\n\nThe storm moved into Georgia overnight and is expected to go offshore before approaching the South Carolina coast on Thursday, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC).\n\n\"This is a level four out of four risk for excessive rainfall,\" Michael Brennan, director of the NHC, told reporters.\n\n\"This is going to result in a prolonged extreme rainfall event with potential for catastrophic flooding across coastal portions of Georgia, South Carolina, even extending up into North Carolina,\" he added.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis said that some 250,000 residents in his state were without power.\n\n\"Please, be very cautious when you're going out,\" he said, adding that Debby's winds had not been as damaging as previous hurricanes that have hit Florida.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has approved emergency declarations for Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, allowing for federal assistance in coordinating disaster relief efforts.\n\nDeSantis also activated his state's National Guard, with more than 3,000 service members mobilized to help with storm response.\n\n- Evacuation orders -\n\nBy Monday evening, the NHC said the storm was registering maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph) as it swept into Georgia.\n\nStorm surge warnings -- signalling a life-threatening inundation from rising water -- are in effect in parts of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.\n\nDebby was expected to bring \"potentially historic rainfall\" of up to 30 inches as it moved north, the NHC said.\n\nBut it said the storm was weakening after making landfall earlier with sustained speeds of 80 mph (130 kph) as a Category One hurricane -- the lowest on a scale of five.\n\nMandatory evacuations were ordered for part of Citrus County, Florida, with several other counties under voluntary evacuation orders, local media reported.\n\nThe governors of Georgia and South Carolina declared a state of emergency ahead of Debby's arrival.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris -- the Democratic candidate in the US election -- postponed events in North Carolina and Georgia this week due to the storm, according to local media reports citing her campaign team.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Border Patrol announced that Debby had washed up 25 packages of cocaine worth around $1 million to the coast of the Florida Keys, where they were seized.\n\nIn July, at least 18 people were killed when the powerful Hurricane Beryl tore through the Caribbean before hitting the southern US states of Texas and Louisiana.\n\nScientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of storms such as Beryl because there is more energy in a warmer ocean for them to feed on.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Verlyn Brock said the man died at the home in the city of Moultrie, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Valdosta, Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.\n\nThe storm has damaged roofs and downed power lines in Moultrie, Police Chief Chad Castleberry told WALB-TV.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Debby had top winds near 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening as it moved slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns eastward.\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, announces curfew, roads into historic city to be closed\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, officials announced a curfew starting at 11 p.m. Monday for the peninsula that makes up much of downtown and the older parts of the 350-year-old city as some of the heaviest rain from Tropical Storm Debby is expected to fall overnight.\n\nPolice will barricade all eight roads leading into the peninsula and only let essential workers and emergency personnel in or out. High-water vehicles will also be staged to go into the area as needed, Charleston Mayor William Cogswell said at a Monday evening news conference.\n\n\"We need people to make their way out. This is not something you can stay at the bar until 10:45. We need you to take this seriously,\" Cogswell said.\n\nThe mayor said forecasters told him 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain could fall in Charleston overnight.\n\nCity officials will assess the situation early Tuesday and decide how and when to reopen roads and lift the curfew.\n\nNo evacuations planned for now in South Carolina, officials say\n\nState officials don't plan any evacuations in South Carolina for now as Tropical Storm Debby slowly spins toward the state.\n\nLarge-scale evacuations typically bring people inland from the coast, and forecasters say Debby's biggest impacts could be as much as 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain in localized areas throughout the state, causing floodwaters to rise quickly in small areas. So any evacuations will up to local leaders.\n\n\"This storm may not have the high winds of a hurricane, but it has the potential to cause life-threatening floods across the state. And I would like to emphasize that Tropical Storm Debby is not just a coastal event, but it is a statewide event,\" state Emergency Management Division Director Kim Stenson said at a Monday afternoon news conference.\n\nBiden approves request from South Carolina's governor for emergency declaration\n\nThe White House said Monday that President Joe Biden has approved a request from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said personnel from the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard are deploying to the region and are prepared to support recovery efforts.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday ahead of Debby's anticipated rainfall. Flooding and power outages are expected to start Tuesday and continue through the rest of the week, according to North Carolina Emergency Management officials.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis previously had declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida's 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also had made his own emergency declaration.\n\nCurfew announced for Savannah and surrounding county as Debby approaches\n\nWith Debby's winds and rains expected to worsen overnight, officials for Savannah and surrounding Chatham County announced that an overnight curfew will take effect at 10 p.m. Monday and run to 6 a.m. Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nFlorida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.\n\nNo deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nMayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island: Don't let your guard down\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nIn saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nPackages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nDebby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nBiden briefed on Debby's progress\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nBig worry is storm surge from Debby\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nHundreds of thousands without power\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this.

"Tropical Storm Debby blew $1 million (\u00a3784,000) worth of cocaine onto the Florida Keys coast, US border patrol said.\n\nTwenty five packages washed up on a beach and were reported to police by a \"good Samaritan\", said Samuel Briggs, the acting chief patrol agent.\n\nHe did not give the location for the discovery but shared an image of the haul on X, which showed 25 bricks covered in a black rectangular sticker with a red triangular symbol on it.\n\nThe storm drenched Florida on Monday, killing at least four people and threatening south-eastern US states with heavy rainfall and catastrophic flooding.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died when a tree was blown onto a mobile home in Levy County, the sheriff's office said, after Debby made landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast early Monday as a category one hurricane.\n\nAuthorities said a truck driver was killed after his 18-wheeler plunged into a canal in Hillsborough County, while a 38-year-old woman and 12-year-old boy died in a car crash in Dixie County.\n\nThe storm moved into Georgia overnight on Monday and is expected to go offshore before approaching the South Carolina coast on Thursday, according to the National Hurricane Centre (NHC).\n\n\"This is a level four out of four risk for excessive rainfall,\" Michael Brennan, director of the NHC, told reporters.\n\n\"This is going to result in a prolonged extreme rainfall event with potential for catastrophic flooding across coastal portions of Georgia, South Carolina, even extending up into North Carolina,\" he added.\n\nRon DeSantis, the Florida governor, said that some 250,000 residents in his state were without power.\n\n\"Please, be very cautious when you're going out,\" he said, adding that Debby's winds had not been as damaging as previous hurricanes that have hit Florida.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has approved emergency declarations for Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, allowing for federal assistance in coordinating disaster relief efforts.\n\nMr DeSantis also activated his state's national guard, with more than 3,000 service members mobilised to help with the storm response.\n\nBy Monday evening, the NHC said the storm was registering maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph) as it swept into Georgia.\n\nStorm surge warnings - signalling a life-threatening inundation from rising water - are in effect in parts of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.\n\nDebby was expected to bring \"potentially historic rainfall\" of up to 30 inches as it moved north, the NHC said.\n\nBut it said the storm was weakening after making landfall earlier with sustained speeds of 80 mph (130 kph) as a category one hurricane - the lowest on a scale of five.\n\nMandatory evacuations were ordered for parts of Citrus County, Florida, with several other counties under voluntary evacuation orders, local media reported.\n\nThe governors of Georgia and South Carolina declared a state of emergency ahead of Debby's arrival.\n\nKamala Harris - the vice president and the Democratic candidate in the US election - postponed events in North Carolina and Georgia this week due to the storm, according to local media reports citing her campaign team.\n\nIn July, at least 18 people were killed when the powerful Hurricane Beryl tore through the Caribbean before hitting the southern US states of Texas and Louisiana.\n\nScientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of storms such as Beryl because there is more energy in a warmer ocean for them to feed on.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

In Sarasota, around 500 people were rescued from flooded houses, and in Manatee County, nearly 200 more needed to be rescued from floodwaters.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said on social media.\n\nOver 200,000 homes were left without power as of 11 a.m. local time on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us\n\nFive deaths have been reported from the storm so far, including a 13-year-old boy in Levy County, Florida and a 19-year-old man in Georgia who had trees fall onto their homes. A 64-year-old truck driver from Mississippi died when his vehicle fell into a canal in Hillsborough County and a 38-year-old woman and 12-year-old boy died in a car crash in Dixie County.\n\n\"In portions of Florida where Debby has passed, deadly hazards remain, including downed power lines and flooded areas. Ensure generators are properly ventilated to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. Exercise caution when using chainsaws and power tools, and drink plenty of water to avoid heat exhaustion,\" the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said in a Forecast Discussion early on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe NASA image of the hurricane hitting Florida was snapped by the ABI (Advanced Baseline Imager) on the NOAA GOES-16 (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-16) at about 3 a.m. Eastern Time, roughly four hours before Debby made landfall.\n\nThe storm, which currently has wind speeds of about 45 mph, is expected to move slightly off the Georgia coast later today, possibly intensifying over the ocean, before moving back over South Carolina on Thursday, traveling up the East Coast.\n\n\"Potentially historic heavy rainfall across southeast Georgia and eastern South Carolina through Friday will likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding,\" the NHC said. \"Heavy rainfall will likely result in flooding impacts from northern North Carolina through portions of Mid-Atlantic States and southern New England through Sunday Morning.\"\n\n\"Rainfall totals of 10 to 20 inches, with maximum amounts of 25 inches\" are being forecast for certain regions of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina later this week, potentially causing disastrous flash flooding. Additionally, coastal communities are at risk from storm surges caused by intense winds.\n\n\"Dangerous storm surge and tropical storm conditions will spread northward along the southeast U.S. coast from northeastern Florida to North Carolina through the middle of the week,\" the NHC said. \"Storm surge and tropical storm watches and warnings have been issued for portions of these areas. Residents in the storm surge watch and warning area should follow any advice given by local officials.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors":

Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said personnel from the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard are deploying to the region and are prepared to support recovery efforts.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday ahead of Debby's anticipated rainfall. Flooding and power outages are expected to start Tuesday and continue through the rest of the week, according to North Carolina Emergency Management officials.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis previously had declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida's 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also had made his own emergency declaration.\n\nCurfew announced for Savannah and surrounding county as Debby approaches\n\nWith Debby's winds and rains expected to worsen overnight, officials for Savannah and surrounding Chatham County announced that an overnight curfew will take effect at 10 p.m. Monday and run to 6 a.m. Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nFlorida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.\n\nNo deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nMayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island: Don't let your guard down\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nIn saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nPackages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nDebby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nBiden briefed on Debby's progress\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 50 mph (85 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was near the Florida-Georgia border and was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to decrease in speed as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nBig worry is storm surge from Debby\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nHundreds of thousands without power\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\n-- -\n\nThis version corrects the attribution for power outage figures to PowerOutage.us, not PowerOutage.com.", "source": {"uri":

Savannah Mayor Van Johnson told residents to expect a rough day Tuesday. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, which is based on wind speeds, meteorologists say it's the storm's rainfall capacity that makes it extremely dangerous.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nDebby has weakened over land because tropical cyclones derive their energy from warm water, but part of the circulation was still interacting Tuesday with water over the Atlantic, said Richard Pasch, a senior hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe storm\u00b4s center is expected to move out over the water off the Georgia and South Carolina coast, then move back inland, so it could restrengthen, but it\u00b4s not clear how much, he said.\n\nA pedestrian walks past a sign on a flooded street after heavy rain from Tropical Storm Debby, Monday, Aug. 5, 2024, in Savannah, Ga. (AP Photo/Stephen B. Morton)\n\nTropical storm warnings were posted from northeastern Florida up into North Carolina, and very heavy rain is expected, leading to catastrophic flooding across parts of southeastern Georgia, the eastern half of South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina through Friday, he said.\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they\u00b4re moving, you know, it doesn\u00b4t accumulate that much in one place,\" he said. \"But when they move very slowly, that\u00b4s the worst situation.\"\n\nDebby's center was over southeastern Georgia early Tuesday with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (75 kph), and it was moving northeast near 7 mph (11 kph). The center is expected to move off Georgia\u00b4s coast later Tuesday. Some strengthening is forecast on Wednesday and Thursday as Debby drifts offshore, before it moves inland over South Carolina on Thursday.\n\nThe emergency plan in the city of Charleston, South Carolina, includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters, and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed by flooding.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said Monday in a social media post.\n\n\"Essentially we\u00b4ve had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said in a social media update.\n\nJust north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"We are facing an unprecedented weather event with Hurricane Debby,\" said Jodie Fiske, Manatee County's public safety director. \"The safety of our residents is our top priority, and we are doing everything in our power to respond effectively to this crisis.\"\n\nHeavy winds and rain associated with Debby toppled a large tree onto a porch at a home in south Georgia, killing a 19-year-old man, authorities said Monday.\n\nColquitt County Coroner C. Verlyn Brock said the man died at the home in the city of Moultrie, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Valdosta, Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.\n\nThe storm has damaged roofs and downed power lines in Moultrie, Police Chief Chad Castleberry told WALB-TV.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Debby had top winds near 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening as it moved slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns eastward.\n\nThe driver of a stranded vehicle pushes his van out of a flooded street after heavy rain from Tropical Storm Debby, Monday, Aug. 5, 2024, in Savannah, Ga.

The National Hurricane Center said that Debby was downgraded at 11 a.m. on Monday to a tropical storm, but its affects still continue to ravage the state as it moves inland with flooding rain, damaging winds and a life-threatening storm surge.\n\nDebby, which made landfall as a Category 1 storm, touched down near Steinhatchee about 7 a.m. ET with winds estimated at 80 mph. After landfall, power outages skyrocketed to more than 300,000 utility customers in the Sunshine State, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nOfficials confirmed two deaths in Dixie County, Florida, as Debby approached the coastline: a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy, both from Crawfordville, were killed in a crash just before 9:30 p.m. Sunday on US Highway 19 after their car lost control and struck a guardrail. Additionally, a 13-year-old boy was also killed about 8 a.m. Monday after a tree fell on a mobile home in Levy County; and a fourth victim, a 64-year-old man from New Albany, Mississippi, died after the tractor-trailer he was driving on southbound Interstate 75 near the Tampa Bypass Canal lost control on the wet roadway, according to Florida State Troopers.\n\nForecasters continue to warn residents of life-threatening storm surges in Florida and major flooding across southeastern states, with downpours and flooding hitting Florida's Gulf Coast hard, with more than 10 inches of rain in some areas. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 61 counties expected to be affected by the storm. In a statement, his office said that 3,000 National Guard members have been mobilized.\n\nThe slow-moving storm is expected to dump extreme amounts of nearly 2 feet of rain on parts of Georgia and South Carolina by mid-week, with the National Hurricane Center is forecasting \"potentially historic rainfall\" across southeastern Georgia and South Carolina through Friday, causing widespread flash flooding and life-threatening conditions.\n\nGovernors in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina have all declared a state of emergency, and DeSantis shared in a statement: \"I think what's going to make this much different than what we had with Idalia is it is going to move very slowly once it enters Florida - it's going to be southern Georgia, northern Florida - and it is just going to drop an inordinate amount of water on the north-central Florida region.\"\n\nEditorial credit: BEST-BACKGROUNDS / Shutterstock.com", "source": {"uri": "ktts.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTTS"},

In Sarasota, around 500 people were rescued from flooded houses, and in Manatee County, nearly 200 more needed to be rescued from floodwaters.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said on social media.\n\nOver 200,000 homes were left without power as of 11 a.m. local time on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us\n\nMore From Newsweek Vault:What Is an Emergency Fund?\n\nFive deaths have been reported from the storm so far, including a 13-year-old boy in Levy County, Florida and a 19-year-old man in Georgia who had trees fall onto their homes. A 64-year-old truck driver from Mississippi died when his vehicle fell into a canal in Hillsborough County and a 38-year-old woman and 12-year-old boy died in a car crash in Dixie County.\n\n\"In portions of Florida where Debby has passed, deadly hazards remain, including downed power lines and flooded areas. Ensure generators are properly ventilated to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. Exercise caution when using chainsaws and power tools, and drink plenty of water to avoid heat exhaustion,\" the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said in a Forecast Discussion early on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe NASA image of the hurricane hitting Florida was snapped by the ABI (Advanced Baseline Imager) on the NOAA GOES-16 (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-16) at about 3 a.m. Eastern Time, roughly four hours before Debby made landfall.\n\nThe storm, which currently has wind speeds of about 45 mph, is expected to move slightly off the Georgia coast later today, possibly intensifying over the ocean, before moving back over South Carolina on Thursday, traveling up the East Coast.\n\n\"Potentially historic heavy rainfall across southeast Georgia and eastern South Carolina through Friday will likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding,\" the NHC said. \"Heavy rainfall will likely result in flooding impacts from northern North Carolina through portions of Mid-Atlantic States and southern New England through Sunday Morning.\"\n\n\"Rainfall totals of 10 to 20 inches, with maximum amounts of 25 inches\" are being forecast for certain regions of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina later this week, potentially causing disastrous flash flooding. Additionally, coastal communities are at risk from storm surges caused by intense winds.\n\n\"Dangerous storm surge and tropical storm conditions will spread northward along the southeast U.S. coast from northeastern Florida to North Carolina through the middle of the week,\" the NHC said. \"Storm surge and tropical storm watches and warnings have been issued for portions of these areas.

In Sarasota, a city in Florida, approximately 500 residents were evacuated as Phillippi Creek overflowed.\n\nManatee County, FL, has reported 58 water rescues, resulting in 207 people being brought to safety, county officials announced.\n\n\"We are facing an unprecedented weather event with Hurricane Debby,\" Manatee County's public safety director Jodie Fiske said in a statement.\n\n\"The safety of our residents is our top priority, and we are doing everything in our power to respond effectively to this crisis. I commend the heroic efforts of our emergency responders and the resilience of our community during this challenging time.\"\n\nThe Hurricane Center predicts a storm surge of up to four feet along the Georgia and Carolina coasts by midweek as Debby moves offshore.\n\nGovernors in these states have declared emergencies, and officials in cities such as Savannah, GA, and Charleston, SC, have imposed curfews to keep residents off flooded streets overnight.\n\nDebby is the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. The season is expected to see 17 to 25 named storms before ending in late fall. The storm has also led to widespread power outages. More than 140,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia, according to the tracking website poweroutage.us.\n\nIn July, Hurricane Beryl became the earliest recorded Category 5 hurricane, later striking Texas as a Category 1 storm, causing at least 23 deaths and widespread power outages.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times"},

plunged into a canal in Hillsborough County, while a 38-year-old woman and 12-year-old boy died in a car crash in Dixie County.\n\nThe storm is expected to move into Georgia overnight, before moving

director of the NHC, told reporters.\n\n\"This is going to result in a prolonged extreme rainfall event with potential for catastrophic flooding across coastal portions of Georgia, South Carolina, even extending up into North Carolina,\" he added.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis said that some 250,000 residents in his state were without power.\n\n\"Please, be very cautious when you're going out,\" he said, adding that Debby's winds had not been as damaging as previous hurricanes that have hit Florida.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Sunday approved an emergency declaration for Florida, allowing federal aid to be expedited.\n\nDeSantis has activated the state's National Guard, with more than 3,000 service members mobilized to help with storm response.\n\nBy late afternoon, the NHC said the storm was registering maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph) as it swept over Florida.\n\nStorm surge warnings -- signalling a life-threatening inundation from rising water -- are in effect in parts of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.\n\nDebby was expected to bring \"potentially historic rainfall\" of up to 30 inches as it moved north, the NHC said.\n\nBut it said Debby was weakening after making landfall earlier with sustained speeds of 80 mph (130 kph) as a Category One hurricane -- the lowest on a scale of five.\n\nMandatory evacuations were ordered for part of Citrus County, Florida, with eight other counties under voluntary evacuation orders, local media reported.\n\nPolice in the city of Sarasota said that some 500 residents were evacuated from their flooded homes.\n\nThe governors of Georgia and South Carolina have declared a state of emergency ahead of the storm's arrival.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Border Patrol announced that Debby had washed up 25 packages of cocaine to the coast of the Florida Keys, where they were seized.\n\nThe intended shipment had a street value of more than $1 million, acting chief patrol Agent Samuel Briggs II said on X.\n\nIn July, at least 18 people were killed when the powerful Hurricane Beryl tore through the Caribbean before hitting the southern US states of Texas and Louisiana.\n\nScientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of storms such as Beryl because there is more energy in a warmer ocean for them to feed on.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news",

Both Savannah and Charleston announced curfews Monday night into Tuesday.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County interim emergency director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday.\n\nIn addition to the curfew, the city of Charleston's emergency plan includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding.\n\nIn South Carolina a tornado touched down on Monday night, damaging trees, and homes and taking down power lines, the Colleton County Sheriff's Office said on social media. No injuries were immediately reported, officials said.\n\nThe National Weather Service continued issuing tornado warnings well into Monday night for parts of the state including in the island town of Hilton Head.\n\nDebby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It has weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, drenching and bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across portions of eastern Georgia, the coastal plain of South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Wednesday.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued on Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said in a social media post. Just north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County fire chief David Rathbun said on social media.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis warned that the state could continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" he said. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nFive people had died due to the storm as of Monday night, including a truck driver on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor-trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nSheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 metres) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died on Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office. In Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night.\n\nIn southern Georgia, a 19-year-old man died when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n\nNearly 160,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday night, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved a request from South Carolina's governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said he has asked Mr Biden to issue a pre-emptive federal emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to the state.\n\nNorth Carolina is also under a state of

(Scripps News)\n\nTropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with torrential rain and high winds, contributing to at least four deaths as it turned menacingly toward the Eastern Seaboard's low-lying regions and threatened to flood some of America's most historic Southern cities.\n\nHere's what to expect as the storm moves inland.\n\nWHERE DID TROPICAL STORM DEBBY MAKE LANDFALL?\n\nDebby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It has since weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, covering roads with water and contributing to at least four deaths.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It's not far from where Hurricane Idalia made landfall less than a year ago as a Category 3 storm.\n\nWHAT DAMAGE IS EXPECTED?\n\nRecord-setting rain was expected to cause flash flooding, with up to 30 inches possible in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said. The potential for high water threatened Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina. Up to 18 inches was forecast in central and north Florida.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because the storm is moving into Georgia, it doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" he said during an afternoon briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nMore than 300,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nGET THE UPDATED WEATHER FORECAST FROM THE TIMES-DISPATCH\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE CAROLINAS?\n\nSome of the heaviest rains could come along the Atlantic Coast from Jacksonville, Florida, through coastal regions of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.\n\n\"We could see a stall or a meandering motion around coastal portions of the southeastern United States,\" National Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan said in a Saturday briefing. \"So that's going to exacerbate not just the rainfall risk, but also the potential for storm surge and some strong winds.\"\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, officials announced a curfew starting at 11 p.m. Monday for the peninsula that makes up much of downtown and the older parts of the 350-year-old city as some of the heaviest rain from Tropical Storm Debby is expected to fall overnight.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nPolice will barricade all eight roads leading into the peninsula and only let essential workers and emergency personnel in or out. High-water vehicles will also be staged to go into the area as needed, Charleston Mayor William Cogswell said at a Monday evening news conference.\n\nGov. Youngkin tells Virginia to prepare as Tropical Storm Debby threatens Southeast\n\nTropical Storm Debby is forecast to bring catastrophic flooding to Florida and potentially record-setting rain to Georgia and South Carolina as it moves over the southeastern United States.\n\n\"We need people to make their way out. This is not something you can stay at the bar until 10:45. We need you to take this seriously,\" Cogswell said.\n\nThe mayor said forecasters told him 10 to 12 inches of rain could fall in Charleston overnight.\n\nCity officials will assess the situation early Tuesday and decide how and when to reopen roads and lift the curfew.\n\nThe White House said Monday that President Joe Biden has approved a request from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday ahead of Debby's anticipated rainfall. Flooding and power outages are expected to start Tuesday and continue through the rest of the week, according to North Carolina Emergency Management officials.\n\nWHAT SHOULD WE EXPECT IN VIRGINIA?\n\nThe National Weather Service in Wakefield reports that impacts from Tropical Storm Debby could be seen in Virginia as early as Wednesday, potentially continuing into the weekend.\n\nThe weather service's most recent briefing stated uncertainty remains about what those impacts may look like. Heavy rainfall and flooding are likely primary threats. Additional potential impacts include increased chances for rip currents and gusty winds later this week, but it's too soon for specific timing. Current estimates have the storm's intensity at about 69 mph.\n\nHow strong Debby will get depends on how far over the Atlantic Ocean the system moves, and how long it remains over water.\n\nGov. Glenn Youngkin posted on social media Monday: \"As Tropical Storm Debby brings powerful wind and rain, I encourage all Virginians to be prepared for incoming weather & exercise caution. And THANK YOU to Virginia Task Force 1 & 2 who are answering the call to assist neighboring states. Together, we can weather this storm.\"\n\nThe weather service is forecasting showers likely Wednesday through Saturday.\n\nThe Associated Press and The Virginian-Pilot contributed to this report.\n\n17 photos of Richmond Department Stores from our archives", "source": {"uri": "richmond.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Richmond Times-Dispatch"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Verlyn Brock said the man died at the home in the city of Moultrie, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Valdosta, Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.\n\nThe storm has damaged roofs and downed power lines in Moultrie, Police Chief Chad Castleberry told WALB-TV.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Debby had top winds near 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening as it moved slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns eastward.\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, announces curfew, roads into historic city to be closed\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, officials announced a curfew starting at 11 p.m. Monday for the peninsula that makes up much of downtown and the older parts of the 350-year-old city as some of the heaviest rain from Tropical Storm Debby is expected to fall overnight.\n\nPolice will barricade all eight roads leading into the peninsula and only let essential workers and emergency personnel in or out. High-water vehicles will also be staged to go into the area as needed, Charleston Mayor William Cogswell said at a Monday evening news conference.\n\n\"We need people to make their way out. This is not something you can stay at the bar until 10:45. We need you to take this seriously,\" Cogswell said.\n\nThe mayor said forecasters told him 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain could fall in Charleston overnight.\n\nCity officials will assess the situation early Tuesday and decide how and when to reopen roads and lift the curfew.\n\nNo evacuations planned for now in South Carolina, officials say\n\nState officials don't plan any evacuations in South Carolina for now as Tropical Storm Debby slowly spins toward the state.\n\nLarge-scale evacuations typically bring people inland from the coast, and forecasters say Debby's biggest impacts could be as much as 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain in localized areas throughout the state, causing floodwaters to rise quickly in small areas. So any evacuations will up to local leaders.\n\n\"This storm may not have the high winds of a hurricane, but it has the potential to cause life-threatening floods across the state. And I would like to emphasize that Tropical Storm Debby is not just a coastal event, but it is a statewide event,\" state Emergency Management Division Director Kim Stenson said at a Monday afternoon news conference.\n\nBiden approves request from South Carolina's governor for emergency declaration\n\nThe White House said Monday that President Joe Biden has approved a request from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said personnel from the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard are deploying to the region and are prepared to support recovery efforts.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday ahead of Debby's anticipated rainfall. Flooding and power outages are expected to start Tuesday and continue through the rest of the week, according to North Carolina Emergency Management officials.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis previously had declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida's 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also had made his own emergency declaration.\n\nCurfew announced for Savannah and surrounding county as Debby approaches\n\nWith Debby's winds and rains expected to worsen overnight, officials for Savannah and surrounding Chatham County announced that an overnight curfew will take effect at 10 p.m. Monday and run to 6 a.m. Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nFlorida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.\n\nNo deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nMayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island: Don't let your guard down\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nIn saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nPackages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nDebby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nBiden briefed on Debby's progress\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nBig worry is storm surge from Debby\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nHundreds of thousands without power\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\n-- -\n\nThis version corrects the attribution for power outage figures to PowerOutage.us, not PowerOutage.com.", "source": {"uri":

The storm, which initially made landfall as a Category One hurricane, brought torrential rains and powerful winds, leading to fatalities and severe damage.\n\nA 13-year-old boy in Levy County died when a tree was blown onto a mobile home. In Hillsborough County, a truck driver was killed after his 18-wheeler plunged into a canal. Additionally, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash in Dixie County, highlighting the deadly impact of the storm on local communities.\n\nRead More: Hailstorm damages cockpit, nose of Austrian Airlines flight mid-air\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis reported that around 250,000 residents were without power due to the storm. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for parts of Citrus County, and several other counties were under voluntary evacuation orders. The Florida National Guard was activated, with over 3,000 service members mobilized to assist in the storm response efforts.\n\nAfter making landfall, Debby moved into Georgia overnight and is expected to approach the South Carolina coast by Thursday. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned of \"potentially historic rainfall\" with the potential for catastrophic flooding in coastal regions of Georgia, South Carolina, and even extending into North Carolina.\n\n\"This is a level four out of four risk for excessive rainfall,\" said Michael Brennan, director of the NHC. \"This is going to result in a prolonged extreme rainfall event with potential for catastrophic flooding.\"\n\nIn response to the storm, President Joe Biden approved emergency declarations for Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, allowing federal aid to be expedited for disaster relief efforts. Governors of Georgia and South Carolina have also declared states of emergency ahead of Debby's arrival.\n\nThe storm has brought not only heavy rainfall but also severe weather conditions, including tornadoes. An apparent tornado touched down on Edisto Beach, South Carolina, causing significant damage. Other beach destinations such as Kiawah Island and Johns Island were also warned of possible tornado activity.\n\nStorm surge warnings are in effect for parts of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, signalling life-threatening inundation from rising water. The NHC predicted that Debby could bring up to 30 inches of rainfall in some areas, exacerbating the risk of catastrophic flooding.\n\nThe impact of Debby has led to widespread disruptions, including travel chaos. More than 1,700 flights were canceled, and numerous airports, including those in Tallahassee and Gainesville, were closed. Authorities have urged residents to remain indoors and avoid travel due to the hazardous conditions.\n\nScientists suggest that climate change may be contributing to the rapid intensification of storms like Debby. Warmer ocean temperatures provide more energy for storms to feed on, leading to more severe weather events. In July, the powerful Hurricane Beryl, which claimed at least 18 lives, showcased similar intensification patterns.\n\nRead More: Greece choked by Sahara sandstorm\n\nIn a surprising twist, the US Border Patrol reported that Debby had washed up 25 packages of cocaine worth around $1 million to the coast of the Florida Keys, which were subsequently seized.", "source": {"uri":

Savannah Mayor Van Johnson told residents to expect a rough day Tuesday. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, which is based on wind speeds, meteorologists say it's the storm's rainfall capacity that makes it extremely dangerous.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nDebby still getting energy from ocean water, expert says\n\nDebby has weakened over land because tropical cyclones derive their energy from warm water, but part of the circulation was still interacting Tuesday with water over the Atlantic, said Richard Pasch, a senior hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe storm's center is expected to move out over the water off the Georgia and South Carolina coast, then move back inland, so it could restrengthen, but it's not clear how much, he said.\n\nTropical storm warnings were posted from northeastern Florida up into North Carolina, and very heavy rain is expected, leading to catastrophic flooding across parts of southeastern Georgia, the eastern half of South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina through Friday, he said.\n\n\"Tropical cyclones always produce heavy rain, but normally as they're moving, you know, it doesn't accumulate that much in one place,\" he said. \"But when they move very slowly, that's the worst situation.\"\n\nCharleston ready with sandbags, parking garages\n\nDebby's center was over southeastern Georgia early Tuesday with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (75 kph), and it was moving northeast near 7 mph (11 kph). The center is expected to move off Georgia's coast later Tuesday. Some strengthening is forecast on Wednesday and Thursday as Debby drifts offshore, before it moves inland over South Carolina on Thursday.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe emergency plan in the city of Charleston, South Carolina, includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters, and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed by flooding.\n\nHundreds rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, area, officials say\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said Monday in a social media post.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said in a social media update.\n\nJust north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"We are facing an unprecedented weather event with Hurricane Debby,\" said Jodie Fiske, Manatee County's public safety director. \"The safety of our residents is our top priority, and we are doing everything in our power to respond effectively to this crisis.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMan killed when storm topples large tree onto home in south Georgia, officials say\n\nHeavy winds and rain associated with Debby toppled a large tree onto a porch at a home in south Georgia, killing a 19-year-old man, authorities said Monday.\n\nColquitt County Coroner C. Verlyn Brock said the man died at the home in the city of Moultrie, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Valdosta, Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.\n\nThe storm has damaged roofs and downed power lines in Moultrie, Police Chief Chad Castleberry told WALB-TV.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Debby had top winds near 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening as it moved slowly to the northeast.

Hundreds were evacuated from coastal communities as storm surge pushed several feet of water inland, overtaking cars and triggering water rescues.\n\nDebby is a large and slow-moving storm, making the system particularly dangerous as record amounts of rain inundate many areas, especially along the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina in the coming days.\n\nThe storm's center was forecast to move near Savannah on Tuesday night and drag along the South Carolina coast on Thursday night. \"Multiple days of very, very heavy rainfall\" are possible, National Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan said.\n\nThe National Weather Service estimates rainfall totals could reach up to 30 inches or more in isolated locations along the coast through Friday. The weather service office in Charleston, South Carolina, warned of \"potentially historic rainfall.\"\n\nAs Debby strengthened in the Gulf and drew closer to Florida, hurricane experts and scientists say it was a classic example of how the wind scale categories used to describe hurricanes can fall short of telling the whole story.\n\n\"This is another example of a storm where the primary impacts are going to be from water, rather than wind,\" said James Franklin, a retired branch chief of the hurricane specialist unit at the National Hurricane Center.\n\nJennifer Collins, a professor in the Geosciences School at the University of South Florida, has studied how to better communicate all of a storm's threats.\n\nLooking at the forecasts for up to 30 inches of rain in isolated locations between Savannah and Charleston, Collins told USA TODAY she's very concerned about the likelihood of \"catastrophic flooding\" and hopes people will look at all of the hurricane center's forecast products.

We need you to take this seriously,\" Cogswell said.\n\nThe mayor said forecasters told him 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain could fall in Charleston overnight.\n\nCity officials will assess the situation early Tuesday and decide how and when to reopen roads and lift the curfew.\n\nNo evacuations planned for now in South Carolina, officials say\n\nState officials don't plan any evacuations in South Carolina for now as Tropical Storm Debby slowly spins toward the state.\n\nLarge-scale evacuations typically bring people inland from the coast, and forecasters say Debby's biggest impacts could be as much as 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain in localized areas throughout the state, causing floodwaters to rise quickly in small areas. So any evacuations will up to local leaders.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"This storm may not have the high winds of a hurricane, but it has the potential to cause life-threatening floods across the state. And I would like to emphasize that Tropical Storm Debby is not just a coastal event, but it is a statewide event,\" state Emergency Management Division Director Kim Stenson said at a Monday afternoon news conference.\n\nBiden approves request from South Carolina's governor for emergency declaration\n\nThe White House said Monday that President Joe Biden has approved a request from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said personnel from the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard are deploying to the region and are prepared to support recovery efforts.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday ahead of Debby's anticipated rainfall. Flooding and power outages are expected to start Tuesday and continue through the rest of the week, according to North Carolina Emergency Management officials.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis previously had declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida's 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also had made his own emergency declaration.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nCurfew announced for Savannah and surrounding county as Debby approaches\n\nWith Debby's winds and rains expected to worsen overnight, officials for Savannah and surrounding Chatham County announced that an overnight curfew will take effect at 10 p.m. Monday and run to 6 a.m. Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nFlorida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.\n\nNo deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nMayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island: Don't let your guard down\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nIn saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nPackages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nDebby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBiden briefed on Debby's progress\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 50 mph (85 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was near the Florida-Georgia border and was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to decrease in speed as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nBig worry is storm surge from Debby\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nHundreds of thousands without power\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\n-- -\n\nThis version corrects the attribution for power outage figures to PowerOutage.us, not PowerOutage.com.", "source": {"uri":

Hurricane Debby made landfall early this morning.\n\nBy JEFF MARTIN and CHRISTOPHER O'MEARA - Associated Press\n\nHORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with catastrophic flooding and was blamed for at least four deaths, with Georgia and South Carolina next in line as the system rips across the southeastern United States.\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina, and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said. Debby had made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over the gulf coast of Florida.\n\nThe tropical storm was moving slowly across Florida, covering roads with water and contributing to at least four deaths.\n\nA truck driver died on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nAnd in Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night. The Florida Highway Patrol said a 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries.\n\nMore than 300,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up.\"\n\nAirports were also affected. More than 1,600 flights had been canceled nationwide; many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday. Nearly 30% of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport were canceled.\n\nSarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, was one of the hardest-hit by flooding.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" said Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun in a social media update.\n\nThe storm made landfall early Monday morning near Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nTaylor County, where Steinhatchee is located, closed several roads due to flooding, Sheriff Wayne Padgett said. Trees and power lines had also fallen across some roads. Padgett advised anyone who evacuated from low-lying or coastal areas to wait before returning to their homes because the tide had not come in, and it was unclear how deep flood waters might get later.\n\nLooking out over the Steinhatchee River from the condo above the marina he operates, Chris Williams said he was feeling blessed that the damage wasn't worse. Williams said his power went out at about 5:30 a.m. Monday as the storm was washing ashore, jamming the dock-studded riverfront with tree debris and barrels.\n\nThe small community is roughly 20 miles (32 kilometers) from where Hurricane Idalia crashed ashore less than a year ago.\n\n\"Two in less than a year is pretty bad,\" Williams said. \"You do everything you can possibly do to prepare. And when you've done that, clean up and put it back together and move forward.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has postponed a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby. Harris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nOn Monday, local leaders in Savannah said flooding could happen in areas that don't usually get high water if Debby stalls out over the city.\n\n\"This type of rain hovering over us, coming with the intensity that they tell us it is coming, it's going to catch a whole lot of people by surprise,\" said Chatham County Chairman Chester Ellis.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.\n\nThe city of Charleston has an emergency plan in place that includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding.\n\nIn 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.\n\nIn Savannah, Jim Froncak piled sandbags into his pickup truck on Monday, as rain was already falling.

The storm brought severe flooding and high winds to the state, where Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) declared a state of emergency in 61 counties.\n\nIt downgraded to a tropical storm by 11 a.m., according to the governor's office. The storm is now slated to move across Georgia and South Carolina in the coming days.\n\n\"Potentially historic heavy rainfall across southeast Georgia and the coastal plain of South Carolina through Saturday morning will likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding,\" the National Hurricane Center said in its forecast.\n\n\"Heavy rainfall will likely result in considerable flooding impacts from portions of central and northern Florida and across portions of central and northeast North Carolina through Saturday morning,\" the forecast said.\n\nThe forecasters also noted that hazards remain in areas where the storm has already passed, including downed power lines and flooded areas. According to poweroutage.us, more than 162,000 customers are without power in Florida as of Monday evening. More than 27,000 customers reported power outages in Georgia.\n\nCNN reported that at least four people have died from the storm in Florida, including a 13-year-old boy who was killed after a tree fell onto his home in Levy County.\n\n\"As Tropical Storm Debby passes, stay safe and avoid driving if you are in an impacted area.

"Coastal South Carolina and Georgia were under flash flood warnings Tuesday, as Tropical Storm Debby swamped the southeastern United States, leaving at least five dead.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died when a tree was blown onto a mobile home in Levy County, the sheriff's office there said, after Debby made landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast earlier Monday as a Category One hurricane.\n\nAuthorities said a truck driver was killed after his 18-wheeler plunged into a canal in Hillsborough County, while a 38-year-old woman and 12-year-old boy died in a car crash in Dixie County.\n\nAs the storm moved northward into Georgia, a 19-year-old was killed when a tree fell into the side of a house, according to the Colquitt County coroner's office.\n\nEarly Tuesday morning, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) was warning of \"potentially historic heavy rainfall\" and \"catastrophic flooding\" in parts of southeast Georgia and eastern South Carolina.\n\nThe Weather Channel reported tornadoes in South Carolina overnight.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has approved emergency declarations for Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, allowing for federal assistance in coordinating disaster relief efforts.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis also activated his state's National Guard, with more than 3,000 service members mobilized to help with storm response.\n\nThe governors of Georgia and South Carolina declared a state of emergency ahead of Debby's arrival.\n\nBy Tuesday morning, the NHC said the storm was registering maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph) as it swept through Georgia, expected to later move offshore.\n\nThe storm is set to move along the East Coast, but has already weakened after making initial landfall with sustained speeds of 80 mph (130 kph) as a Category One hurricane -- the lowest on a scale of five.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris -- the Democratic candidate in the US presidential election -- postponed events in North Carolina and Georgia this week due to the storm, according to local media reports and her campaign team.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Border Patrol announced that Debby had washed up 25 packages of cocaine worth around $1 million to the coast of the Florida Keys, where they were seized.\n\nIn July, at least 18 people were killed when the powerful Hurricane Beryl tore through the Caribbean before hitting the southern US states of Texas and Louisiana.\n\nScientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of storms such as Beryl because there is more energy in a warmer ocean for them to feed on.", "source":

The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 50 mph (85 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was near the Florida-Georgia border and was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to decrease in speed as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\n-- -\n\nThis version corrects the attribution for power outage figures to PowerOutage.us, not PowerOutage.com.", "source": {"uri":

It takes winds of 75 mph and above for a storm to be classified as a hurricane.\n\nWithin the next few days, Debby is expected to move upward along the Southeast, bringing with it the potential for heavy rainfall and major flooding. To prepare residents, the NOAA has issued a high risk -- it's highest level of flood outlook.\n\nAccording to The Weather Channel, flooding from rainfall could intensify due to winds blowing onshore along the Southeast coast. In turn, this may prevent floodwaters from draining towards the ocean. Other risks posed by Debby include strong wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes.\n\nHere's what to know as the tropical storm travels to S.C.\n\nAt 2 p.m. Aug. 5, Debby was currently tracking inland in northern Florida and southern Georgia, with heavy rainfall extending from the Florida Peninsula to southern Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nA tornado watch is in effect until 4 p.m. for northern and central Florida, as well as southeast Georgia.\n\nMore: Jim Cantore is in Charleston: That's not a good sign ahead of historic flooding forecast\n\nIn the Big Bend region, rainfall totaled 5 to 10 inches, according to The Weather Channel. Wind gusts of 60 mph were also reported, with a top gust of 70 mph near Mayo. Over in Cedar Key, a water rise of 6 feet above normal was observed, causing moderate coastal flooding. More than a foot of rainfall was reported in various spots in west-central Florida.\n\nDebby will now track northeast, heading toward southern Georgia and stalling before moving through the Southeast coast over the week, according to the National Hurricane Center. Serious impacts from the storm slowing down regard rainfall flooding. Since 2013, flooding was accountable for the majority of direct U.S. deaths from tropical storms and hurricanes, per a 2023 National Hurricane Center study.\n\nPortions of southeast Georgia, the S.C. coastal plain, and southeast North Carolina are expected to receive rainfall totals between 10 to 20 inches. Localized amounts may reach 30 inches through Saturday morning. According to the Hurricane Center's rainfall map, the area between Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston likely will have the heaviest impact.\n\n\"Potentially historic heavy rainfall across southeast Georgia and the coastal plain of South Carolina through Saturday morning will likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding,\" the Hurricane Center said.\n\nAccuWeather's statement was even stronger.\n\n\"Rainfall totals could surpass 30 inches in spots. I'm very concerned the Savannah, Charleston and Myrtle Beach areas could face catastrophic amounts of rainfall over the next few days, especially if Debby stalls for a longer amount of time than we expect,\" Alex DaSilva, AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert, said in a news release.\n\nParts of central and northern Florida and northeast North Carolina may have rainfall totals of 6 to 12 inches, and up to 18 inches locally.\n\nNOAA statistics indicate that half of deaths in floods occur in vehicles. For this reason, it is important to avoid driving through flooded areas or around barriers signaling a road closure.\n\nA flood watch remains in effect for the following areas in southeast Georgia as of 10:45 a.m.: Bulloch, Candler, Coastal Bryan, Coastal Chatham, Coastal Liberty, Coastal McIntosh, Effingham, Evans, Inland Bryan, Inland Chatham, Inland Liberty, Inland McIntosh, Jenkins, Long, Screven and Tattnall.\n\nIn southeast S.C., the following areas remain under a flood watch as of 10:45 a.m.: Allendale, Beaufort, Charleston, Coastal Colleton, Coastal Jasper, Dorchester, Hampton, Inland Berkeley, Inland Colleton, Inland Jasper and Tidal Berkeley.\n\nA tropical storm warning is in effect for the following areas as of 2p.m.: Florida coast from Indian Pass to Aripeka, St. Augustine, Florida to South Santee River, South Carolina.\n\nThe NOAA's tropical storm outlook states the center will move across southeastern Georgia tonight and Tuesday. By late Tuesday and Wednesday, the storm will move offshore of the SC coast.\n\n\u220e Monday-Monday night: northern and central Florida to southeast Georgia and southern South Carolina.\n\n\u220e Tuesday-Tuesday night: northeast Florida to eastern Georgia, middle and lower South Carolina and southern North Carolina. Lingering heavy rain might continue as far south as central Florida.\n\n\u220e Wednesday-Wednesday night: Southeast Georgia to middle and lower South Carolina, eastern North Carolina and southeast Virginia.\n\n\u220e Thursday-Friday: The threat of flooding rain might continue in parts of the Carolinas and Virginia, but details are uncertain.\n\nNina Tran covers trending topics for The Greenville News.

The governors of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina declared states of emergency in anticipation of Debby's damage.\n\nBy late afternoon on Monday, Debby had already dumped eight to 16 inches of rain in some parts of central Florida, according to local weather reports.\n\n\"This is going to be an event that is going to be probably here for the next five to seven days, maybe as long as 10 days, depending on how much rainfall we get,\" said Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management.\n\nOfficials in Georgia and South Carolina braced for flooding.\n\n\"It may be the most water we've seen in a long while,\" South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said at a briefing. \"There may be flooding in areas that never flooded in the past.\"\n\nSavannah Mayor Van Johnson said the city could expect a \"once in a thousand year\" rain event.\n\n\"This will literally create islands in the city,\" Johnson said.\n\nSLOW DRENCHING\n\nA slow-moving tropical storm as it passed over Cuba, Debby gained strength from exceptionally warm Gulf waters as it paralleled Florida's Gulf Coast on Sunday.\n\nDebby bears some of the hallmarks of Hurricane Harvey, which hit Corpus Christi, Texas, in August 2017. Downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved inland, Harvey lingered over Texas, dumping about 50 inches of rain on Houston and causing $125 billion in damage.\n\nClimate scientists believe man-made global warming from burning fossil fuels has raised the temperature of the oceans, making storms bigger and more devastating.\n\nThe last hurricane to make a direct hit on the Big Bend region was Hurricane Idalia, which briefly gained Category 4 strength before making landfall as a Category 3 in August 2023, with winds of more than 125mph. The National Centers for Environmental Information estimated $3.5 billion in damages. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis described the initial effects of Debby as \"modest\" compared with Idalia.\n\nForecasters expect numerous Atlantic hurricanes in the 2024 season, which began on June 1, including four to seven major ones. That would exceed the record-breaking 2005 season that spawned the devastating Katrina and Rita hurricanes.\n\nOnly one other hurricane, Beryl, has formed in the Atlantic this year. The earliest Category 5 storm on record, it struck the Caribbean and Mexico's Yucatan peninsula before rolling up the Gulf Coast of Texas as a Category 1 storm, with sustained winds up to 95mph.",

An alert for a 'danger of life-threatening storm surge' has also been issued and at least five people have been killed after the storm made landfall.\n\nInitially classed as a Category 1 hurricane when it hit land along the Gulf Coast of Florida early on Monday, it was weakened to a tropical storm but it's still bringing torrential rain along the East Coast. On Monday about 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said in a social media post. Just north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\nFive people had died due to the storm as of Monday night, including a truck driver on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor-trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 metres) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nREAD MORE: UK Foreign Office 'no travel list' of 34 countries where Brits are told 'stay away'\n\nA 13-year-old boy died on Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office. In Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night. In southern Georgia, a 19-year-old man died when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n\nIn South Carolina a tornado touched down on Monday night, damaging trees, and homes and taking down power lines, the Colleton County Sheriff's Office said on social media. No injuries were immediately reported, officials said. President Joe Biden approved a request from South Carolina's governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said he has asked Mr Biden to issue a pre-emptive federal emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to the state. North Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Governor Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed on Monday.\n\nIn an advisory published at 5am EDT on Tuesday August 6, the National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center issued warnings of the extreme weather conditions caused by tropical Storm Debby. The storm is travelling northwards but those in areas of Florida where it has passed are warned of 'deadly hazards' left in its wake.\n\nThe update said: \"Potentially historic heavy rainfall across southeast Georgia and eastern South Carolina through Friday will likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding.\" It warned of further flooding from North Carolina through portions of Mid-Atlantic States and southern New England through Sunday morning.\n\nIt added: \"Dangerous storm surge and tropical storm conditions will spread northward along the southeast US coast from northeastern Florida to North Carolina through the middle of the week. Storm surge and tropical storm watches and warnings have been issued for portions of these areas.\" Those in storm watch areas are urged to follow advice from local officials.\n\nWhile the storm moves northwards, the National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center said that people need to stay safe amid the storm damage. It said: \"In portions of Florida where Debby has passed, deadly hazards remain, including downed power lines and flood areas.\"\n\nThe National Storm Surge Unit at the National Hurricane Center issued an alert for a 'danger of life-threatening storm surge'. Posting on X the statement at 5am EDT said: \"There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge from #Debby along portions of the southeast U.S. coast from Altamaha Sound, GA to the South Santee River, SC, where a Storm Surge Warning is in effect. A Storm Surge Watch is also in effect from the South Santee River, SC to Cape Fear, NC. Residents in the Storm Surge Watch and Warning areas should follow any advice given by local officials.\"\n\nFor more of today's top stories, click here.", "source": {"uri":

Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 65 mph (100 kph). The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast, and was expected to decrease in speed as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia.\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"", "source": {"uri": "wishtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WISH-TV | Indianapolis News | Indiana Weather | Indiana Traffic"},

It takes winds of 75 mph and above for a storm to be classified as a hurricane.\n\nWithin the next few days, Debby is expected to move upward along the Southeast, bringing with it the potential for heavy rainfall and major flooding. To prepare residents, the NOAA has issued a high risk -- it's highest level of flood outlook.\n\nAccording to The Weather Channel, flooding from rainfall could intensify due to winds blowing onshore along the Southeast coast. In turn, this may prevent floodwaters from draining towards the ocean. Other risks posed by Debby include strong wind gusts, storm surge, and tornadoes.\n\nHere's what to know as the tropical storm travels to S.C.\n\nWhere is Debby now?\n\nAt 2 p.m. Aug. 5, Debby was currently tracking inland in northern Florida and southern Georgia, with heavy rainfall extending from the Florida Peninsula to southern Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nA tornado watch is in effect until 4 p.m. for northern and central Florida, as well as southeast Georgia.\n\nMore: Jim Cantore is in Charleston: That's not a good sign ahead of historic flooding forecast\n\nIn the Big Bend region, rainfall totaled 5 to 10 inches, according to The Weather Channel. Wind gusts of 60 mph were also reported, with a top gust of 70 mph near Mayo. Over in Cedar Key, a water rise of 6 feet above normal was observed, causing moderate coastal flooding. More than a foot of rainfall was reported in various spots in west-central Florida.\n\nWhere will Debby head next?\n\nDebby will now track northeast, heading toward southern Georgia and stalling before moving through the Southeast coast over the week, according to the National Hurricane Center. Serious impacts from the storm slowing down regard rainfall flooding. Since 2013, flooding was accountable for the majority of direct U.S. deaths from tropical storms and hurricanes, per a 2023 National Hurricane Center study.\n\nHow much rainfall will SC receive?\n\nPortions of southeast Georgia, the S.C. coastal plain, and southeast North Carolina are expected to receive rainfall totals between 10 to 20 inches. Localized amounts may reach 30 inches through Saturday morning. According to the Hurricane Center's rainfall map, the area between Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston likely will have the heaviest impact.\n\n\"Potentially historic heavy rainfall across southeast Georgia and the coastal plain of South Carolina through Saturday morning will likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding,\" the Hurricane Center said.\n\nParts of central and northern Florida and northeast North Carolina may have rainfall totals of 6 to 12 inches, and up to 18 inches locally.\n\nNOAA statistics indicate that half of deaths in floods occur in vehicles. For this reason, it is important to avoid driving through flooded areas or around barriers signaling a road closure.\n\nFlash flood watches and warnings for Georgia, SC\n\nA flood watch remains in effect for the following areas in southeast Georgia as of 10:45 a.m.: Bulloch, Candler, Coastal Bryan, Coastal Chatham, Coastal Liberty, Coastal McIntosh, Effingham, Evans, Inland Bryan, Inland Chatham, Inland Liberty, Inland McIntosh, Jenkins, Long, Screven and Tattnall.\n\nIn southeast S.C., the following areas remain under a flood watch as of 10:45 a.m.: Allendale, Beaufort, Charleston, Coastal Colleton, Coastal Jasper, Dorchester, Hampton, Inland Berkeley, Inland Colleton, Inland Jasper and Tidal Berkeley.\n\nTropical storm and surge warning in effect for Georgia, SC coast\n\nA tropical storm warning is in effect for the following areas as of 2p.m.: Florida coast from Indian Pass to Aripeka, St. Augustine, Florida to South Santee River, South Carolina.\n\nWhen will Debby be in SC?\n\nThe NOAA's tropical storm outlook states the center will move across southeastern Georgia tonight and Tuesday. By late Tuesday and Wednesday, the storm will move offshore of the SC coast.\n\nExcessive rain outlooks over the next few days, according to The Weather Channel\n\n\u220e Monday-Monday night: northern and central Florida to southeast Georgia and southern South Carolina.\n\n\u220e Tuesday-Tuesday night: northeast Florida to eastern Georgia, middle and lower South Carolina and southern North Carolina. Lingering heavy rain might continue as far south as central Florida.\n\n\u220e Wednesday-Wednesday night: Southeast Georgia to middle and lower South Carolina, eastern North Carolina and southeast Virginia.\n\n\u220e Thursday-Friday: The threat of flooding rain might continue in parts of the Carolinas and Virginia, but details are uncertain.", "source": {"uri": "greenvilleonline.com",

(WBTV) - A State of Emergency was activated in North Carolina Monday afternoon in anticipation of severe weather brought on by Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nThe emergency declaration was made the day before potentially historic rainfall, and subsequent flooding, was expected to reach the Carolinas. Tropical Storm Debby first touched down as a Category 1 Hurricane in Florida the morning of Monday, Aug. 5, and was forecast to slowly move north and east along the coast through the rest of the week.\n\nA State of Emergency was declared for South Carolina over the weekend.\n\nMore rain was expected in South Carolina this week than in North Carolina -- though both states could receive record-breaking amounts of rainfall between Tuesday, Aug. 6 and Saturday, Aug. 10. Tropical-storm-force winds were projected to reach North Carolina by Wednesday evening, according to the National Hurricane Center. State officials said wind gusts of up to 40 mph were possible in the state.\n\n\"The governor and NC Emergency Management officials are urging North Carolinians to be safe and cautious during heavy rainfall and winds, and to expect flooding and power outages as a strong weather system will impact the state starting Tuesday through the end of the week,\" a press release from the governor's office read Monday. \"Damaging winds and saturated soils might also lead to blown down trees and power lines, causing possible scattered to widespread power outages.\"\n\nFlash flooding and riverine flooding were possible in North Carolina this week. Communities along the southern North Carolina coast, including Wilmington, could receive as much as 12-16 inches of rain by Saturday. Much of the southeastern portion of the state was projected to see around 8-12 inches.\n\n\"Debby is expected to produce rainfall totals of 6 to 12 inches, with maximum amounts of 18 inches, across portions of central and northern Florida as well as central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning,\" the National Hurricane Center writes. \"This rainfall will likely result in areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, with significant river flooding expected.\"\n\nAreas a bit more north and west will likely see less rain. Charlotte, for example, could get around 4-6 inches of rain this week. Less rain is expected the further east you go.\n\nOur meteorologists have issued a First Alert for Thursday and Friday this week as Tropical Storm Debby crosses our area. Lighter rain is expected Tuesday in the Charlotte Metro, while heavier rain, flooding, and torrential downpours will become possible Wednesday and especially on Thursday. Heavy rain is still likely Friday, but may not be torrential.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center predicts that rain from Tropical Storm Debby will be heaviest along the South Carolina coast from Charleston to Savannah, Georgia. Areas between Charleston and Savannah could see 20-30 inches of rain by Saturday, Aug. 10.\n\nSouth Carolina communities west and north of the coast are also expected to receive a significant amount of rain in the coming days. Communities just outside Charleston could see 16-20 inches of rain, while those near the center of the state could see anywhere from 8-16 inches of rain.\n\n\"Across portions of southeast Georgia, the coastal plain of South Carolina, and southeast North Carolina, 10 to 20 inches of rainfall, with local amounts to 30 inches, are expected through Saturday morning. This potentially historic rainfall will likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding,\" according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nAccording to Kim Stenson, director of the South Carolina Emergency Management Division, the anticipated rainfall would set new records for the state. The many inches of rain could lead to flooding and flash flooding in the state.\n\n\"The heavy rains and flooding currently predicted this week are historic in scope and scale. Our experts with the National Hurricane Center believe flooding to be catastrophic for many parts of South Carolina,\" Stenson said in a statement Monday. \"Take no chances with this storm.\"\n\n---> Tropical Storm Debby may bring 'catastrophic' flooding to South Carolina amid 'multiday deluge'\n\nParts of western South Carolina should see less rain than the coast. About 1-4 inches of rain are possible for those furthest west, while the western-central portion of the state could receive 4-12 inches.\n\nNorth Carolina residents are urged to take the following steps, as shared by the governor's office Monday:", "source": {"uri": "wbtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://www.wbtv.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

was blown onto a mobile home in Levy County, the sheriff's office there said, after Debby made landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast earlier Monday as a Category One hurricane.\n\nAuthorities said a truck driver was killed after his 18-wheeler plunged into a canal in Hillsborough County, while a 38-year-old woman and 12-year-old boy died in a car crash in Dixie County.\n\nThe storm moved into Georgia overnight and is expected to go offshore before approaching the South Carolina coast on Thursday, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC).\n\n\"This is a level four out of four risk for excessive rainfall,\" Michael Brennan, director of the NHC, told reporters.\n\n\"This is going to result in a prolonged extreme rainfall event with potential for catastrophic flooding across coastal portions of Georgia, South Carolina, even extending up into North Carolina,\" he added.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis said that some 250,000 residents in his state were without power.\n\n\"Please, be very cautious when you're going out,\" he said, adding that Debby's winds had not been as damaging as previous hurricanes that have hit Florida.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has approved emergency declarations for Florida and South Carolina, allowing for federal assistance in coordinating disaster relief efforts.\n\nDeSantis also activated his state's National Guard, with more than 3,000 service members mobilized to help with storm response.\n\nBy Monday evening, the NHC said the storm was registering maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph) as it swept into Georgia.\n\nStorm surge warnings -- signalling a life-threatening inundation from rising water -- are in effect in parts of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.\n\nDebby was expected to bring \"potentially historic rainfall\" of up to 30 inches as it moved north, the NHC said.\n\nBut it said the storm was weakening after making landfall earlier with sustained speeds of 80 mph (130 kph) as a Category One hurricane -- the lowest on a scale of five.\n\nMandatory evacuations were ordered for part of Citrus County, Florida, with several other counties under voluntary evacuation orders, local media reported.\n\nThe governors of Georgia and South Carolina declared a state of emergency ahead of Debby's arrival.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris -- the Democratic candidate in the US election -- postponed events in North Carolina and Georgia this week due to the storm, according to local media reports citing her campaign team.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Border Patrol announced that Debby had washed up 25 packages of cocaine worth around $1 million to the coast of the Florida Keys, where they were seized.\n\nIn July, at least 18 people were killed when the powerful Hurricane Beryl tore through the Caribbean before hitting the southern US states of Texas and Louisiana.\n\nScientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of storms such as Beryl because there is more energy in a warmer ocean for them to feed on.", "source": {"uri": "terradaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Terra Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The governors of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina declared states of emergency in anticipation of Debby's damage.\n\nBy late afternoon on Monday, Debby had already dumped eight to 16 inches of rain in some parts of central Florida, according to local weather reports.\n\n\"This is going to be an event that is going to be probably here for the next five to seven days, maybe as long as 10 days, depending on how much rainfall we get,\" said Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management.\n\nOfficials in Georgia and South Carolina braced for flooding.\n\n\"It may be the most water we've seen in a long while,\" South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said at a briefing. \"There may be flooding in areas that never flooded in the past.\"\n\nSavannah Mayor Van Johnson said the city could expect a \"once in a thousand year\" rain event.\n\n\"This will literally create islands in the city,\" Johnson said.\n\nSLOW DRENCHING\n\nA slow-moving tropical storm as it passed over Cuba, Debby gained strength from exceptionally warm Gulf waters as it paralleled Florida's Gulf Coast on Sunday.\n\nDebby bears some of the hallmarks of Hurricane Harvey, which hit Corpus Christi, Texas, in August 2017. Downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved inland, Harvey lingered over Texas, dumping about 50 inches of rain on Houston and causing $125 billion in damage.\n\nClimate scientists believe man-made global warming from burning fossil fuels has raised the temperature of the oceans, making storms bigger and more devastating.\n\nThe last hurricane to make a direct hit on the Big Bend region was Hurricane Idalia, which briefly gained Category 4 strength before making landfall as a Category 3 in August 2023, with winds of more than 125 mph. The National Centers for Environmental Information estimated $3.5 billion in damages. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis described the initial effects of Debby as \"modest\" compared with Idalia.\n\nForecasters expect numerous Atlantic hurricanes in the 2024 season, which began on June 1, including four to seven major ones. That would exceed the record-breaking 2005 season that spawned the devastating Katrina and Rita hurricanes.\n\nOnly one other hurricane, Beryl, has formed in the Atlantic this year. The earliest Category 5 storm on record, it struck the Caribbean and Mexico's Yucatan peninsula before rolling up the Gulf Coast of Texas as a Category 1 storm, with sustained winds up to 95 mph.\n\n(Reporting by Rich McKay in Atlanta, Gabriella Borter in Washington, Andrew Hay in Taos, New Mexico, and Tyler Clifford in New York; Editing by David Gregorio and Stephen Coates)", "source":

County, while a 38-year-old woman and 12-year-old boy died in a car crash in Dixie County.\n\nThe storm is expected to move into Georgia overnight, before moving offshore and approaching the South Carolina coast on Thursday, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC).\n\n\"This is a level four out of four risk for excessive rainfall,\" Michael Brennan, director of the NHC, told reporters.\n\n\"This is going to result in a prolonged extreme rainfall event with potential for catastrophic flooding across coastal portions of Georgia, South Carolina, even extending up into North Carolina,\" he added.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis said that some 250,000 residents in his state were without power.\n\n\"Please, be very cautious when you're going out,\" he said, adding that Debby's winds had not been as damaging as previous hurricanes that have hit Florida.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Sunday approved an emergency declaration for Florida, allowing federal aid to be expedited.\n\nDeSantis has activated the state's National Guard, with more than 3,000 service members mobilized to help with storm response.\n\n- Evacuation orders -\n\nBy late afternoon, the NHC said the storm was registering maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph) as it swept over Florida.\n\nStorm surge warnings -- signalling a life-threatening inundation from rising water -- are in effect in parts of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.\n\nDebby was expected to bring \"potentially historic rainfall\" of up to 30 inches as it moved north, the NHC said.\n\nBut it said Debby was weakening after making landfall earlier with sustained speeds of 80 mph (130 kph) as a Category One hurricane -- the lowest on a scale of five.\n\nMandatory evacuations were ordered for part of Citrus County, Florida, with eight other counties under voluntary evacuation orders, local media reported.\n\nPolice in the city of Sarasota said that some 500 residents were evacuated from their flooded homes.\n\nThe governors of Georgia and South Carolina have declared a state of emergency ahead of the storm's arrival.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Border Patrol announced that Debby had washed up 25 packages of cocaine to the coast of the Florida Keys, where they were seized.\n\nThe intended shipment had a street value of more than $1 million, acting chief patrol Agent Samuel Briggs II said on X.\n\nIn July, at least 18 people were killed when the powerful Hurricane Beryl tore through the Caribbean before hitting the southern US states of Texas and Louisiana.\n\nScientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of storms such as Beryl because there is more energy in a warmer ocean for them to feed on.\n\nbur-ia/bjt/dw", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType":

Here's how much rain could fall. - The Boston Globe", "body": "But experts say the worst is yet to come as the storm system is expected to stall over the Southeast region.\n\nForecasters say the system could pummel the Southeast with widespread areas of up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain and some totaling up to 30 inches (76 centimeters).\n\nThat would be a record-setting rainfall, shattering the record from a tropical system in 2018's Hurricane Florence. More than 23 inches (58 centimeters) of rain was recorded in South Carolina after that storm hit the Carolinas.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, \"It really is worthy of a Category 3 or 4 rating, if you want to talk about rainfall impacts,\" said Jeff Masters, founder of Weather Underground, now with Yale Climate Connections. \"That's going to cause a lot of damage.\"\n\nNorthern Florida as well as low-lying areas including Savannah, Georgia, and Hilton Head Island and Charleston, South Carolina, are expected to see the most severe flooding. North Carolina could also be impacted.\n\nOfficials in Savannah warned the area could see a month's worth of rain in four days if the system stalls. There were also flooding concerns for Tybee Island, Georgia's largest public beach 18 miles (28.97 kilometers) east of Savannah. On top of any torrential downpours that Debby dishes out, the island could get even wetter from 2 to 4 feet of storm surge, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Hilton Head Island Mayor Alan Perry said on a video posted to Facebook. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.\n\nFew places in South Carolina are as susceptible to flooding as Charleston. Much of the city and surrounding areas founded in 1670 were built on land created by using fill dirt and other debris. Rising sea levels cause a number of minor flooding events even without a storm and like many coastal cities, Charleston can't drain well.\n\nThe city doesn't expect a massive amount of flooding from the ocean, but the storm is still dangerous. Heavy rain can back up into the city, also causing flooding.\n\nSome hurricanes make landfall and move quickly, experts say, while others slow substantially.\n\n\"Really what happened, and why the storm has stalled, is because there's basically high pressure areas to the west of the storm and to the northeast, and that's kind of pinned the storm,\" said Phil Klotzbach, senior research scientist at Colorado State University's Department of Atmospheric Science. \"With a hurricane you always have wind problems, but when you have a storm moving at 3 to 5 miles an hour, it's going to be over any specific location for a very long period of time, so flash flooding and just tremendous rainfall totals are going to be very likely.\"\n\nExperts say the warming atmosphere plays a role in the severity of storm surges such as Debby.\n\nWarming water in the northeast Gulf of Mexico is increasing Hurricane Debby's heavy rains, as more moisture evaporates from the waters, Masters said. Some research says climate change can impact the forward motion of hurricanes, he added, making them go slower.\n\n\"It's something we've been seeing more of lately,\" Masters said.\n\nThe worst of the rain is expected during the first half of the week, but it could last through Saturday, forecasters said.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"},

The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nFlorida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.\n\nNo deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nMayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island: Don't let your guard down\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nIn saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nPackages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDebby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nBiden briefed on Debby's progress\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 50 mph (85 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was near the Florida-Georgia border and was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to decrease in speed as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBig worry is storm surge from Debby\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nHundreds of thousands without power\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this.

The governors of Georgia and South Carolina have declared states of emergency in anticipation of Debby's damage.\n\n\"This is going to be an event that is going to be probably here for the next five to seven days, maybe as long as 10 days, depending on how much rainfall we get,\" said Florida Division of Emergency Management Executive Director Kevin Guthrie.\n\nBy midday on Monday, Debby had already dumped up to 40cm of rain in some parts of central Florida, according to local weather reports.\n\nThe 12-year-old girl who died was hit by a falling tree in Levy County, DeSantis said.\n\nThe 13-year-old boy died when a tree fell on a mobile home, also in Levy County, the local Sheriff's Office said on its website.\n\nFurther south in Hillsborough County, rescue crews in Tampa recovered the body of an 18-wheeler truck driver who had lost control of the vehicle on Interstate 75 and went into the Tampa Bypass Canal, the local sheriff's office reported.\n\nThere were no immediate details on the fourth death from the governor's office, and a spokesperson was not immediately available for Reuters.\n\nRoughly 240,000 customers were without power in Florida, according to Poweroutage.us, and flight trackers showed hundreds of flights originating from and heading to Florida airports were cancelled.\n\nA slow-moving tropical storm as it passed over Cuba, Debby gained strength from exceptionally warm Gulf waters as it paralleled Florida's Gulf Coast on Sunday.\n\nDebby bears some of the hallmarks of Hurricane Harvey, which hit Corpus Christi, Texas, in August 2017.\n\nDowngraded to a tropical storm as it moved inland, Harvey lingered over Texas, dumping more than a metre of rain on Houston and causing $US125 billion ($A192 billion) in damage.", "source":

Storm surge warnings are in effect in parts of the three states, indicating \"life-threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline.\"\n\nThe storm will probably cause catastrophic flooding with \"potentially historic heavy rainfall\" when Debby moves northeast across Georgia and South Carolina over the next few days, the NHC said.\n\nBut it said Debby was weakening. The storm's maximum sustained winds were 80 miles (130 kilometers) per hour at landfall but dropped to 65 mph at the 2:00 pm ET (1800 GMT) update.\n\nDebby is expected to dump up to 18 inches of rainfall in parts of Florida, and as much as 30 inches in coastal Georgia, South Carolina, and parts of North Carolina before the week is over, the NHC said.\n\nMandatory evacuations were ordered for part of Citrus County, Florida, with eight other counties under voluntary evacuation orders, local media reported.\n\nThe governors of Georgia and South Carolina declared a state of emergency ahead of the storm's arrival.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Sunday approved an emergency declaration for Florida, allowing federal aid to be expedited.\n\nDeSantis has activated the state's National Guard, with 3,000 service members on standby to help with storm response.\n\nMeanwhile in the Florida Keys, Debby washed ashore 25 tightly wrapped packages of cocaine worth more than $1 million, according to a post on X by US Border Patrol acting chief patrol Agent Samuel Briggs II.", "source": {"uri": "jamaicaobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jamaica Observer"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nFlorida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.\n\nNo deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nMayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island: Don't let your guard down\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nIn saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nPackages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nDebby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nBiden briefed on Debby's progress\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 50 mph (85 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was near the Florida-Georgia border and was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to decrease in speed as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nBig worry is storm surge from Debby\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nHundreds of thousands without power\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\n-- -\n\nThis version corrects the attribution for power outage figures to PowerOutage.us, not PowerOutage.com.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.", "source": {"uri": "americanpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Officials said the dead included a 12-year-old girl and a 13-year-old boy.\n\nThe hurricane center sees Debby crossing Georgia and moving offshore into the Atlantic by Tuesday night, then re-strengthening and making a second landfall, probably in South Carolina near Charleston.\n\nThe center forecast \"catastrophic flooding,\" with some areas along the Atlantic coast receiving 20 to 30 inches of rain by Friday morning. The governors of Georgia and South Carolina have declared states of emergency in anticipation of Debby's damage.\n\n\"This is going to be an event that is going to be probably here for the next five to seven days, maybe as long as 10 days, depending on how much rainfall we get,\" said Florida Division of Emergency Management Executive Director Kevin Guthrie.\n\nBy midday Monday, Debby had already dumped eight to 16 inches of rain in some parts of central Florida, according to local weather reports.\n\nThe 12-year-old girl who died was hit by a falling tree in Levy County, about 40 miles southwest of Gainesville, DeSantis said. The 13-year-old boy died on Monday morning when a tree fell on a mobile home, also in Levy County, the local Sheriff's Office said on its website.\n\nFurther south in Hillsborough County, rescue crews in Tampa recovered the body of an 18-wheeler truck driver who had lost control of the vehicle on Interstate 75 and went into the Tampa Bypass Canal, the local sheriff's office reported.\n\nThere were no immediate details on the fourth death from the governor's office, and a spokesperson was not immediately available for Reuters.\n\nRoughly 240,000 customers were without power in Florida, according to Poweroutage.us, and flight trackers showed hundreds of flights originating from and heading to Florida airports were canceled on Monday.\n\nSlow drenching\n\nA slow-moving tropical storm as it passed over Cuba, Debby gained strength from exceptionally warm Gulf waters as it paralleled Florida's Gulf Coast on Sunday.\n\nDebby bears some of the hallmarks of Hurricane Harvey, which hit Corpus Christi, Texas, in August 2017. Downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved inland, Harvey lingered over Texas, dumping about 50 inches of rain on Houston and causing $125 billion in damage.\n\nClimate scientists believe man-made global warming from burning fossil fuels has raised the temperature of the oceans, making storms bigger and more devastating.\n\nThe last hurricane to make a direct hit on the Big Bend region was Hurricane Idalia, which briefly gained Category 4 strength before making landfall as a Category 3 in August 2023, with winds of more than 125 mph. The National Centers for Environmental Information estimated $3.5 billion in damages. DeSantis described the initial effects of Debby as \"modest\" compared with Idalia.\n\nForecasters expect numerous Atlantic hurricanes in the 2024 season, which began on June 1, including four to seven major ones. That would exceed the record-breaking 2005 season that spawned the devastating Katrina and Rita hurricanes.\n\nOnly one hurricane, Beryl, has yet formed in the Atlantic this year. The earliest Category 5 storm on record, it struck the Caribbean and Mexico's Yucatan peninsula before rolling up the Gulf Coast of Texas as a Category 1 storm, with sustained winds up to 95 mph. --

Verlyn Brock said the man died at the home in the city of Moultrie, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Valdosta, Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe storm has damaged roofs and downed power lines in Moultrie, Police Chief Chad Castleberry told WALB-TV.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Debby had top winds near 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening as it moved slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns eastward.\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, announces curfew, roads into historic city to be closed\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, officials announced a curfew starting at 11 p.m. Monday for the peninsula that makes up much of downtown and the older parts of the 350-year-old city as some of the heaviest rain from Tropical Storm Debby is expected to fall overnight.\n\nPolice will barricade all eight roads leading into the peninsula and only let essential workers and emergency personnel in or out. High-water vehicles will also be staged to go into the area as needed, Charleston Mayor William Cogswell said at a Monday evening news conference.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We need people to make their way out. This is not something you can stay at the bar until 10:45. We need you to take this seriously,\" Cogswell said.\n\nThe mayor said forecasters told him 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain could fall in Charleston overnight.\n\nCity officials will assess the situation early Tuesday and decide how and when to reopen roads and lift the curfew.\n\nNo evacuations planned for now in South Carolina, officials say\n\nState officials don't plan any evacuations in South Carolina for now as Tropical Storm Debby slowly spins toward the state.\n\nLarge-scale evacuations typically bring people inland from the coast, and forecasters say Debby's biggest impacts could be as much as 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain in localized areas throughout the state, causing floodwaters to rise quickly in small areas. So any evacuations will up to local leaders.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"This storm may not have the high winds of a hurricane, but it has the potential to cause life-threatening floods across the state. And I would like to emphasize that Tropical Storm Debby is not just a coastal event, but it is a statewide event,\" state Emergency Management Division Director Kim Stenson said at a Monday afternoon news conference.\n\nBiden approves request from South Carolina's governor for emergency declaration\n\nThe White House said Monday that President Joe Biden has approved a request from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said personnel from the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard are deploying to the region and are prepared to support recovery efforts.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday ahead of Debby's anticipated rainfall. Flooding and power outages are expected to start Tuesday and continue through the rest of the week, according to North Carolina Emergency Management officials.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis previously had declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida's 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also had made his own emergency declaration.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nCurfew announced for Savannah and surrounding county as Debby approaches\n\nWith Debby's winds and rains expected to worsen overnight, officials for Savannah and surrounding Chatham County announced that an overnight curfew will take effect at 10 p.m. Monday and run to 6 a.m. Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nFlorida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.\n\nNo deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nMayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island: Don't let your guard down\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nIn saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nPackages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nDebby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBiden briefed on Debby's progress\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nBig worry is storm surge from Debby\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nHundreds of thousands without power\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\n-- -\n\nThis version corrects the attribution for power outage figures to PowerOutage.us, not PowerOutage.com.", "source": {"uri":

Savannah Mayor Van Johnson told residents to expect a rough day Tuesday. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, which is based on wind speeds, meteorologists say it's the storm's rainfall capacity that makes it extremely dangerous.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nDebby's center was over southeastern Georgia early Tuesday with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (75 kph), and it was moving northeast near 7 mph (11 kph). The center is expected to move off Georgia's coast later Tuesday. Some strengthening is forecast on Wednesday and Thursday as Debby drifts offshore, before it moves inland over South Carolina on Thursday.\n\nThe emergency plan in the city of Charleston, South Carolina, includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters, and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed by flooding.\n\nHundreds rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, area, officials say\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said Monday in a social media post.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said in a social media update.\n\nJust north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"We are facing an unprecedented weather event with Hurricane Debby,\" said Jodie Fiske, Manatee County's public safety director. \"The safety of our residents is our top priority, and we are doing everything in our power to respond effectively to this crisis.\"\n\nMan killed when storm topples large tree onto home in south Georgia, officials say\n\nHeavy winds and rain associated with Debby toppled a large tree onto a porch at a home in south Georgia, killing a 19-year-old man, authorities said Monday.\n\nColquitt County Coroner C. Verlyn Brock said the man died at the home in the city of Moultrie, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Valdosta, Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.\n\nThe storm has damaged roofs and downed power lines in Moultrie, Police Chief Chad Castleberry told WALB-TV.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Debby had top winds near 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening as it moved slowly to the northeast.

least five dead.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died when a tree was blown onto a mobile home in Levy County, the sheriff's office there said, after Debby made landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast earlier Monday as a Category One hurricane.\n\nAuthorities said a truck driver was killed after his 18-wheeler plunged into a canal in Hillsborough County, while a 38-year-old woman and 12-year-old boy died in a car crash in Dixie County.\n\nAs the storm moved northward into Georgia, a 19-year-old was killed when a tree fell into the side of a house, according to the Colquitt County coroner's office.\n\nEarly Tuesday morning, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) was warning of \"potentially historic heavy rainfall\" and \"catastrophic flooding\" in parts of southeast Georgia and eastern South Carolina.\n\nThe Weather Channel reported tornadoes in South Carolina overnight.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has approved emergency declarations for Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, allowing for federal assistance in coordinating disaster relief efforts.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis also activated his state's National Guard, with more than 3,000 service members mobilized to help with storm response.\n\nMore from this section Harris set to name VP pick ahead of swing state tour 4 Tips to Keeping Your Gut Healthy and Free of IBD China shrug off doping controversy, win 12 Olympic

winds of 45 mph (75 kph) as it swept through Georgia, expected to later move offshore.\n\nThe storm is set to move along the East Coast, but has already weakened after making initial landfall with sustained speeds of 80 mph (130 kph) as a Category One hurricane -- the lowest on a scale of five.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris -- the Democratic candidate in the US presidential election -- postponed events in North Carolina and Georgia this week due to the storm, according to local media reports and her campaign team.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Border Patrol announced that Debby had washed up 25 packages of cocaine worth around $1 million to the coast of the Florida Keys, where they were seized.\n\nIn July, at least 18 people were killed when the powerful Hurricane Beryl tore through the Caribbean before hitting the southern US states of Texas and Louisiana.\n\nScientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of storms such as Beryl because there is more

Carolina coast on Thursday, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC).\n\n\"This is a level four out of four risk for excessive rainfall,\" Michael Brennan, director of the NHC, told reporters.\n\n\"This is going to result in a prolonged extreme rainfall event with potential for catastrophic flooding across coastal portions of Georgia, South Carolina, even extending up into North Carolina,\" he added.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis said that some 250,000 residents in his state were without power.\n\n\"Please, be very cautious when you're going out,\" he said, adding that Debby's winds had not been as damaging as previous hurricanes that have hit Florida.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Sunday approved an emergency declaration for Florida, allowing federal aid to be

after making landfall earlier with sustained speeds of 80 mph (130 kph) as a Category One hurricane -- the lowest on a scale of five.\n\nMandatory evacuations were ordered for part of Citrus County, Florida, with eight other counties under voluntary evacuation orders, local media reported.\n\nPolice in the city of Sarasota said that some 500 residents were evacuated from their flooded

Here's how much rain could fall", "body": "By ALEXA ST. JOHN - Associated Press\n\nNorthern Florida, the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina and parts of North Carolina are bracing for severe rain and catastrophic flooding this week as the Debby storm system moves up and east.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on the Big Bend coast of Florida early Monday, first hitting the small community of Steinhatchee. It damaged homes and businesses, sent floodwaters rising, caused sweeping power outages across the state and Georgia and led to several fatalities. Debby was downgraded to a tropical storm midday Monday.\n\nBut experts say the worst is yet to come as the storm system is expected to stall over the Southeast region.\n\nPeople are also reading...

More than 23 inches (58 centimeters) of rain was recorded in South Carolina after that storm hit the Carolinas.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, \"It really is worthy of a Category 3 or 4 rating, if you want to talk about rainfall impacts,\" said Jeff Masters, founder of Weather Underground, now with Yale Climate Connections. \"That's going to cause a lot of damage.\"\n\nWhat areas are at risk?\n\nNorthern Florida as well as low-lying areas including Savannah, Georgia, and Hilton Head Island and Charleston, South Carolina, are expected to see the most severe flooding. North Carolina could also be impacted.\n\nOfficials in Savannah warned the area could see a month's worth of rain in four days if the system stalls. There were also flooding concerns for Tybee Island, Georgia's largest public beach 18 miles (28.97 kilometers) east of Savannah. On top of any torrential downpours that Debby dishes out, the island could get even wetter from 2 to 4 feet of storm surge, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Hilton Head Island Mayor Alan Perry said on a video posted to Facebook. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.\n\nFew places in South Carolina are as susceptible to flooding as Charleston. Much of the city and surrounding areas founded in 1670 were built on land created by using fill dirt and other debris. Rising sea levels cause a number of minor flooding events even without a storm and like many coastal cities, Charleston can't drain well.\n\nThe city doesn't expect a massive amount of flooding from the ocean, but the storm is still dangerous. Heavy rain can back up into the city, also causing flooding.\n\nWhat's causing this storm to stall?\n\nSome hurricanes make landfall and move quickly, experts say, while others slow substantially.\n\n\"Really what happened, and why the storm has stalled, is because there's basically high pressure areas to the west of the storm and to the northeast, and that's kind of pinned the storm,\" said Phil Klotzbach, senior research scientist at Colorado State University's Department of Atmospheric Science. \"With a hurricane you always have wind problems, but when you have a storm moving at 3 to 5 miles an hour, it's going to be over any specific location for a very long period of time, so flash flooding and just tremendous rainfall totals are going to be very likely.\"\n\nExperts say the warming atmosphere plays a role in the severity of storm surges such as Debby.\n\nWarming water in the northeast Gulf of Mexico is increasing Hurricane Debby's heavy rains, as more moisture evaporates from the waters, Masters said. Some research says climate change can impact the forward motion of hurricanes, he added, making them go slower.\n\n\"It's something we've been seeing more of lately,\" Masters said.\n\nHow long could this last?\n\nThe worst of the rain is expected during the first half of the week, but it could last through Saturday, forecasters said.\n\nSt. John reported from Detroit.

Savannah Mayor Van Johnson told residents to expect a rough day Tuesday. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, which is based on wind speeds, meteorologists say it's the storm's rainfall capacity that makes it extremely dangerous.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nDebby's center was over southeastern Georgia early Tuesday with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (75 kph), and it was moving northeast near 7 mph (11 kph). The center is expected to move off Georgia's coast later Tuesday. Some strengthening is forecast on Wednesday and Thursday as Debby drifts offshore, before it moves inland over South Carolina on Thursday.\n\nThe emergency plan in the city of Charleston, South Carolina, includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters, and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed by flooding.\n\nHundreds rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, area, officials say\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said Monday in a social media post.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said in a social media update.\n\nJust north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"We are facing an unprecedented weather event with Hurricane Debby,\" said Jodie Fiske, Manatee County's public safety director. \"The safety of our residents is our top priority, and we are doing everything in our power to respond effectively to this crisis.\"\n\nMan killed when storm topples large tree onto home in south Georgia, officials say\n\nHeavy winds and rain associated with Debby toppled a large tree onto a porch at a home in south Georgia, killing a 19-year-old man, authorities said Monday.\n\nColquitt County Coroner C. Verlyn Brock said the man died at the home in the city of Moultrie, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Valdosta, Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.\n\nThe storm has damaged roofs and downed power lines in Moultrie, Police Chief Chad Castleberry told WALB-TV.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Debby had top winds near 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening as it moved slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns eastward.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Ron DeSantis warned that the state could continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\nDebby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It since has weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, covering roads with water and contributing to at least five deaths.\n\nA truck driver died on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, according to the Levy County sheriff's office.\n\nAnd in Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night. The Florida Highway Patrol said a 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries.\n\nPhoto GalleryTropical Storm Debby hits Florida\n\nIn southern Georgia, a 19-year-old man died Monday afternoon when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n\nNearly 200,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nAirports were also affected. More than 1,600 flights had been canceled nationwide, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.\n\nThe potential for high water also threatened Savannah, Ga., and Charleston, S.C.\n\nLocal leaders in Savannah said flooding could happen in areas that don't usually get high water if Debby stalls out over the city. With winds and rainfall expected to worsen overnight, authorities issued a curfew from 10 p.m. Monday until 6 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nNorth Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed Monday.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Freida Frisaro, Kate Payne, Michael Schneider, Russ Bynum, Jeffrey Collins, Darlene

Even with the slight dip in intensity, Debby was forecast to bring dangerous storm surge to parts of the Gulf Coast of Florida through Monday afternoon.\n\nTropical Storm Debby was barreling across northern Florida on Monday morning after making landfall over the state's Big Bend coast as a Category 1 hurricane. Even with the slight dip in intensity, Debby was forecast to bring dangerous storm surge to parts of the Gulf Coast of Florida through Monday afternoon.\n\nThe storm could bring historic rainfall to surrounding states like Georgia and South Carolina, too, the National Hurricane Center said, warning that Debby was expected to cause \"major flooding\" to parts of the southeastern United States over the next several days.\n\nDebby slammed into the Big Bend coast, where the Florida panhandle meets the peninsula, near Steinhatchee, a small oceanside town about 70 miles west of Gainesville, at around 7 a.m. EDT. The hurricane center said it was was tracking slightly inland in the Big Bend region about an hour after landfall, with maximum sustained winds of 75 miles per hour. That marked a marginal decrease in power, as meteorologists estimated that Debby struck the coast with 80 mph winds.\n\nBy 2 p.m., sustained wind speeds had fallen to about 65 mph, with higher gusts, as the tropical storm churned along its anticipated north-northeastern route. Meteorologists said at the time that Debby was located about 10 miles northwest of Live Oak, Florida, and traveling at around 7 mph. Tropical-storm-force winds extended outward up to 140 miles from the eye of the storm, which was expected to gradually weaken over the coming days.\n\nMeteorologists expected that storm surge would be most catastrophic in the immediate vicinity of the landfall location, with initial forecasts indicating a 130-mile stretch of coastline between Yankeetown and the Aucilla River could see surges between 6 and 10 feet above ground. Storm surge threats gradually lessened as the hours passed after Debby's landfall, with forecasters saying by the afternoon that peak surge in that region would look more like 3 to 5 feet.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center published maps on Monday illustrating the storm surge forecast.\n\nThe below map, updated on Monday afternoon, shows the highest potential values in the peak surge range, and includes the tide, the hurricane center said. Meteorologists noted that the timing of peak surge and high tide in a given area, and whether they coincide or not, will ultimately determine how destructive the inundation will be.\n\nStorm surge threats were expected to abate farther into the panhandle and down the length of the Gulf Coast -- but only somewhat. Meteorologists warned that surges as high as 3 feet could hit areas west of the Aucilla River to Indian Pass, and south of Yankeetown to Bonita Beach. That stretch includes Tampa Bay and the surrounding area. A shorter stretch of the Gulf Coast from Yankeetown to Aripeka was still at risk of slightly higher surges at 2 p.m., according to the hurricane center.\n\nCoastal places as far south as Bonita Beach could see heavy rainfall coupled with storm surge for the next several days as a result of the tropical storm. So could coastal areas along a vast stretch of the southeastern U.S., from the mouth of the St. Mary's River, around where Florida meets Georgia, up to the South Santee River in South Carolina. That southeastern stretch includes major cities in both states, Savannah and Charleston, and could weather storm surge up to 4 feet above ground as Debby continues to turn northeastward.\n\nDebby was slowing down after making landfall on Monday, and the hurricane center said that the anticipated rainfall totals along its path are so massive in part because the storm is lingering over each place it passes.\n\nAs it shifts farther east, the storm was expected to touch an expansive spread along the southeastern U.S. through the Carolinas before dissipating. In the hurricane center's most recent path forecast for Debby, meteorologists projected the storm would continue tracking across northern Florida and up through a portion of the southeastern coast of Georgia later on Monday and into Tuesday. The latest forecasts extended by 6 hours the time frame in which Debby would travel up to Georgia and the Carolinas.\n\nForecasts suggested the storm could move off a linear path again late Tuesday and Wednesday, traveling inland while continuing northward to South Carolina and then likely turning back toward the coast on Thursday.\n\nThe hurricane center had predicted that Debby would weaken rapidly after the eye of the storm moved inland into northern Florida, shifting back into a tropical storm. But meteorologists also warned that Debby could strengthen again after an initial period of weakening, depending on whether it oscillates between an inland and coastal path during its route over the southeastern states.\n\nDebby was also expected to dump heavy rain totaling 6 to 12 inches, and even as high as 18 inches in some places, across central and northern Florida as well as central and northeast North Carolina throughout the rest of the week until Saturday morning. Meteorologists warned that the rainfall would likely cause considerable flash and urban flooding, and significant river flooding, in parts of the affected states.\n\nPortions of southeast Georgia, the coastal plains of South Carolina and southeast North Carolina could see 10 to 20 inches of rainfall as Debby continues on its path, with maximum rainfall amounts as high as 30 inches, or almost three feet, in certain areas.\n\nNone of the formidable rainfall estimates or related flood warnings have changed since Debby made landfall, even after it was downgraded to a tropical storm.\n\nA handful of tornadoes could develop over central and northern Florida, as well as southeastern Georgia, on Monday, forecasters said. The tornado threat was expected to travel northeastward with the storm, into parts of South Carolina, later in the day and into Monday night.", "source": {"uri": "newson6.com", "dataType": "news",

tree was blown onto a mobile home in Levy County, the sheriff's office there said, after Debby made landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast earlier Monday as a Category One hurricane.\n\nAuthorities said a truck driver was killed after his 18-wheeler plunged into a canal in Hillsborough County, while a 38-year-old woman and 12-year-old boy died in a car crash in Dixie County.\n\nAs the storm moved northward into Georgia, a 19-year-old was killed when a tree fell into the side of a house, according to the Colquitt County coroner's office.\n\nEarly Tuesday morning, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) was warning of \"potentially historic heavy rainfall\" and \"catastrophic flooding\" in parts of southeast Georgia and eastern South Carolina.\n\nThe Weather Channel reported tornadoes in South Carolina overnight.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has approved emergency declarations for Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, allowing for federal assistance in coordinating disaster relief efforts.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis also activated his state's National Guard, with more than 3,000 service members mobilized to help with storm response.\n\nThe governors of Georgia and South Carolina declared a state of emergency ahead of Debby's arrival.\n\nBy Tuesday morning, the NHC said the storm was registering maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph) as it swept through Georgia, expected to later move offshore.\n\nThe storm is set to move along the East Coast, but has already weakened after making initial landfall with sustained speeds of 80 mph (130 kph) as a Category One hurricane -- the lowest on a scale of five.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris -- the Democratic candidate in the US presidential election -- postponed events in North Carolina and Georgia this week due to the storm, according to local media reports and her campaign team.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Border Patrol announced that Debby had washed up 25 packages of cocaine worth around $1 million to the coast of the Florida Keys, where they were seized.\n\nIn July, at least 18 people were killed when the powerful Hurricane Beryl tore through the Caribbean before hitting the southern US states of Texas and Louisiana.\n\nScientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of storms such as Beryl because there is more energy in a warmer ocean for them to feed on.", "source":

Savannah Mayor Van Johnson told residents to expect a rough day Tuesday. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, which is based on wind speeds, meteorologists say it's the storm's rainfall capacity that makes it extremely dangerous.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nDebby's center was over southeastern Georgia early Tuesday with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (75 kph), and it was moving northeast near 7 mph (11 kph). The center is expected to move off Georgia's coast later Tuesday. Some strengthening is forecast on Wednesday and Thursday as Debby drifts offshore, before it moves inland over South Carolina on Thursday.\n\nThe emergency plan in the city of Charleston, South Carolina, includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters, and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed by flooding.\n\nHundreds rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, area, officials say\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said Monday in a social media post.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said in a social media update.\n\nJust north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"We are facing an unprecedented weather event with Hurricane Debby,\" said Jodie Fiske, Manatee County's public safety director. \"The safety of our residents is our top priority, and we are doing everything in our power to respond effectively to this crisis.\"\n\nMan killed when storm topples large tree onto home in south Georgia, officials say\n\nHeavy winds and rain associated with Debby toppled a large tree onto a porch at a home in south Georgia, killing a 19-year-old man, authorities said Monday.\n\nColquitt County Coroner C. Verlyn Brock said the man died at the home in the city of Moultrie, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Valdosta, Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.\n\nThe storm has damaged roofs and downed power lines in Moultrie, Police Chief Chad Castleberry told WALB-TV.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Debby had top winds near 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening as it moved slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns eastward.\n\nMore from this section\n\nReformed Gangster Disciples Boss, Harold 'Noonie G' Ward Hosts Citywide Voter

As Debby slows, stalling over the region, the tropical system is expected to spread record rainfall and cause severe to extreme flooding across Georgia and the Carolinas throughout the week.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Debby is expected to unleash up to 12 to 18 inches of rain across parts of central and northern Florida as well as parts of North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nFlooding rain is the main concern. Numerous tropical and flooding alerts are in place for coastal and inland communities across Florida and into southeast Georgia and South Carolina. Debby is expected to grind to a halt and become a huge flood-maker -- copious amounts of moisture will help the storm deliver about 1 to 2 feet of rainfall across the region through Thursday.\n\nThe main cause of this torrential rain lies in Debby's interaction with a blocking high-pressure system and frontal boundary that'll slow the storm's progression to less than 5 miles per hour, where the storm will essentially hover over the Southeast.\n\nIt looks like the system will then return to warm waters just off the southeast coast, which will feed plumes of moisture to keep the system intact and the rain pouring down.\n\nNOAA's Weather Prediction Center has issued a high risk for excessive rainfall for that region. Numerous, significant flooding events will continue each day as this system crawls up the Eastern Seaboard. I would expect some areas to see localized storm totals of over 30 inches.\n\nSome areas along Florida's west coast have seen nearly a foot of rain in less than 24 hours.\n\nCedar Key along the Big Bend of Florida has seen nearly 6 feet of storm surge as Debby made landfall and will continue to see similarly strong surge through tonight.\n\nDangerous storm surge will continue to stretch along southeast shores at least through the middle of this week as Debby lingers. Florida's west coast from Naples, through Tampa, and to Indian Pass will see mostly 3 to 6 feet of inundation that will exacerbate coastal flooding.\n\nAs Debby moves closer to the Atlantic coast of Georgia and South Carolina, up to 6 feet of storm surge is expected from Jacksonville through Hilton Head, S.C.\n\nLandfall wind speeds were 80 mph with gusts well into the 90s. Tropical Storm Debby had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph as of Monday afternoon and wind speeds are expected to weaken as the system traverses over land today and Tuesday. Debby should still hold tropical storm force winds through the next few days -- which range from 39 to 73 mph.\n\nThe forecast track of the storm points to Debby bringing heavy rain to New England later this week and into the weekend.\n\nIt's still early to tell where and how Debby will move after spending the better half of a week over the Southeast, but there are some clear indicators that the track may very well take it along the Eastern Seaboard toward New England.\n\nDirect Impacts\n\nWe are likely not going to see a tropical storm, but the remnant low-pressure system of Debby will encroach near the region later this weekend. There is the chance that the center of the system may get close to New England and we can feel direct impacts from rounds of rainfall. Timing is still very early, but it looks like any direct rainfall may be Sunday into Monday.\n\nThis will depend on the strength of the Bermuda high over the northern Atlantic, which has been quite strong this summer and has been halting fronts from moving west to east over New England at a number of times this summer. This strong high may prevent Debby from meandering into the Atlantic and instead influence it's track up the coast.\n\nOur current weather pattern won't be doing us any favors. A separate front stretches west to east over the next few days and will likely cause rounds of showers and thunderstorms to soak the ground across New England. That will lower the flooding threshold later in the week when the soaking remnants of Debby arrive. These preceding storms will make marginal rainfall totals much more impactful as we move into the weekend.\n\nThis same frontal boundary will also bow to the south/southwest and likely tap into the moisture-rich environment in the Southeast where Debby is wreaking havoc.\n\nStorms love to track along frontal boundaries and this could open the faucet and invite chunks of moisture to break off from Debby and shoot into the region, despite how far south the core of the storm is located.\n\nThis means periods of steady to heavy rain may cause flooding as early as Thursday that could potentially last through Sunday as the center of the system moves closer.\n\nAs Debbie slowly tracks towards the Northeast, it will continue to weaken over land, which will reduce the forcing needed to keep a tropical system together. This will likely expand Debby's rain field across the Northeast.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Most times, a storm will move up the East Coast in just a few days, but not this one because there are no currents to move it along.\n\n\"Think of a leaf in a river or stream that gets pushed by that stream; well, the stream basically disappears, and it doesn't push it as it gets to our area,\" he said.

It really only covered the Charleston and tri-county area versus this one, which will be in our area from the South Santee River down to the Altamaha River (GA),\" he said. \"Several counties inland in Southeast South Carolina could see these rainfall amounts. We still think the highest probability of getting those amounts would be closer to the coast.\"\n\nMorals said he is not exactly sure when the rain will eventually stop. Some forecasts have it moving out on Thursday, while others show it still rains on Friday. That is why the South Carolina Emergency Management Division is asking residents to prepare an emergency kit and double-check emergency plans.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType":

SIMONS ISLAND, Ga. - Forecasters are warning that heavy rain from Tropical Storm Debby could spawn catastrophic flooding in Georgia and surrounding states.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nStorm surge is a major concern along the coast on top of the rain. Some areas are set to see 3-6 inches of rain on Monday into Tuesday and 10 or more inches over the next three days.\n\nThousands were already without power on Monday afternoon.\n\nGovernor Brian P. Kemp issued a state of emergency for all 159 Georgia counties ahead of the storm.\n\nIn Savannah, local leaders said flooding could happen in areas that don't usually get high water if Debby stalls out over the city.\n\n\"This type of rain hovering over us, coming with the intensity that they tell us it is coming, it's going to catch a whole lot of people by surprise,\" said Chatham County Chairman Chester Ellis.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.\n\nThe city of Charleston has an emergency plan in place that includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, flooding rains fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding that nearly knocked Columbia's water system offline.\n\nIn 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.\n\nIn Savannah, Jim Froncak piled sandbags into his pickup truck on Monday, as rain was already falling. He said a recent thunderstorm caused so much flooding that he and a friend were able to kayak down a street.\n\n\"That was just a thunderstorm,\" he said. \"So, who knows what could happen with this?\"\n\nGeorgia DOT teams statewide have equipment loaded and crews are on alert, including immediate-response strike teams ready to respond to the historic rainfall event and expected flooding in Southern and Southeastern Georgia this week. Motorists can expect detours and road closures as the department responds to the anticipated impacts of the storm.", "source": {"uri": "news4jax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News 4 Jax"},

Savannah Mayor Van Johnson told residents to expect a rough day Tuesday. Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nAlthough Debby was classified as a Category 1, which is based on wind speeds, meteorologists say it's the storm's rainfall capacity that makes it extremely dangerous.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nDebby's center was over southeastern Georgia early Tuesday with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph (75 kph), and it was moving northeast near 7 mph (11 kph). The center is expected to move off Georgia's coast later Tuesday.

killed after Storm Debby hits Florida coast", "body": "A Florida National Guard vehicle drives through a flooded street\n\nAt least four people were killed as Tropical Storm Debby drenched Florida on Monday, threatening southeastern US states with heavy rainfall and catastrophic flooding.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died when a tree was blown onto a mobile home in Levy County, the sheriff's office there said, after Debby made landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast earlier Monday as a Category One hurricane.\n\nAuthorities said a truck driver was killed after his 18-wheeler plunged into a canal in Hillsborough County, while a 38-year-old woman and 12-year-old boy died in a car crash in Dixie County.\n\nThe storm is expected to move into Georgia overnight, before moving offshore and approaching the South Carolina coast on Thursday, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC).\n\n\"This is a level four out of four risk for excessive rainfall,\" Michael Brennan, director of the NHC, told reporters.\n\n\"This is going to result in a prolonged extreme rainfall event with potential for catastrophic flooding across coastal portions of Georgia, South Carolina, even extending up into North Carolina,\" he added.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis said that some 250,000 residents in his state were without power.\n\n\"Please, be very cautious when you're going out,\" he said, adding that Debby's winds had not been as damaging as previous hurricanes that have hit Florida.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Sunday approved an emergency declaration for Florida, allowing federal aid to be expedited.\n\nDeSantis has activated the state's National Guard, with more than 3,000 service members mobilized to help with storm response.\n\n- Evacuation orders -\n\nBy late afternoon, the NHC said the storm was registering maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph) as it swept over Florida.\n\nStorm surge warnings -- signalling a life-threatening inundation from rising water -- are in effect in parts of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.\n\nDebby was expected to bring \"potentially historic rainfall\" of up to 30 inches as it moved north, the NHC said.\n\nBut it said Debby was weakening after making landfall earlier with sustained speeds of 80 mph (130 kph) as a Category One hurricane -- the lowest on a scale of five.\n\nMandatory evacuations were ordered for part of Citrus County, Florida, with eight other counties under voluntary evacuation orders, local media reported.\n\nPolice in the city of Sarasota said that some 500 residents were evacuated from their flooded homes.\n\nThe governors of Georgia and South Carolina have declared a state of emergency ahead of the storm's arrival.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Border Patrol announced that Debby had washed up 25 packages of cocaine to the coast of the Florida Keys, where they were seized.\n\nThe intended shipment had a street value of more than $1 million, acting chief patrol Agent Samuel Briggs II said on X.\n\nIn July, at least 18 people were killed when the powerful Hurricane Beryl tore through the Caribbean before hitting the southern US states of Texas and Louisiana.\n\nScientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of storms such as Beryl because there is more energy in a warmer ocean for them to feed on.\n\nbur-ia/bjt/dw\n\nMore from this section\n\nGoogle illegally

(Reuters)\n\nTropical Storm Debby dropped buckets of rain across northern Florida yesterday afternoon as it plodded toward Georgia and the Carolinas, where forecasters expect the downgraded hurricane to bring a week of torrential downpours and catastrophic flooding.\n\nThe storm had lost some of its windspeed after slamming Florida's Gulf Coast around 7am last morning as a Category 1 hurricane. It made landfall near Steinhatchee, in the Big Bend region about 70 miles southeast of Tallahassee, delivering winds of up to 80mph, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nThe hurricane centre predicted Debby would move offshore into the Atlantic by Tuesday night, then re-strengthen and come back inland to drench the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina later in the week.\n\nThe centre forecast \"catastrophic flooding,\" with local areas along Georgia and South Carolina's coastline receiving 20 to 30 inches of rain by Friday morning. The governors of Georgia and South Carolina have declared states of emergency in anticipation of Debby's damage.\n\n\"This is going to be an event that is going to be probably here for the next five to seven days, maybe as long as 10 days, depending on how much rainfall we get,\" said Florida Division of Emergency Management Executive Director Kevin Guthrie.\n\nBy midday yesterday, Debby had already dumped eight to 16 inches of rain in some parts of central Florida, according to local weather reports.\n\nHours after the storm's landfall in Steinhatchee, heavy rains were still falling on the beach town, and bayfront restaurants were flooded. Further south in Hillsborough County, rescue crews in Tampa recovered the body of an 18-wheeler truck driver who had lost control of the vehicle on Interstate 75 and went into the Tampa Bypass Canal, local TV station WTSP reported.\n\nRoughly 240,000 customers were without power in Florida, according to Poweroutage.us, and flight trackers showed hundreds of flights originating from and heading to Florida airports were cancelled yesterday.\n\nA slow-moving tropical storm as it passed over Cuba, Debby gained strength from exceptionally warm Gulf waters as it paralleled Florida's Gulf Coast on Sunday.\n\nDebby bears some of the hallmarks of Hurricane Harvey, which hit Corpus Christi, Texas, in August 2017. Downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved inland, Harvey lingered over Texas, dumping about 50 inches of rain on Houston and causing $125bn in damage.\n\nClimate scientists believe man-made global warming from burning fossil fuels has raised the temperature of the oceans, making storms bigger and more devastating. The last hurricane to make a direct hit on the Big Bend region was Hurricane Idalia, which briefly gained Category 4 strength before making landfall as a Category 3 in August 2023, with winds of more than 125mph.\n\nThe National Centers for Environmental Information estimated $3.5bn in damages. DeSantis described the initial effects of Debby as \"modest\" compared with Idalia.\n\nForecasters expect numerous Atlantic hurricanes in the 2024 season, which began on June 1, including four to seven major ones. That would exceed the record-breaking 2005 season that spawned the devastating Katrina and Rita hurricanes.\n\nOnly one hurricane, Beryl, has yet formed in the Atlantic this year. The earliest Category 5 storm on record, it struck the Caribbean and Mexico's Yucatan peninsula before rolling up the Gulf Coast of Texas as a Category 1 storm, with sustained winds up to 95mph.",

And even though it's more than 800 miles away from New Jersey, the storm has the potential to dump heavy rain on the Garden State later this week into the early weekend.\n\nThat's the latest prediction by weather forecasters, who say New Jersey also faces a threat of street flooding and river flooding from a different storm system on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nThe first batch of rain will be triggered by a cold front that will be moving in from the northwest and is expected to slow down or stall near the Mid-Atlantic coast, forecasters said. Although the front is not related to Tropical Storm Debby, southerly winds could push tropical moisture up north, boosting the amount of potential rain affecting New Jersey during the next several days.\n\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday, flash flooding is possible in urban areas and places with poor drainage, prompting the National Weather Service to issue a flood watch for 15 New Jersey counties -- Bergen, Burlington, Camden, Essex, Gloucester, Hudson, Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean, Passaic, Salem, Somerset and Union.\n\nThe flood watch is active from 2 p.m. Tuesday through noon Wednesday in Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Passaic and Union counties, and 5 p.m. Tuesday through 8 a.m. Wednesday in the other counties. counties.\n\nAs of 5 p.m. Monday, the center of Tropical Storm Debby was lingering in northern Florida and slowly moving north-northeast into southern Georgia, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm's center was located about 30 miles southeast of Valdosta, Georgia.\n\nDebby, which made landfall in the Big Bend region of Florida Monday morning as a Category 1 hurricane with top winds of 80 mph, was packing sustained winds up to 50 mph as of 5 p.m.\n\nThe storm's biggest threat continues to be its immense amount of moisture and slow movement, which is allowing bands of heavy rain to fall on the same general areas of Florida and Georgia, forecasters say.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center says as much as 12 to 16 inches of rain could drench southeastern Georgia and the coastal plain of South Carolina during the next five days, and southern and southeastern sections of North Carolina could get hit with up to 12 to 16 inches of rain in the next five days.\n\nAs much as 6 to 12 inches of rain is possible across a wide swath of central North Carolina, according to a latest forecast map from the National Hurricane Center.\n\nSome forecasters in the New Jersey region say the remnants of Tropical Storm Debby could bring anywhere from 3 to 8 inches of rain to the Garden State, along with the New York City and Philadelphia metro areas, later this week into early this weekend. However, there's a slight chance the heaviest bands of rain could move farther east, out over the Atlantic Ocean, instead of drifting directly over land.\n\nThe exact track of the storm and its remnants won't be known until Debby moves through Georgia and the Carolinas -- a trek that might be a long one because the storm is expected to stall out or move very slowly between Tuesday morning and Thursday morning.\n\nOfficials in Florida say four people, including two youths, have been killed in incidents related to Debby.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died when a tree fell onto a mobile home near Gainesville, and a car crash linked to the stormy weather claimed the life of a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy, according to reports by NBC News and 7-News in South Carolina.\n\nAlso, the driver of a semi-truck died after his vehicle veered out of control on a wet highway and the cab was submerged in a canal near Interstate 75 near Tampa, 7-News reported.\n\nMore than 300,000 utility customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nThank you for relying on us to provide the local weather news you can trust.

Ron DeSantis said at least four deaths have been linked to Debby.\n\nTwo people were killed in a crash in Dixie County while one person was killed in a crash in Hillsborough County, DeSantis said.\n\nIn Levy County, officials said a tree fell over onto a mobile home, crushing and killing a 13-year-old boy who was inside.\n\nAround 250,000 customers were without power in Florida on Monday morning, while around 450,000 accounts had been restored, DeSantis said.\n\nIn Marion County, which is inland and south of Gainesville, sheriff's officials noted in a Facebook post Monday that crews were responding to reports of downed power lines and trees that have fallen on roadways and homes.\n\nDeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\nIn Union County, some roads were already under water and numerous trees and powerlines were down. The Union County Sheriff's Office said Monday that residents were cleaning up from a tornado that touched down in the county Sunday night, damaging at least one home. No injuries were reported.\n\nHurricane Debby has followed a track \"very similar to Idalia 11 months ago,\" DeSantis said. Idalia came ashore near Keaton Beach, Florida on Aug. 30, 2023, with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph. Keaton Beach is about 20 miles north of Steinhatchee. He noted there were fewer power outages with Debby.\n\nImages posted on social media by Cedar Key Fire Rescue early Monday showed floodwaters rising along the streets of the city, located south of where the storm made landfall. Water was \"coming in at a pretty heavy pace,\" the post said.\n\nIn Live Oak, the roof of a warehouse was partially torn off, as pieces of metal from the structure were scattered on the street. Police were also blocking off several roads that had been flooded.\n\nCrews from all over the state responded to help out, including Miami-Dade Fire Rescue, who sent around 50 personnel including rescue specialists, K-9 search teams, engineers and medical workers.\n\nOfficials in Venice posted photos of a roadway left damaged by the hurricane.\n\n\"Right now, we are to trying secure everything from floating away,\" said Sheryl Horne, whose family owns the Shell Island Fish Camp along the Wakulla River in St. Marks, Florida, where some customers moved their boats inland.\n\nThe sparsely populated Big Bend region in the Florida Panhandle also was hit last year by Hurricane Idalia, which made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane.\n\n\"I am used to storms and I'm used to cleaning up after storms,\" Horne said.\n\n\"We're all hanging on here - a bunch of us stayed,\" Dawn Perez said Monday by phone, as the eyewall of Hurricane Debby bore down on her home in the small town of Perry, Florida. Perez, the director of the town's tourism department, said she has a new roof after Hurricane Idalia tore it apart in August 2023.\n\n\"The winds are intense - I've already lost my porch door and a tree, and stuff is blowing all over the place,\" Perez said.\n\nDebby is the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season after Tropical Storm Alberto, Hurricane Beryl and Tropical Storm Chris, all of which formed in June.", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall",

(WTVD) -- Rain from Tropical Storm Debby will start to fall on Tuesday afternoon, before bringing even more rain Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is predicting the eye of the storm to sit in the Atlantic Ocean before moving north through South Carolina and into North Carolina this weekend.\n\nAs Debby slowly approaches, central North Carolina will experience rounds of rain and increasingly gusty winds Tuesday through Friday. There's already a high risk of flooding in areas that have experienced rain in the past few weeks.\n\nBeach erosion is also expected at the coast.\n\nThere is a high risk for Raleigh and counties to the south to experience flash flooding.\n\nStorm totals could be 8 to 12 inches in the Sandhills and the Triangle could see 6 to 9 inches by Friday night.\n\nDebby is the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season after Tropical Storm Alberto, Hurricane Beryl and Tropical Storm Chris, all of which formed in June.\n\nState agencies are already preparing for the storm and its impact on the state. Gov. Roy Cooper declared a State of Emergency ahead of the storm -- a move that activates state emergency plans in various industries.\n\n\"This weather has the potential to bring intense rain and flooding to North Carolina and we are preparing for it,\" Cooper said. \"As the weather becomes more severe, I urge everyone to take precautions and stay safe.\"\n\nFlooding and power outages are expected to start Tuesday and continue through the rest of the week, according to North Carolina Emergency Management officials.\n\nWATCH: Special Debby edition of The Weather Show\n\nThe City of Raleigh announced on Sunday that it started lowering Lake Johnson in anticipation of the heavy rainfall from the storm system.\n\nIn Wake County, preparations for Debbie are underway in a community still cleaning up from a natural disaster. In the Woodlands community in Garner - which was rocked by an EF-1 tornado in December - several residents said they're bracing for this week's expected rainfall.\n\nJanice Hedgepeth said the memory of that vicious storm in December is still vivid.\n\n\"Everything was everywhere. And we thought, you know, maybe that was it. A few limbs and stuff. But as we walked around and looked around, neighbor's roofs were gone. It was it was horrible,\" she said.\n\nHedgepeth, who's lived in the community for three decades, said she's endured several hurricanes and always tries to stay stocked with supplies.\n\n\"Ever since we went through Fran, we always take preparations. We always have water and batteries and things like that,\" she said.\n\nMeantime, hardware and home improvement stores in the area are already stocking up on supplies to help with possible flooding and power outages.\n\n\"It's mostly getting things out that they would need before a storm, and making sure we're ready if anything bad does happen,\" said Brian Edwards, store manager at Lowe's in Garner.\n\nEdwards and his team helped in the cleanup effort in the Woodlands neighborhood last year, and he said they're prepared to do the same should flooding or damage occur in the area.\n\n\"We'll get together a team and we'll see where we're needed and what we can do. And, you know, any kind of labor or anything we can do to help out the people around here is what we're going to do,\" he said.\n\nDebby is expected to move eastward back into the Atlantic before heading north up through South Carolina\n\nNorth Carolina officials are also monitoring the storm's progress, as it could turn north after tracking along the South Carolina coast. That change in direction would send the system right through the heart of the Tar Heel state.\n\nForecasters say Debby's biggest effects could be as much as 30 inches of rain in localized areas throughout South Carolina, causing floodwaters to rise quickly in small areas.\n\n\"This storm may not have the high winds of a hurricane, but it has the potential to cause life-threatening floods across the state. And I would like to emphasize that Tropical Storm Debby is not just a coastal event, but it is a statewide event,\" South Carolina Emergency Management Division Director Kim Stenson said at a Monday afternoon news conference.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, flooding rains fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding that nearly knocked Columbia's water system offline.\n\nIn 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.", "source": {"uri": "abc11.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "abc11 News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Raleigh, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Raleigh, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roy Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Chris_(1988)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical Storm Chris (1988)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Alberto_(2006)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical Storm Alberto (2006)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_erosion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coastal erosion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Triangle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Research Triangle"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Power outage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flash flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic hurricane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Fujita_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enhanced Fujita scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pressure_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low-pressure area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_County,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wake County, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wake County, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolinas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carolinas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Florence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Florence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Matthew", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Matthew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowe's", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lowe's"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15149382_GUSdUuUWMAARsOv.png?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792521", "eventUri": "eng-9792521", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Raleigh, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

"MIAMI: At least four people were killed as Tropical Storm Debby drenched Florida on Monday (Aug 5), threatening southeastern US states with heavy rainfall and catastrophic flooding.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died when a tree was blown onto a mobile home in Levy County, the sheriff's office there said, after Debby made landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast earlier Monday as a Category One hurricane.\n\nAuthorities said a truck driver was killed after his 18-wheeler plunged into a canal in Hillsborough County, while a 38-year-old woman and 12-year-old boy died in a car crash in Dixie County.\n\nThe storm moved into Georgia overnight and is expected to go offshore before approaching the South Carolina coast on Thursday, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC).\n\n\"This is a level four out of four risk for excessive rainfall,\" Michael Brennan, director of the NHC, told reporters.\n\n\"This is going to result in a prolonged extreme rainfall event with potential for catastrophic flooding across coastal portions of Georgia, South Carolina, even extending up into North Carolina,\" he added.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis said that some 250,000 residents in his state were without power.\n\n\"Please, be very cautious when you're going out,\" he said, adding that Debby's winds had not been as damaging as previous hurricanes that have hit Florida.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has approved emergency declarations for Florida and South Carolina, allowing for federal assistance in coordinating disaster relief efforts.\n\nDeSantis also activated his state's National Guard, with more than 3,000 service members mobilised to help with storm response.", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Debby is now heading north, where it is expected to do more damage.\n\nThe storm made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane north of Steinhatchee, about 80 miles west of Gainesville. That's just 20 miles south of where Hurricane Idalia hit Florida as a Category 3 storm less than a year ago.\n\nThough Idalia had far stronger winds, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) warned residents that Debby would bring \"way more water.\"\n\n\"This did not bring the catastrophic hurricane-force winds that we've seen in previous storms like Hurricane Ian,\" DeSantis said at an afternoon news conference from the state's Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee. \"But it has and continues to produce lots of water.\"\n\nFour deaths were attributed to the storm Monday. A 13-year-old boy was crushed when a tree fell on the mobile home in which he lived, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office. In Hillsborough County near Tampa, the driver of a semitrailer was killed when the truck plunged into a canal near Interstate 75. Two other people were killed in Dixie County in a traffic accident on slick roads.\n\nEven before Debby hit land, the storm's outer bands were bringing d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu to coastal towns from the Florida Keys up through Tampa Bay. The Sarasota Police Department posted photos of water rushing past damaged businesses. Photos and video shared on social media showed flooding outside stores and restaurants in Fort Myers Beach, which was decimated by Hurricane Ian in 2022.\n\nIn Cedar Key, a number of businesses inundated by floodwater during Idalia had recently begun to reopen. The island community known as \"Clamelot\" is in the Gulf of Mexico and produces most of Florida's clams. Residents were assessing the damage and beginning to clean up once again Monday.\n\n\"They just finished the final repairs on our post office last Friday, and it got flooded,\" said Phil Prescott, a volunteer chaplain for the town's police and fire departments. Cedar Key's only grocery store reopened in March, and he said it also flooded.\n\nBridges over Tampa Bay were closed, as were schools and courthouses in more than a dozen north Florida counties. Early voting scheduled to begin Monday for the Aug. 20 primaries was canceled in several counties as well. Over 195,000 utility customers were without electricity as of early Monday evening, according to poweroutage.us.\n\nOfficials in Manatee County, north of Sarasota, said first responders rescued 32 adults, 12 children and 13 pets from high waters there. Seven coastal counties issued mandatory evacuation orders ahead of the storm for people on barrier islands and in other low-lying or flood-prone areas.\n\n\"We are urging everyone to stay off the roads unless travel is absolutely necessary,\" said Jodie Fiske, Manatee County's public safety director. \"We do not need disaster tourists.\"\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the National Hurricane Center had downgraded Debby to a tropical storm as peak winds decreased to 70 mph. While it's no longer a hurricane, the storm's most dangerous phase lies ahead.\n\nForecasters predict that some of the most serious impacts could come as Debby reaches southeast Georgia and the eastern Carolinas. The system is expected to stall and unleash \"potentially historic\" amounts of rain and \"catastrophic flooding,\" according to the National Hurricane Center. A few areas could see record-breaking amounts near 30 inches.\n\nAt Charleston International Airport, the Weather Service said 2.29 inches of rain had already fallen as of Monday afternoon, breaking a record for the date, with the storm just getting started. Residents were filling up city parking garages to keep their vehicles out of flood-prone areas as rain started to fall. Some roads were already closed, and police warned drivers to avoid floodwater starting to cover some thoroughfares.\n\nMeteorologists have been warning that this hurricane season could be among the most active on record -- and Debby helps back up those predictions. The storm arrived several weeks ahead of schedule, relative to a typical Atlantic tropical cyclone season. On average, the second Atlantic hurricane of the year forms around Aug. 24, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nDebby is the second hurricane to strike the United States this year, after Beryl, which pounded the Texas coast in early July. That is rare by this point in the year; it has happened eight other times since recordkeeping began in 1851, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Philip Klotzbach.\n\nFlorida's Gulf Coast and inland central and northern parts of the state have endured several powerful storms since 2022. Ian struck southwest Florida as a Category 4 storm in September 2022. Over 150 people were killed directly or indirectly because of the storm. Hurricane Nicole slammed the state's east coast two months later. Hurricane Idalia last year resulted in 12 fatalities and an estimated $3.6 billion in damage in the United States, according to a National Hurricane Center report.\n\nFlorida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said Monday that rivers and streams \"are rapidly rising\" and that the impacts from floods and high water will be felt \"for the next five to seven days, even 10 days.\"\n\nSeveral thousand Florida National Guard troops were on standby to help with search-and-rescue operations. Seventeen thousand linemen were also being deployed to help get power restored.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard posted video of a dramatic rescue of two boaters who were adrift 73 miles off the Lee County coast Sunday as Debby whipped up seas as high as 20 feet.\n\nFort Myers Beach was one of the towns hit hardest by Ian. Though the storm surge from Debby was far less -- a little over 3 feet, compared with over 13 feet during Ian -- town manager Andy Hyatt said the storm \"turned out to be a little more than we expected.\" Nonetheless, he said, this time the town was prepared. Cleanup crews were shoveling sand that swamped roads and clearing debris Monday.\n\n\"Thank goodness, knock on wood, we didn't receive much damage,\" he said at an emergency meeting Monday. \"But we do have some cleaning to do.\"\n\n- - -", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The storm, which made landfall in Florida as a Category 1 hurricane, has already resulted in multiple deaths, mass evacuations, and significant damage across Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas.\n\nAuthorities are racing against time to rescue residents from flooded homes, particularly in Sarasota, Florida, and Manatee County, where hundreds have been rescued. The storm's path has brought it into Georgia and is expected to stall, bringing even more rainfall and potential catastrophic flooding to the region.\n\nThe storm has since weakened to a tropical storm but continues to pose a significant threat, particularly to low-lying areas along the Eastern seaboard. As emergency services scramble to respond, the full impact of Debby's wrath is still unfolding.\n\nKey developments:\n\nCasualties: The storm has led to at least 5 confirmed deaths, including a 19-year-old man who was killed in Moultrie, Georgia, when a tree fell on a porch. In Florida, a 13-year-old boy died when a tree fell on a mobile home. Additionally, a truck driver was killed in Tampa after losing control of his vehicle in the storm.\n\nRescues and evacuations: Approximately 500 people were rescued from flooded homes in Sarasota, while 186 were saved in nearby Manatee County. Local officials described the event as unprecedented.\n\nFlooding threat: Record rainfall, with up to 30 inches expected in some areas, has triggered flash flood emergencies, particularly in central and northern Florida.\n\nPower outages: Over 300,000 people are without power in Florida and Georgia, with extensive efforts underway to restore electricity amid dangerous conditions.\n\nState of emergency: North Carolina and Georgia have also declared states of emergency, bracing for the storm's impact.\n\nFlight cancellations: Over 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide, with Florida airports being the most affected.\n\nCharleston curfew: Charleston, South Carolina, has imposed a curfew starting at 11 p.m. Monday due to expected heavy rainfall, with officials preparing for possible severe flooding.\n\nGovernment response: US President Joe Biden has authorized emergency declarations for South Carolina and Florida, and Vice President Kamala Harris postponed a planned trip to Georgia due to the storm.\n\nContinued threat: Debby is expected to continue moving northeast, with forecasted rainfalls of up to 30 inches in some areas. The storm surge and flash flooding remain major concerns as the storm lingers over the region.\n\nHistorical context: Debby's landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida, came less than a year after Hurricane Idalia struck the same area as a Category 3 storm, adding to the region's ongoing struggles with severe weather.\n\nUncertainty ahead: As Debby continues its path, local and federal authorities are urging residents to stay safe and heed warnings, with the full impact of the storm still unfolding.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

EDT Monday morning. This region of the Sunshine State is sparsely populated, so this thankfully prevented widespread structural wind damage from the intense 80 mph storm. However, many coastal locations in the northwestern Florida peninsula recorded 6-10 feet of storm surge as it barreled onshore, inundating homes and businesses along much of the western Florida coast.\n\nDebby has now weakened to a tropical storm with sustained winds of 50 mph as of 4 PM Monday evening. At this time, it was located over extreme north Florida, near the Georgia state line, continuing to slow it's forward speed which only prolongs the impacts heading into the middle and end of this week. Debby is forecast to continue tracking northeast, wobbling off the US coast, and briefly strengthening over the Atlantic Ocean as it slows to a mere crawl near the Carolinas Tuesday through Thursday. It will then move back into South Carolina before gaining speed and heading north toward the D.C. area later this week.\n\nThe overall setup explains why this tropical system will struggle to keep trucking northward. Two strong ridges of high pressure located both to the west and east of Debby is forcing the tropical storm to remain squeezed in between, causing the steering currents to significantly weaken and nearly collapse over the Southeast US. A glancing trough over the Northeast US contains the stronger wind shear needed for Debby to become captured and guided along at a faster speed. Therefore, until Debby can push further north into the Mid-Atlantic region, it will greatly struggle to maintain any momentum and could even stall from time to time.\n\nAs the tropical storm moves back over very warm ocean waters midweek, the lack of wind shear will allow Debby to strengthen slightly, keeping gusty winds in excess of 50 mph and a storm surge threat from coastal Georgia to the coastal Carolinas. Up to three feet of storm surge is expected from Savannah to southern South Carolina. Meanwhile, areas from Georgetown, SC to Wilmington, NC should only expected around a foot of storm surge.\n\nThe most problematic concern moving forward will become the flooding threat as Debby slows down. As it continues to draw in copious amounts of deep tropical moisture from the Atlantic, several inches of rain are expected with widespread catastrophic flooding from Savannah to Wilmington. Many coastal locations from Georgia to North Carolina can expect 10-20'' of rain while a handful of spots receive upwards of 20'' through the end of this week. Although coastal communities will get the brunt of the flooding impacts, many areas further inland, especially the South Carolina low country, will also be at risk for unprecedented flooding. While Debby may not be remembered for the wind and storm surge impacts, the forecast widespread flooding will make this storm go down in history as a prolific rainfall producer.", "source": {"uri":

(WNCN) -- Tropical Storm Debby weakened most of the day Monday, but it also slowed down and that will mean days of heavy rain for North Carolina before the center reaches us Friday. Those days of heavy rain means the threat of flooding later this week.\n\nThe latest information late Monday night from the National Hurricane Center had Debby as a weakening tropical storm with 45 mph winds and only moving northeast at 6 m.p.h.\n\nState of Emergency declared in North Carolina ahead of Tropical Storm Debby\n\nDebby made landfall in the Big Bend region of Florida as a Category 1 Hurricane with winds of 80 mph Monday morning.\n\nHeavy rain from Debby is ongoing across Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. There have also been a few tornado warnings along with gusty winds. Debby is expected to slow down even more over the next day or two.\n\nRain bands from Debby could reach southeastern North Carolina Tuesday, but heavy flooding rain would begin later in the day Wednesday and could last through Friday, especially in coastal North Carolina.\n\nTropical Storm Debby slowly moving towards the Carolinas\n\nIt is looking likely that Debby will move back over the waters of the Atlantic off the coast of South Carolina Tuesday into Wednesday, before making a possible second landfall on the northern coast of South Carolina. The time over the water could allow for the storm to gradually strengthen into a strong tropical storm Thursday. There will be minor adjustments to the forecast path and the strength of Debby, but those small changes will not have a large impact on the final forecast for central North Carolina.\n\nDebby will be a much weaker system when it arrives in Central North Carolina, but multiple days of heavy rainfall will likely result in widespread 2-8 inch totals, with locally higher amounts. The higher rain totals will be in the Sandhills with lower amounts near the Virginia border.\n\nSoils are already saturated across much of the region, so flooding issues are likely, especially in the Sandhills.\n\nNorth Carolina crews clear storm drains, ready equipment ahead of storm\n\nGusty winds could also bring down some trees and powerlines, but those problems are not expected until Friday and at that time, power outages could become an issue in isolated amounts. Forecast wind gusts Friday are expected to be 30-40 m.p.h. with a very low tornado threat.\n\nIn addition to the rain issues, tropical storm conditions are possible along the coast of North Carolina. A Tropical Storm Watch has been issued for a part of the North Carolina coastline from around Surf City down toward the South Carolina border. A Tropical Storm Watch means tropical storm conditions of sustained winds of 39 to 73 m.p.h. are possible within this area in the next 48 hours. A Storm Surge Watch has also been issued for the southern coast of North Carolina as 2 to 4 feet of surge is possible.\n\nFor residents in Central North Carolina, a good hurricane preparedness plan includes having an emergency kit ready. This kit could contain non-perishable food, water, medications, flashlights, batteries, and important documents. It's also wise to have cash on hand, as power outages can make electronic transactions difficult.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

A piece of sky at 68 degrees F can hold twice the amount of water the same piece holds at 50 degrees. As the climate has warmed, that means there is on average a whole lot more moisture above our heads than there used to be.\n\nToday, a bunch of it is coming down all at once.\n\nHurricane Debby made landfall on the Gulf Coast of Florida on Monday, before quickly being downgraded to a tropical storm. But the wind speeds with this particular storm are not the real issue; it's the water. Flooding in Florida is already widespread as more than 10 inches of rain has fallen; at least four people have died in the storm, and more than 230,000 customers in the state are without power.\n\nDebby will now spend the next two days meandering damply across the Georgia and South Carolina coastal regions, dropping an ungodly amount of rain. According to the National Hurricane Center, an area encompassing Savannah and Charleston is likely to see as much as 20 inches of rain through the next few days; a portion of that area may see up to 30 inches fall. In an average August, Charleston gets less than seven inches of rain in the whole month.\n\nThis is, technically speaking, too much rain. Flooding is already rampant in Florida, and it will be worse as Debby moves to the northeast. The NHC gives an entire swath of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, from the coasts to more than 100 miles inland, an \"at least 70%\" chance of flash flooding over the coming days. At a certain point, the water simply doesn't have anywhere to go but up.\n\n\"The heavy rains and flooding currently predicted this week are historic in scope and scale,\" said Kim Stenson, South Carolina's Emergency Management Division director, according to NBC News. The NHC warns of \"catastrophic flooding\" across Georgia and South Carolina. Savannah's mayor wanted people as far away as possible: \"If you don't have to be in these Savannah streets tonight -- don't.\"\n\nSavannah's city manager Jay Melder went on: \"This is a once-in-a-thousand-year potential rainfall event.\" And as far as immediate public health and disaster messaging goes, that's a good thing to remember -- only, it probably isn't, not anymore. What used to be a thousand-year event -- meaning a flood or heat wave or drought with a 0.1 percent chance of happening in any given year in a particular place -- is now something else. Maybe this particular event is down in the 1oo-year event range, or 50-year, or 25. Or if it's still above that today, tomorrow it won't be; warmer air, more water.

A few tornadoes are possible over coastal South Carolina through early Wednesday morning.\n\nIn addition to the southeast, approximately 4 to 8 inches of rainfall with isolated higher amounts is expected through the weekend for Mid-Atlantic States. According to the NHC, this rainfall will likely result in areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, with river flooding possible.\n\nGusty winds will affect the southeast coast through the week with high surf and life-threatening rip currents expected along beaches.

The driver was found dead.\n\nIn Dixie County, just west of Gainesville, officials reported that a woman and a 12-year-old were killed when their car crashed on Sunday night.\n\nIn southern Georgia, another death - a 19-year-old - was reported after a large tree fell on to a porch at a home in Moultrie, local media reported.\n\nThe slow-moving pace of the storm could bring \"catastrophic flooding\", Jamie Rhome, the deputy director of the hurricane center, said.\n\nDebby's waves and strong winds helped blow 25 packages of cocaine, worth more than $1m, ashore in the Florida Keys, according to the US Border Patrol.\n\nIn Florida, some 150,000 homes and businesses were without power on Monday night, according to PowerOutage.com. Another 36,000 residents in Georgia and South Carolina were experiencing outages.\n\nThe storm is forecast to skim the coast, drenching south-east Georgia and the Carolinas on Tuesday and Wednesday, before moving inland near the South Carolina coast on Thursday.\n\nBefore the storm made landfall, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida's 67 counties.\n\nSpyridon Aibejeris told USA Today repairs on his Keaton Beach home had just wrapped up two weeks ago from Hurricane Idalia, a category three storm that made landfall last summer.\n\n\"Man, I've done this so many times,\" Aibejeris said.\n\nForecasters predicted this hurricane season, which runs from 1 June to 30 November, would be a busy one.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) said there could be up to 25 named storms in 2024.\n\nBetween eight and 13 of those storms could develop into hurricanes.\n\nDebby was the fourth named storm of the year.\n\nIt is thought that climate change may be making slow-moving hurricanes like this more likely.\n\nAs the world heats unevenly, this causes changes in the atmospheric circulations that steer storms across the planet. -- BBC", "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "dataType": "news", "title": "Saudi Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

As such, both cities have been placed under a mandatory curfew.\n\nThe storm is expected to slowly move east through Georgia, then swing into the Atlantic ocean by Tuesday. By Wednesday, Debby will turn north and could strengthen before making landfall in South Carolina by Thursday evening.\n\nNorth Carolina will be hit as well, with the storm expected to make an appearance there some time Friday.\n\nAs the storm mostly moves past Florida, over 133,000 customers in the state remain without power as of 1am ET, according to poweroutage.us.\n\nThat number is more than 28,000 in Georgia, a figure that's likely to climb as winds and rain become more intense throughout the morning on Tuesday.\n\nAll of this comes as authorities have released the most up to date death toll from the devastating storm - five people have died so far, four in Florida and one in Georgia.\n\nA 19-year-old was killed in Moultrie, Georgia, after a tree fell on the side of a home Monday afternoon, marking the latest death.\n\nMoultrie is located in south Georgia, around 200 miles south of Atlanta.\n\nA similar tragedy unfolded in Levy County, Florida, where a 13-year-old boy was crushed by a tree that fell onto his mobile home, marking the first life claimed by the storm.\n\nThe second person to die was driving a tractor-trailer near Tampa early Monday. The 64-year-old Mississippi man behind the wheel lost control on the slick road and plunged off an interstate bridge into a canal, according to Florida Highway Patrol.\n\n'The vehicle rotated, collided with a concrete barrier wall along the outside shoulder and traveled over the wall,' the highway patrol wrote in a press release following the incident.\n\n'The trailer came to rest hanging from the bridge while the cab separated and fell into the Tampa Bypass Canal.'\n\nHeartbreaking photos show members of Florida's Hillsborough County Fire Rescue team pulling the truck out of the water.\n\nA 38-year-old woman and 12-year-old boy were also killed in a car crash in Dixie County, Florida, on Sunday evening.\n\nA 14-year-old boy that was also in the car is in critical condition, CNN reported.\n\nWitnesses to the single-vehicle crash told police the car lost control and 'struck the guardrail in the center median, then re-directed, overturning, leaving the roadway to the right,' according to the statement from the Highway Patrol.\n\nNone of three people were wearing seatbelts, police added.\n\nIn Gulfport, a Tampa-adjacent city, a man's body was found by police after witnesses said he anchored his sailboat near Gulfport's Veteran's Park, FOX 13 reported.\n\nThe man hasn't yet been positively identified, but the man on the boat is believed to be 48-year-old Brian Clough.\n\nClough reportedly lives on his boat with his dog, who was rescued by nearby boaters.\n\nSlightly further south in Sarasota, Florida, police and first responders piloted through flooded streets and successfully evacuated roughly 500 people from homes that were underwater.\n\nThe city, which is roughly 60 miles from Tampa, got more than a foot of rain from the storm, more than a month's worth.\n\nThe extreme flooding from Debby has also wreaked havoc on critical infrastructure throughout the state.\n\nOne example came in south Hillsborough County, near Tampa, where a 15 foot section of road completely caved in thanks to a dormant sinkhole being torn open by the gushing water.\n\nOfficials closed the road to traffic on Monday.\n\nDue to Debby's slow movement on land, some areas could be drenched with 10 to 30 inches of rainfall, which will likely worsen cause even more damage to roads, bridges and other key pieces of infrastructure.\n\nAs the situation worsens throughout the south, governors are getting serious about response strategies.\n\nGeorgia Governor Brian Kemp has deployed 2,000 state national guard troops to assist with evacuations and rescues.\n\nRoy Cooper, the governor of North Carolina, a state that hasn't been hit yet, has preemptively declared a state of emergency.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has also approved emergency declaration request from Florida, Georgia and North Carolina, a move that will mobilize relief efforts.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors":

be very cautious when you're going out,\" he said, adding that Debby's winds had not been as damaging as previous hurricanes that have hit Florida.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Sunday approved an emergency declaration for Florida, allowing federal aid to be expedited.\n\nDeSantis has activated the state's National Guard, with more than 3,000 service members mobilized to help with storm response.\n\nBy late afternoon, the NHC said the storm was registering maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph) as it swept over Florida.\n\nStorm surge warnings -- signalling a life-threatening inundation from rising water -- are in effect in parts of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.\n\nDebby was expected to bring \"potentially historic rainfall\" of up to 30 inches as it moved north, the NHC said.\n\nBut it said Debby was weakening after making landfall earlier with sustained speeds of 80 mph (130 kph) as a Category One hurricane -- the lowest on a scale of five.\n\nMandatory evacuations were ordered for part of Citrus County, Florida, with eight other counties under voluntary evacuation orders, local media reported.\n\nPolice in the city of Sarasota said that some 500 residents were evacuated from their flooded homes.\n\nThe governors of Georgia and South Carolina have declared a state of emergency ahead of the storm's arrival.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Border Patrol announced that Debby had washed up 25 packages of cocaine to the coast of the Florida Keys, where they were seized.\n\nThe intended shipment had a street value of more than $1 million, acting chief patrol Agent Samuel Briggs II said on X.\n\nIn July, at least 18 people were killed when the powerful Hurricane Beryl tore through the Caribbean before hitting the southern US states of Texas and Louisiana.\n\nScientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of storms such as Beryl because there is more energy in a warmer ocean for them to feed on.", "source": {"uri": "terradaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Terra Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki",

The storm will continue to weaken, but the main danger now is rain, with as much as 30cm expected across a wide area from northern Florida to North Carolina through Saturday as Debby meanders around the region.\n\nThe waters are set to inundate roads, damage crops and likely drive people from their homes. Some parts of Georgia and the Carolinas may get as much as 75cm before the storm ends, the hurricane centre said.\n\n\"This potentially historic rainfall will likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding,\" according to the centre. \"This will likely result in areas of considerable flash and urban flooding, with significant river flooding expected.\"\n\nThe storm has already cut power to almost 300,000 customers across northern Florida and Georgia, according to PowerOutage.us. It's also grounded more than 1,600 flights around the US, said FlightAware, an airline tracking service.\n\nThe governors of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina have all declared emergencies, and President Joe Biden has approved federal help. In the immediate path of the storm, residents along the coast were ordered from their homes and shelters have been opened.\n\nIf the storm causes widespread flooding across southern coastal states, particularly around Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, it could cause up to $1.5 billion (\u20ac1.37 billion) in destruction and losses, said Chuck Watson, a disaster modeller at Enki Research.\n\nIn 2018, the southeastern US was devastated by torrential rains from Hurricane Florence that killed more than 50 people and damaged infrastructure and agriculture throughout the region.\n\nEven though Debby has lost power, the situation will likely get worse because of how slowly the storm will move through the coastal region, said Tyler Roys, a senior meteorologist at commercial forecaster AccuWeather Inc.\n\n\"Going forward now, rain is going to be the big factor basically for the rest of Debby's life,\" Mr Roys said. \"We're very worried about this rain.\"\n\nDebby is trapped between high-pressure systems to its northwest and northeast, and this means there won't be strong steering currents in the atmosphere to move Debby along, said Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher at Colorado State University.\n\n\"There's certainly going to be catastrophic flooding given how slow-moving Debby is going to be,\" he said.\n\nThe situation will get worse if Debby re-emerges, as is expected, into the Atlantic on Tuesday, because it will be pushing water onshore, essentially blocking rivers from draining into the ocean as the downpours continue inland.\n\nDebby is already the second storm to make landfall in the US this year following Beryl, which struck eastern Texas last month and caused a massive power outage. The Atlantic basin typically doesn't produce its second system with winds of at least 119km/h until August 26th.\n\nWestern Florida in recent years has been battered by storms including Category 5 Michael in 2018 - which was directly responsible for 16 deaths in the US - and Ian, which struck as a Category 4 storm in 2022, leaving more than 160 dead. A year ago, Hurricane Idalia made landfall in the Big Bend area as a Category 3 hurricane.\n\nIn addition to Debby, forecasters are watching an area of unsettled weather in the Atlantic that may push into the western Caribbean later this week. It has a 30 per cent chance of becoming the season's next storm within seven days. - Bloomberg", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [],

On the morning of Aug. 5, the site was bustling with people shoveling sand from depleted mounds and filling up their allotted ten bags.\n\nIt's a sign that locals are taking the warnings from meteorologists seriously. Historic rainfall is on the way and forecasters whom are notoriously judicious in their use of words are using the term catastrophic. Ron Morales, the warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Charleston is one of them.\n\n\"Our forecast is continuing to be 10 to 20 inches of rainfall with the event with isolated amounts up to 30 inches,\" Morales told the Berkeley Independent.\n\nTropical Storm Debbie will churn its way up the coast at an agonizingly slow pace. Morales said models and forecasts over the past few days have all showed there is rain coming and it's not going to stop. Most times a storm will move up the east coast in just a few days but not this one, because there are no currents to move it along.\n\n\"Think of leaf in a river or stream that gets pushed by that stream, well the stream basically disappears and it doesn't push it as it gets to our area,\" he said. \"And so it just starts to meander and wallow around and when it does that it has a whole lot of moisture with it and it just doesn't go anywhere and it continues to rain and rain for just days.\"\n\nToday's Top Headlines\n\nStory continues below\n\nSen. Tim Scott weds Mindy Noce in Seacoast Church service: 'You've made me the happiest man alive' 'Potentially life threatening' rainfall forecast in Beaufort area. Here's how to plan. Tropical Storm Debby could bring 'potentially historic' rainfall to coastal South Carolina Aiken could receive between 6-12 inches of rain from Hurricane Debby. Here's what we know. 'Life-threatening flash flooding': How Tropical Storm Debby could impact the Myrtle Beach area An abandoned 120-foot US Navy ship is stuck in a Johns Island creek. How did it get there? How a former SC mill town is becoming a hot spot for thrill seekers and nature enthusiasts Hicks: 526 isn't just about Johns Island, it's about West Ashley. Opponents hope you don't notice. Debby, Aug. 5: What to know as potentially 'catastrophic' storm moves into South Carolina These Myrtle Beach radio hosts were on the air for decades. They lost their jobs last week.\n\nAccording to data from the NWS the average rainfall for an entire year in the area is about 50 to 60 inches. In some areas, according to forecasters, half of that total could come just days.\n\n\"Ten to 20 inches of rain with up to 30 in some areas is definitely off the charts and that is why we are saying historic, you know, catastrophic levels of rain so it's a serious situation,\" he said.\n\nThe flooding in October of 2015 is considered historic but that event was a long seam of rain pushed over a smaller area. NWS numbers show the one-day total then was 9.25 inches.\n\n\"The situation is very different for the October 2015 event it really only covered the Charleston and tri-county area versus this one which will be in our area from the South Santee River down to the Altamaha River (GA),\" he said. \"Several counties inland in Southeast South Carolina could see these rainfall amounts. We still think the highest probability of getting those amounts would be closer to the coast.\"\n\nMorals said he is not exactly sure when the rain will eventually come to a stop. Some forecasts have it moving out on Thursday others show it raining still on Friday. That is why the South Carolina Emergency Management Division is asking residents to prepare an emergency kit and double check emergency plans.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType":

The National Hurricane Center's projected path shows that it is expected to linger off the coast of the southeastern United States, hovering over Georgia and South Carolina through at least Thursday.\n\nAs a result, the rainfall forecast shows parts of southeastern South Carolina, including the major city of Charleston, are expected to see between 20 and 30 inches of rain over the next several days.\n\nParts of eastern and southeastern Georgia, including Savannah, along with most of the remainder of the east coast of South Carolina and parts of inland South Carolina, could see 16-20 inches of rain.\n\nA small area along the central portion of the Florida-Georgia border, much of southeastern Georgia, east-central and northeastern South Carolina, and parts of southeastern North Carolina, including Wilmington, are expected to receive 12 to 16 inches of rainfall.\n\nNortheastern Florida, including Jacksonville; a slice of southeastern Georgia; east-central South Carolina; and much of southern North Carolina could experience 8 to 12 inches of rain. Rainfall totals of 6 to 8 inches are projected for north-central and northeastern Florida; parts of southern and east-central Georgia, including Augusta; central South Carolina; and southern, southeastern and central North Carolina, including Raleigh-Durham and Hatteras.\n\nSmaller rainfall amounts of 4 to 6 inches are forecasted for much of central Florida, including Tampa Bay; a strip extending across Georgia and South Carolina to North Carolina, including Charlotte; and much of the central, northeastern and northern parts of the state.\n\nSouthern Virginia, including Richmond; portions of western Virginia; coastal New Jersey; and the eastern portion of the Pennsylvania-Maryland border could see similar amounts of rainfall.\n\nAreas that could see 2 to 4 inches of rain are north-central Florida, including Tallahassee; central Florida, including Orlando; central Georgia; most of western South Carolina and North Carolina; much of the state of Virginia, including Roanoke; most of Maryland; all of Delaware; and eastern West Virginia.\n\nBetween 1 to 2 inches of rain are expected in areas of northwestern Florida, south-central Florida, southeastern Alabama, central Georgia, the westernmost part of South Carolina, western North Carolina, eastern West Virginia and the panhandle of the state, along with parts of Pennsylvania, Ohio and western Maryland.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center, a project of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, issued a statement warning that \"potentially historic heavy rainfall\" accompanying Tropical Storm Debby will result in \"catastrophic flooding\" in parts of Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nTropical Storm Debby is projected to continue moving north, arriving in southern North Carolina on Friday. By Saturday, the storm is expected to make its way into Virginia. It likely will have been downgraded to tropical depression status, meaning that its sustained winds are expected to drop below 39 miles per hour.\n\nIn addition to bringing a massive amount of rainfall to the South, storm surges could result in additional damage. According to the National Hurricane Center, \"The combination of storm surge and tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.\"\n\nAreas along the Gulf Coast of Florida from Indian Pass to the Aucilla River could see peak storm surges ranging from 1 to 3 feet. Further down the Gulf Coast, coastal locations from the Aucilla River to Yankeetown may experience peak storm surges ranging from 3 to 5 feet. From Yankeetown to Aripeka, the storm surge could reach 2 to 4 feet. The area of Florida's Gulf Coast, ranging from Aripeka to Bonita Beach, which includes Tampa Bay, may have storm surges between 1 and 3 feet.\n\nAlong the Atlantic coast, from the mouth of the St. Mary's River in the southeast corner of Georgia to the South Santee River in east-central South Carolina, storm surges could range from 2 to 4 feet.\n\nAhead of Debby's anticipated arrival, Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and South Carolina's Republican Gov. Henry McMaster issued states of emergency. President Joe Biden has approved an emergency declaration for the state of Florida that will allow federal assistance to \"supplement State, tribal, and local response efforts due to the emergency conditions resulting from Tropical Storm Debby.\"\n\nThe emergency declaration will provide direct federal assistance to 61 of the state's 67 counties, only excluding the six southeasternmost counties in Florida.", "source": {"uri": "christianpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type":

On Saturday night it began dropping heavy rains in South Florida on the western shores. It battered Naples and Fort Myers before continuing to crawl up the Florida coastline.\n\nThe massive entity is expected to cause some wind damage, but be especially dangerous because of the excessive amounts of rain it packs. Whether winds reach and sustain hurricane speeds or not is not the biggest threat. The significant precipitation draws the concern of meteorologists globally.\n\nThe NOAA National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center issued warnings over the weekend. \"Heavy rainfall will likely result in considerable flooding impacts from the Florida Big Bend region through the size of the storm. Hazardous conditions can occur outside of the southeast Georgia and the Coastal Plain of the Carolinas through Friday. Potentially historic heavy rainfall across southeast Georgia and South Carolina through Friday morning may result in areas of catastrophic flooding. Significant river flooding is also expected.\"\n\nSavannah State is in the bullseye for Debby rain damage\n\nOut of all the HBCUs in the country, the one at most risk from damage from Debby is Savannah State University. Debby is expected to release up to 30 inches of rainfall on Savannah. This would send rivers flooding into all areas of the city.\n\nOne of the major reasons Debby is expected to cause so much rain damage is the slow speed over terrain. Because there are no fronts to push it along, it is meandering across its path. It is expected to sit over Savannah for possibly more than 24 hours. Raining at those levels continuously will quickly saturate the soil and overflow the rivers.\n\nKnown for its popular Riverfront district, this area will undoubtedly be affected even with marginal rain. If the rain causes flooding above two feet, it could be catastrophic to the renowned tourist areas which brings money into the city with its reputation for fine dining and live music.\n\nSavannah's flat topography exaggerates the threat of flooding\n\nThe topography of Savannah in being that it is a relatively flat city, is a recipe for flooding in this situation. The SIAC school has a total enrollment of just under 3,000 students.\n\nSavannah State University Director of Athletics, Opio Marishiki, is monitoring the storm and making arrangements for its aftermath. \"Fortunately for us no student-athletes have arrived for the Fall semester. We had a campus-wide emergency management meeting today and we will continue to be aware of what threats Debby could bring to campus. The first priority is to preserve people, assets are secondary at this point. The excessive rain and flooding is something we cannot control, but we will extend all efforts to make sure that none of our staffers are in harm's way,\" he said.\n\nOther HBCUs could feel dampening effects of Hurricane Debby\n\nWhile there are several tracking models, several of them have Tallahassee squarely in the cone of probability. The Big Bend area of Florida is preparing for possibly its second consecutive year with a direct hit.\n\nThe Florida A&M Rattlers have Mondays off in their schedule. Hurricane Debby is expected to make its way through the city, but no football activities will be taking place. With FAMU sitting so high above sea level, on-campus flooding has never been an issue.\n\nOne of the greatest features of the Al Lawson Multipurpose Center and Teaching Gymnasium, commonly referred to as the Lawson Center on FAMU's campus, is its versatility to be used as a shelter and mustering point during natural disasters. Frequently during hurricanes, the Lawson Center has been ground zero for sheltering students and families. While the Lady Rattlers and Rattlers play games there, it is also a known safe haven for students during storms.\n\nEdward Waters University delays student-athlete return to campus\n\nEdward Waters University, another HBCU, could possibly feel the effects of Hurricane Debby. Sitting just over an hour from Savannah, the rains could damage the flat plains of Jacksonville. With EWU being just miles from the Atlantic Ocean, a churning storm washing water ashore could cause issues for the new fully-accredited NCAA Division-II school.\n\nEWU President and CEO, Dr. A. Zachary Faison Jr., says the school is implementing their plan.\n\n\"We were actually expecting our student-athletes to arrive on today. We were able to get out ahead of this and sent some communications to them on Friday. They are now preparing to report on Tuesday. We've suspended all campus activities for tomorrow. All of our staff and faculty will be working remotely as we are preparing accordingly,\" Faison said.", "source": {"uri": "islandpacket.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Island Packet"},

The slow-moving storm plowed into Florida's Gulf Coast around 7 a.m. on Monday morning as a Category 1 hurricane, making landfall near Steinhatchee about 70 miles (115 km) southeast of Tallahassee, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nWhen the storm struck in the Big Bend region - where the state's Panhandle meets its main north-south Peninsula - it was carrying hurricane-force winds of up to 80 mph (130 kph), but speeds ebbed as Debby pushed over land. At least four people in Florida died in the storm, Governor Ron DeSantis said at a Monday afternoon briefing. Officials said the dead included a 12-year-old girl and a 13-year-old boy. The hurricane center sees Debby crossing Georgia and moving offshore into the Atlantic by Tuesday night, then re-strengthening and making a second landfall, probably in South Carolina near Charleston.\n\nThe center forecast \"catastrophic flooding,\" with some areas along the Atlantic coast receiving 20 to 30 inches of rain by Friday morning. The governors of Georgia and South Carolina have declared states of emergency in anticipation of Debby's damage. \"This is going to be an event that is going to be probably here for the next five to seven days, maybe as long as 10 days, depending on how much rainfall we get,\" said Florida Division of Emergency Management Executive Director Kevin Guthrie.\n\nBy midday Monday, Debby had already dumped eight to 16 inches of rain in some parts of central Florida, according to local weather reports. The 12-year-old girl who died was hit by a falling tree in Levy County, about 40 miles southwest of Gainesville, DeSantis said. The 13-year-old boy died on Monday morning when a tree fell on a mobile home, also in Levy County, the local Sheriff's Office said on its website.\n\nFurther south in Hillsborough County, rescue crews in Tampa recovered the body of an 18-wheeler truck driver who had lost control of the vehicle on Interstate 75 and went into the Tampa Bypass Canal, the local sheriff's office reported. There were no immediate details on the fourth death from the governor's office, and a spokesperson was not immediately available for Reuters.\n\nRoughly 240,000 customers were without power in Florida, according to Poweroutage.us, and flight trackers showed hundreds of flights originating from and heading to Florida airports were canceled on Monday. SLOW DRENCHING\n\nA slow-moving tropical storm as it passed over Cuba, Debby gained strength from exceptionally warm Gulf waters as it paralleled Florida's Gulf Coast on Sunday. Debby bears some of the hallmarks of Hurricane Harvey, which hit Corpus Christi, Texas, in August 2017. Downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved inland, Harvey lingered over Texas, dumping about 50 inches of rain on Houston and causing $125 billion in damage.\n\nClimate scientists believe man-made global warming from burning fossil fuels has raised the temperature of the oceans, making storms bigger and more devastating. The last hurricane to make a direct hit on the Big Bend region was Hurricane Idalia, which briefly gained Category 4 strength before making landfall as a Category 3 in August 2023, with winds of more than 125 mph. The National Centers for Environmental Information estimated $3.5 billion in damages. DeSantis described the initial effects of Debby as \"modest\" compared with Idalia.\n\nForecasters expect numerous Atlantic hurricanes in the 2024 season, which began on June 1, including four to seven major ones. That would exceed the record-breaking 2005 season that spawned the devastating Katrina and Rita hurricanes. Only one hurricane, Beryl, has yet formed in the Atlantic this year. The earliest Category 5 storm on record, it struck the Caribbean and Mexico's Yucatan peninsula before rolling up the Gulf Coast of Texas as a Category 1 storm, with sustained winds up to 95 mph.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"},

Her inching pace has weather and government officials in three states prepared for a multi-day rainfall event of potentially catastrophic proportions.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned that across portions of southeast Georgia, the coastal plain of South Carolina, and southeast North Carolina, 10 to 20 inches of rainfall were expected through Saturday.\n\n\"This potential historic rainfall will likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding,\" the center said in its 5 p.m. EDT advisory.\n\nStorm surge and tropical storm watches have been issued for areas north of South Santee River, South Carolina, to Cape Fear, North Carolina.\n\nNHC's projected track has Debby hovering over Georgia and South Carolina, with the center not arriving over North Carolina until Aug. 9.\n\nThe storm's forecast caused Vice President Kamala Harris to postpone her campaign stop in Savannah, Georgia, which was scheduled for Aug. 9, according to officials with her presidential campaign.\n\nPresident Joe Biden received a briefing on his administration's response to Tropical Storm Debby, a White House official said on Aug. 5.\n\n\"Our administration is in touch with officials from Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, and FEMA has deployed staff to Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina to assist as needed,\" the official said.\n\n\"We urge residents to remain cautious and listen to state and local officials.\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency on Aug. 1 for 54 of his state's 67 counties. The next day, he added seven counties to the list.\n\nPresident Biden approved Florida's emergency declaration on Aug. 3.\n\nSeveral sections of Florida's West Coast have received more than one foot of rain, and more than four feet of storm surge, with reports of severe flooding and multiple confirmed tornados from Collier County to Levy County.\n\nAreas affected included the Charlotte Harbor area and around Tampa Bay.\n\nUp to 10 feet of storm surge was predicted for Debby's impact area of the Panhandle.\n\nThe National Weather Service offices are currently conducting assessments to determine exact statistics.\n\nThe deaths of at least four people, including two minors, have been blamed on the storm as Debby's wind and rain blasted Florida.\n\nThe driver of a semi-truck died after his 18-wheeler veered off I-75 into the Tampa Bypass Canal on the morning of Aug. 5, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office.\n\nThe truck was submerged in 14 feet of water and divers recovered the driver's body from the cab, the agency said in a video posted to X.\n\nFurther north on Florida's west coast, a 13-year-old male was crushed by a tree that fell on his mobile home, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office (LCSO). Deputies responded to the scene at about 8 a.m. on Aug. 5.\n\nDeSantis confirmed two fatalities -- a 12-year-old boy and a 38-year-old woman -- in a traffic accident in Dixie County.\n\nThe governor said about 250,000 Floridians were without power as of Aug. 5, although 450,000 accounts had been restored.\n\nThose still without power include 113,000 users of private utility companies, 111,000 from coops, and 20,000 customers of municipal utilities.\n\nDeSantis and Guthrie said that FDEM had completed 435 storm-related missions, and its teams were proceeding with another 400.\n\nLarge numbers of emergency workers were activated -- including 3,000 members of Florida's National Guard, and 17,000 linemen -- and millions of meals and water bottles readied.\n\nHowever, the governor said he was confident that not all the emergency stockpiles would be necessary.\n\nHe said he and Guthrie will be visiting affected areas on Aug. 6.\n\n\"We will not even scratch the surface of needing to use what was mobilized, and I think that's the way to do it,\" the governor said.\n\n\"We want to make sure that we're prepared for the worst and we hope for the best. You never want to have a storm, but compared to ... Idalia, this one is not leaving the same destruction in its wake.\n\n\"We know there's a lot of water.

Heavy rainfall could cause flooding in parts of the mid-Atlantic through Sunday, the center said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida's Gulf Coast on Monday morning, dumping eight to 16 inches of rain in parts of central Florida, according to local reports. The storm has been blamed for five deaths in Florida and one near Valdosta, Georgia.\n\nNearly 120,000 were without power in Florida as of Tuesday morning, according to poweroutage.us, down from a peak of 350,000 on Monday. Hundreds of flights to and from the state were canceled.\n\nWeather conditions could spawn tornadoes as well, according to the NHC. Cars were flipped and restaurants were damaged in Moncks Corner, South Carolina, early Tuesday morning by a suspected tornado, WCSC-TV reported. Mayor Thomas Hamilton Jr. said there were minor injuries.\n\nThe hurricane center said Debby would slow down and move east and off Georgia's shore on Tuesday before turning north and drifting inland over South Carolina near Charleston on Thursday.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris postponed a presidential campaign stop scheduled this week in Savannah, the Savannah Morning News reported.\n\nSavannah Mayor Van Johnson said the city could expect a \"once in a thousand year\" rain event.\n\n\"This will literally create islands in the city,\" Johnson said.

Officials said the dead included a 12-year-old girl and a 13-year-old boy.\n\nThe hurricane center sees Debby crossing Georgia and moving offshore into the Atlantic by Tuesday night, then re-strengthening and making a second landfall, probably in South Carolina near Charleston.\n\nThe center forecast \"catastrophic flooding,\" with some areas along the Atlantic coast receiving 20 to 30 inches of rain by Friday morning. The governors of Georgia and South Carolina have declared states of emergency in anticipation of Debby's damage.\n\n\"This is going to be an event that is going to be probably here for the next five to seven days, maybe as long as 10 days, depending on how much rainfall we get,\" said Florida Division of Emergency Management Executive Director Kevin Guthrie.\n\nBy midday Monday, Debby had already dumped eight to 16 inches of rain in some parts of central Florida, according to local weather reports.\n\nThe 12-year-old girl who died was hit by a falling tree in Levy County, about 40 miles southwest of Gainesville, DeSantis said. The 13-year-old boy died on Monday morning when a tree fell on a mobile home, also in Levy County, the local Sheriff's Office said on its website.\n\nFurther south in Hillsborough County, rescue crews in Tampa recovered the body of an 18-wheeler truck driver who had lost control of the vehicle on Interstate 75 and went into the Tampa Bypass Canal, the local sheriff's office reported.\n\nThere were no immediate details on the fourth death from the governor's office, and a spokesperson was not immediately available for Reuters.\n\nRoughly 240,000 customers were without power in Florida, according to Poweroutage.us, and flight trackers showed hundreds of flights originating from and heading to Florida airports were canceled on Monday.\n\nA slow-moving tropical storm as it passed over Cuba, Debby gained strength from exceptionally warm Gulf waters as it paralleled Florida's Gulf Coast on Sunday.\n\nDebby bears some of the hallmarks of Hurricane Harvey, which hit Corpus Christi, Texas, in August 2017. Downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved inland, Harvey lingered over Texas, dumping about 50 inches of rain on Houston and causing $125 billion in damage.\n\nClimate scientists believe man-made global warming from burning fossil fuels has raised the temperature of the oceans, making storms bigger and more devastating.\n\nThe last hurricane to make a direct hit on the Big Bend region was Hurricane Idalia, which briefly gained Category 4 strength before making landfall as a Category 3 in August 2023, with winds of more than 125 mph. The National Centers for Environmental Information estimated $3.5 billion in damages. DeSantis described the initial effects of Debby as \"modest\" compared with Idalia.\n\nForecasters expect numerous Atlantic hurricanes in the 2024 season, which began on June 1, including four to seven major ones. That would exceed the record-breaking 2005 season that spawned the devastating Katrina and Rita hurricanes.\n\nOnly one hurricane, Beryl, has yet formed in the Atlantic this year. The earliest Category 5 storm on record, it struck the Caribbean and Mexico's Yucatan peninsula before rolling up the Gulf Coast of Texas as a Category 1 storm, with sustained winds up to 95 mph.\n\n(Reporting by Rich McKay in Atlanta, Gabriella Borter in Washington, Andrew hay in Taos, New Mexico and Tyler Clifford in New York; Editing by Frank McGurty and David Gregorio)", "source":

See the forecast for 10 cities.", "body": "Sorry, a summary is not available for this article at this time. Please try again later.\n\nDebby made landfall Monday morning along Florida's Big Bend as a Category 1 storm. More than 30 million people are under alerts across much of Florida, southeast Georgia and South Carolina for wind, storm surge or flooding, even as Debby transitioned from a hurricane to a tropical storm.\n\nDebby's winds, which gusted as high as 98 mph near its landfall location, will weaken as the storm continues to move inland. However, the storm will transition into a \"potentially historic\" tropical rainstorm with devastating flooding, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nConfidence in the storm's track and impacts through Tuesday is fairly high. As Debby's low-pressure center moves through northeast Florida on Monday afternoon, and into southern Georgia on Monday evening, the heavy rain and flooding will ease along Florida's Gulf Coast but continue around Jacksonville, Fla., and spread northward, reaching Savannah, Ga., and Charleston, S.C.\n\nWind gusts up to near 60 mph are possible across southern Georgia and in central to southern South Carolina, and there could be a storm surge -- the rise in ocean water above normally dry land -- of up to 4 feet in some locations along the Georgia and South Carolina coastlines. Severe thunderstorms and isolated tornadoes are possible, as well.\n\nHeavy rain and flooding, however, remain the storm's greatest threat. Many places could see 10 or more inches of rain through Tuesday. Beyond Tuesday, the forecast becomes much less certain, as models continue to struggle with whether, and exactly where, the storm will stall near the Southeast coast. Some parts of Georgia and South Carolina could end up with 20 to 30 inches of rain, challenging state records.\n\nHere are forecast details for a selection of cities in the storm's path, all of which could experience areas of flooding:\n\nTampa Bay\n\nRain and storms: Periods of moderate to heavy rain, thunderstorms and a chance of isolated tornadoes continue into Monday afternoon and night. Scattered showers and storms remain possible at times Tuesday into Wednesday. Some spots could see an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain, bringing storm totals to around 8 to 12 inches.\n\nFlood threat: Moderate.\n\nWind: Sustained winds at 20 to 30 mph on Monday afternoon, gusting to 40 to 60 mph. Sustained winds should decrease to 15 to 25 mph Monday night, with gusts of 30 to 40 mph. Occasional gusts continue near 30 mph on Tuesday.\n\nStorm surge: Storm surge along the coast could reach 3 to 5 feet through Tuesday morning.\n\nJacksonville\n\nRain and storms: Heavy rain, thunderstorms and possible tornadoes Monday afternoon and night, then occasional showers and thunderstorms through Tuesday night. Storm total rainfall through Tuesday night of 6 to 12 inches. If the storm stalls, then more periods of heavy rain could continue through at least Wednesday, potentially bringing total rainfall to 8 to 14 inches.\n\nFlood threat: Moderate.\n\nWind: Sustained winds at 20 to 35 mph on Monday afternoon and evening, gusting to 35 to 55 mph. Sustained winds should decrease to 15 to 30 mph on Tuesday, gusting 30 to 40 mph.\n\nSavannah\n\nRain and storms: Heavy rain, thunderstorms and possible tornadoes Monday afternoon and night, then periods of rain Tuesday and Wednesday. Total rainfall through Wednesday of 10 to 15 inches. If the storm stalls, then more rain in possible through at least Thursday, potentially increasing total rainfall to near or over 20 inches.\n\nFlood threat: High.\n\nWind: Sustained winds at 15 to 30 mph Monday afternoon through Tuesday. Gusts increase from 20 to 35 mph Monday afternoon to 35 to 50 mph Monday evening through Tuesday. There could also be periods of weaker winds as the calmer eye of the storm passes overhead.\n\nStorm surge: Storm surge of 2 to 4 feet at the coast starting Monday evening.\n\nCharleston\n\nRain and storms: Periods of moderate to heavy rain with thunderstorms Monday afternoon through Wednesday. Total rainfall of 8 to 14 inches through Wednesday. If the storm stalls, then more periods rain could continue through at least Thursday, potentially bringing total rainfall to near or over 20 inches.\n\nFlood threat: High.\n\nWind: Sustained winds increase to 15 to 25 mph Monday night, gusting to 25 to 35 mph. Tuesday winds should be sustained at 20 to 30 mph, gusting to 35 to 50 mph.\n\nStorm surge: Storm surge of 2 to 4 feet at the coast starting Monday evening.\n\nColumbia, S.C.\n\nRain and storms: Rain develops Monday night, occasionally heavy with thunderstorms Tuesday into Wednesday. Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches through Wednesday. If the storm stalls, periods of rain could continue Thursday and possibly into Friday, increasing storm total rainfall to 4 to 8 inches.\n\nFlood threat: High.\n\nWind: Sustained winds at 15 to 30 mph Tuesday into Wednesday, gusting to 30 to 55 mph.\n\nForecast for the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast\n\nWhat happens to the north, in the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast, will depend on the ultimate track and speed of the storm. Models still differ on whether the storm will get pulled northward by the jet stream later this week and how fast. Some suggest it could meander and eventually dissipate over or near the southeastern United States.\n\nIf the storm does come north, these are potential impacts:\n\nRaleigh, N.C.: Rain develops Tuesday and could continue at times through Friday. Near or over 5 inches of rain and moderate flooding is possible depending on the exact track and speed of the storm.\n\nVirginia Beach: Rain develops Tuesday afternoon and could continue, moderate to heavy at times, into Friday night. Around 2 to 4 inches of rain, areas of flooding and a storm surge along the coast are possible.\n\nD.C., Philadelphia and New York: If the storm takes a track up the coast, then the Interstate 95 corridor from D.C. to New York could see periods of moderate to heavy rain Thursday into Saturday, as well as localized areas of flooding. Coastal areas could see flooding, rough waves and dangerous rip currents.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby moved menacingly into some of America's most historic Southern cities and was expected to bring prolonged downpours and flooding throughout the day Tuesday after slamming into Florida and prompting the rescue of hundreds from flooded homes.\n\nRecord-setting rain from the storm that killed at least five people on Monday was causing flash flooding, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) possible in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\n\"Hunker down,\" Van Johnson, the mayor of Savannah, Georgia, told residents in a social media livestream Monday night. \"Expect that it will be a rough day\" on Tuesday, he said.\n\nFlash flood warnings were issued in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, among other areas of coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Both Savannah and Charleston announced curfews Monday night into Tuesday.\n\nPeople are also reading...

No injuries were immediately reported, officials said.\n\nThe National Weather Service continued issuing tornado warnings well into Monday night for parts of the state including in the island town of Hilton Head.\n\nDebby made landfall along the Gulf Coast of Florida early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane. It has weakened to a tropical storm and is moving slowly, drenching and bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across portions of eastern Georgia, the coastal plain of South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Wednesday.\n\nAbout 500 people were rescued Monday from flooded homes in Sarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, the Sarasota Police Department said in a social media post. Just north of Sarasota, officials in Manatee County said in a news release that 186 people were rescued from flood waters.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun said on social media.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that the state could continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" he said. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nFive people had died due to the storm as of Monday night, including a truck driver on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office. In Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night.\n\nIn southern Georgia, a 19-year-old man died Monday afternoon when a large tree fell onto a porch at a home in Moultrie, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.\n\nNearly 160,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday night, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were also canceled nationwide on Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved a request from South Carolina's governor for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he has asked Biden to issue a preemptive federal emergency declaration to speed the flow of federal aid to the state.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris postponed a campaign stop scheduled for Thursday in Savannah.\n\nNorth Carolina is also under a state of emergency after Gov. Roy Cooper declared it in an executive order signed Monday. Several areas along the state's coastline are prone to flooding, such as Wilmington and the Outer Banks, according to the North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding. In 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.\n\nMartin reported from Atlanta. AP journalists Freida Frisaro in Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Kate Payne in Tallahassee, Florida; Michael Schneider in Orlando, Florida; Russ Bynum in Savannah, Georgia; Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina; Darlene Superville and Will Weissert in Washington, and Lisa Baumann in Bellingham, Washington, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

At least four people have died from either fallen trees or car crashes since the storm moved up through the Gulf of Mexico lashing the state with wind and rain over the weekend.\n\nWhat had been a tropical storm most of Sunday formed into a Category 1 hurricane before midnight, and continued to intensify overnight making landfall near Steinhatchee with sustained winds of 80 mph around 7 a.m. Eastern time and reported gusts of up to 95 mph.\n\nThe path fell just 15 miles south of where Hurricane Idalia struck in 2023.\n\nAs of 8 p.m. the NHC reported that Debby, which had reduced its intensity back to a tropical storm by 11 a.m., had further diminished strength as it moved inland with 45 mph sustained winds about 50 miles east of Valdosta, Georgia. It had slowed as well moving northeast at 6 mph. Debby's tropical-storm-force winds extend out 140 miles from the storm's center.\n\nThe outer bands to the east of Debby's center had spawned several tornado warnings across Florida overnight as the storm churned north. Southwest Orange County, including Disney World, fell under a tornado warning Monday, indicated by radar, but no funnel cloud was spotted.\n\nA late Sunday tornado warning was issued in Cocoa, and the winds flipped five campers on their side at an RV park, according to Orlando Sentinel news partner Spectrum News 13. At least one resident was transported to an area hospital.\n\nThe storm had already sent storm surge to flood the coastal areas of cities from Fort Myers north to the Panhandle while much of the west coast endured power outages, downed trees and some structural damage as the storm progressed north on Sunday.\n\nImages posted on social media by Cedar Key Fire Rescue early Monday showed floodwaters rising along the streets of the city, located south of where the storm made landfall. Water was \"coming in at a pretty heavy pace,\" the post said.\n\nDuring a press conference Monday afternoon from the Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee, Gov. Ron DeSantis said the Florida Department of Emergency Management was well prepared to react to the system, which was much less harrowing that 2023's Hurricane Idalia and 2022's Hurricane Ian.\n\n\"We will not even scratch the surface of needing to use what was mobilized, and I think that's the way to do it,\" he said. \"We want to make sure that we're prepared for the worst and we hope for the best. You never want to have a storm but compared to Ian and even Idalia, this one is not leaving the same destruction in its wake.\"\n\nFDEM has already completed 435 storm-related missions, including requests for things like high-water vehicles or pumps, and is in the midst of completing about 400 more, he said.\n\n\"We know there's a lot of water. We know that presents hazards and we'll be ready to work accordingly,\" he said. \"There is going to be damage from the storm. There has been. There will be, but compared to some of the things that I think Floridians have been used to in the last five or 10 years, this is not Hurricane Michael. This is not Hurricane Ian.\"\n\nWhile wind and storm surge were the immediate threat, flooding remains a major concern in the days to come, said DeSantis said during a Monday morning news conference as the hurricane was moving ashore.\n\n\"This storm has produced and will likely produce significant flooding events from Sarasota-Bradenton area all the way up to northern Florida,\" he said. \"There's a threat, ongoing threat of that, over the ensuing days.\"\n\nHe urged at the time for Floridians to remain inside.\n\n\"Don't go out into the storm. Don't drive on the roads, particularly when they're flooded,\" he said noting some traffic accidents already across the state that might be blamed on the hurricane when an official death toll is taken.\n\nOne semi truck, the driver of which was found dead inside the cab of the vehicle, had veered off a bridge into the water off Interstate 75 in Tampa, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. FHP also reported another two-car crash in Dixie County on Sunday night that left two people dead and one person hospitalized stating witnesses said it looked like one of the vehicles had lost control because of a wet roadway and inclement weather.\n\n\"When you have flood situations, that is the No. 1 way where we will see fatalities is by people being out on the roads and hydroplaning or having other problems,\" he said. \"So do not go walk or drive into flooded roadways. There are hazards there. They're dangerous. We want everybody to be safe.\"\n\nAnother death was reported by the Levy County Sheriff's Office, which confirmed a 13-year-old boy had been crushed inside a mobile home that was hit by a fallen tree in Fanning Springs on Monday morning.\n\nThe governor had declared a state of emergency last week to most of the state's counties, and President Joe Biden approved the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate all disaster relief efforts.\n\nThe Florida National Guard has 3,000 service members set for the response efforts along Florida State Guard, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and county emergency response personnel with an arsenal of high-water vehicles and other response equipment.\n\nIt's the fourth hurricane to hit Florida in August since 2000 following Hurricane Charley in 2004, Katrina in 2005 and last year's Hurricane Idalia.\n\nFDEM Director Kevin Guthrie said some places saw 10 to 12 inches in southwest Florida with rivers and streams expected to go into flood stage this week, especially in North Florida where the storm continues to dump torrents of rain on the area.\n\n\"This is going to be an event that is going to be probably here for the next five to seven days, maybe as long as 10 days depending on how much rainfall we get, so we are not running anywhere,\" he said. \"We are staying put and we're going to make sure that we're here to respond.\"\n\nIn an effort to stem any post-storm deaths and injuries, he urged those with damage on their homes to not to try and take care of it themselves.\n\n\"Please do not get up on a ladder. Do not try to put a tarp on a roof. Do not try to cut a limb. We have volunteer organizations that will come and help you with that,\" Guthrie said asking people instead contact their local emergency management agency. \"We will make sure somebody comes and helps you on your property. Do not risk yourself, do not risk injury. We will come and help you.\"\n\nStorm surge was forecast to raise water levels from 6 to 10 feet on parts of Big Bend closest to the storm's center. A tide station in Cedar Key on Monday morning recorded water level at 4.6 feet above normal, the NHC reported.\n\nThe tropical storm and storm surge warnings had ceased for Florida's west coast as of 5 p.m.\n\nA tropical storm warning remains in effect on the east coast from Georgia and South Carolina coast from the mouth of the St. Mary's River to South Santee River in South Carolina; South Carolina and North Carolina coast from north of South Santee River to Cape Fear, North Carolina; St. Augustine, Florida to South Santee River, South Carolina; and north of South Santee River, South Carolina to Cape Fear, North Carolina.\n\n\"A turn toward the east is expected on Tuesday, followed by a turn to the north at a slow forward speed on Wednesday,\" said NHC senior hurricane specialist Daniel Brown. \"On the forecast track, the center will move across southeastern Georgia tonight and Tuesday, move offshore of the South Carolina coast by late Tuesday and Wednesday, and approach the South Carolina coast on Thursday.\"\n\nAs of 8 p.m., about 160,000 customers were without power in Florida, down from a high of more than 300,000 on Monday morning, while more than 26,000 customers were without power in Georgia, according to poweroutage.us, About 11,000 remain without power in Pinellas County, which was lashed all day Sunday by bands from the storm. In Central Florida, less than 100 were without power in Lake County down from more than 20,000 on Monday morning.\n\nDeSantis said power issues are not as bad as Idalia and nowhere near what was seen with 2022's Hurricane Ian.\n\n\"We have a lot of restoration personnel ready to go to get it back on,\" he said. \"We do have 17,000 linemen that are ready to assist with restoring power immediately and I know a lot of the utilities have already restored hundreds of thousands of folks starting yesterday.\"\n\nThe system had grown since becoming Tropical Depression Four late Friday and developing into a tropical storm on Saturday.\n\nThe NHC expects rainfall from 6 to 12 inches with some areas getting up to 18 inches across portions of Florida, and up to 30 inches across parts of the Southeast U.S. this weekend and through Thursday morning that could cause flash and urban flooding as well as some isolated river flooding.\n\n\"This potentially historic rainfall will likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding,\" NHC forecasters said.\n\nThe NHC also continues to track a system in the Caribbean with a chance to form into the season's next tropical depression or storm.\n\nAs of the NHC's 8 p.m. tropical outlook Monday, the tropical wave was located near the Caribbean's Windward Islands with disorganized showers and thunderstorms.\n\n\"Any development of this system should be slow to occur during the next couple of days while it moves westward over the eastern and central Caribbean Sea,\" forecasters said. \"Environmental conditions are expected to become more conducive for development later this week as the system moves across the western Caribbean Sea or the southern Gulf of Mexico.\"\n\nThe NHC gives it a 10% chance to develop in the next two days and 30% in the next seven days.\n\nIf it were to form into a named storm, it could take on the name Tropical Storm Ernesto.\n\nDebby became the fourth official system of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. The others were Tropical Storm Alberto, Hurricane Beryl and Tropical Storm Chris.\n\nHurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, but the height of storm formation runs from mid-August into October.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label":

Verlyn Brock said the man died at the home in the city of Moultrie, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Valdosta, Georgia, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.\n\nThe storm has damaged roofs and downed power lines in Moultrie, Police Chief Chad Castleberry told WALB-TV.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Debby had top winds near 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening as it moved slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns eastward.\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, announces curfew, roads into historic city to be closed\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, officials announced a curfew starting at 11 p.m. Monday for the peninsula that makes up much of downtown and the older parts of the 350-year-old city as some of the heaviest rain from Tropical Storm Debby is expected to fall overnight.\n\nPolice will barricade all eight roads leading into the peninsula and only let essential workers and emergency personnel in or out. High-water vehicles will also be staged to go into the area as needed, Charleston Mayor William Cogswell said at a Monday evening news conference.\n\n\"We need people to make their way out. This is not something you can stay at the bar until 10:45. We need you to take this seriously,\" Cogswell said.\n\nThe mayor said forecasters told him 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain could fall in Charleston overnight.\n\nCity officials will assess the situation early Tuesday and decide how and when to reopen roads and lift the curfew.\n\nNo evacuations planned for now in South Carolina, officials say\n\nState officials don't plan any evacuations in South Carolina for now as Tropical Storm Debby slowly spins toward the state.\n\nLarge-scale evacuations typically bring people inland from the coast, and forecasters say Debby's biggest impacts could be as much as 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain in localized areas throughout the state, causing floodwaters to rise quickly in small areas. So any evacuations will up to local leaders.\n\n\"This storm may not have the high winds of a hurricane, but it has the potential to cause life-threatening floods across the state. And I would like to emphasize that Tropical Storm Debby is not just a coastal event, but it is a statewide event,\" state Emergency Management Division Director Kim Stenson said at a Monday afternoon news conference.\n\nBiden approves request from South Carolina's governor for emergency declaration\n\nThe White House said Monday that President Joe Biden has approved a request from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said personnel from the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard are deploying to the region and are prepared to support recovery efforts.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday ahead of Debby's anticipated rainfall. Flooding and power outages are expected to start Tuesday and continue through the rest of the week, according to North Carolina Emergency Management officials.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis previously had declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida's 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also had made his own emergency declaration.\n\nCurfew announced for Savannah and surrounding county as Debby approaches\n\nWith Debby's winds and rains expected to worsen overnight, officials for Savannah and surrounding Chatham County announced that an overnight curfew will take effect at 10 p.m. Monday and run to 6 a.m. Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPublic works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nFlorida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.\n\nNo deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nMayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island: Don't let your guard down\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nIn saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nPackages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nDebby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nBiden briefed on Debby's progress\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nBig worry is storm surge from Debby\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nHundreds of thousands without power\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\n-- -\n\nThis version corrects the attribution for power outage figures to PowerOutage.us, not PowerOutage.com.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

It caused storm surge risks, tornadoes, and wind damage across much of Florida on Sunday and Monday. However, the hazard that I have consistently focused on with Debby is the potential for extreme rainfall. At the time of writing early Tuesday morning, a dangerous rainfall threat persists for coastal Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina through the end of the work week. Here are three reasons why Tropical Storm Debby is causing such extreme rainfall.\n\nA Reservoir Of Moisture Availability\n\nTropical Storm Debby has a reservoir of moisture available to it. Parts of Florida have received over 15 inches of rainfall from the storm, and there is more to come in the Southeast. To have this part of the conversation, I introduce you to precipitable water or PWAT. It is variable that we use to assess the amount of water available to weather systems. It is formally defined in the NOAA Glossary as, \"The depth of liquid water at the surface that would result after precipitating all of the water vapor in a vertical column over a given location, usually extending from the surface to 300 mb.\" With that context, let's dissect what Ben Noll says in his post below. Noll, a meteorologist with the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand, points out the extreme values of PWAT available to Debby.\n\nNoll said, \"It (PWAT)is very useful toward ultimately understanding how much rain may fall from the sky.... 2 inches are generally considered high; however, with Debby, amounts are expected to exceed 3 inches and even push *4 inches* in some states.\"\n\nExtremely Warm Water\n\nWhy are the PWAT values so high? The water temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico and the western Atlantic are particularly high. The combination of warming climate and the El Nino that dissipated recently left the Gulf of Mexico and other water bodies particularly warm in the Atlantic Basin. Sea surface temperatures in waters that Debby traversed in recent days have been running one to four degrees above normal for this time of year, and this is typically when we expect, from a seasonal perspective, \"hotter\" water.\n\nBasic physics explains why warmer water evaporates faster. A University of Illinois website notes, \"It's true that the rate at which the water molecules leaves goes up quickly as the water gets hotter.... So, the evaporation is much faster when the water is hotter.\" The energy source for hurricanes is latent heat of water. The evaporation provides a source of water vapor that ultimately condenses in the storm. When condensation happens, \"energy\" is released to the storm. A University of Arizona lecture website says, \"Condensing a gram of water vapor to liquid at normal temperatures releases about 60% of the energy that detonating a gram of TNT would.\"\n\nAndrew Dessler is a professor at Texas A&M University. In a May blog entry countering climate misinformation, he reminds readers, \"You don't need any fancy physics to understand why we're so confident that tropical cyclones will produce more rain as the climate warms.... the IPCC says that we are already seeing this.\" He goes on to include statements from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report noting high confidence that climate change contributed to storms like Harvey (2017) and that the rate that rain falls is increasing.\n\nA Slow-moving System\n\nMost storms make landfall and move out. Like Tropical Storm Allison (2001), Hurricane Harvey (2017), and Hurricane Florence (2018), Debby is slow-moving and is even likely to stall for the next couple of days. Why so? Well, it is not a rock and a hard place, but two high pressure areas bookend the storm to the west and northeast, respectively. Debby is kind of stuck with a lack of guidance until the wind pattern changes by the end of the week. For this reason, parts of coastal Georgia and the Carolinas are facing potentially historic flooding. All week, I have focused on the rainfall threat with this storm. Unfortunately, when people hear \"hurricane,\" the category or wind speeds often shape the narrative. Debby will be remembered (and its name likely retired) because of rainfall.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, the National Hurricane Center writes, \"The center is likely to move offshore the Georgia coast later today, but then meander off the coast of South Carolina through early Thursday.\" Strengthening could happen if it moves back over water. By the weekend, Debby will move into the Mid-Atlantic region bringing the \"firehose\" of moisture with it. NOAA forecasters emphasize, \"Potentially historic heavy rainfall across southeast Georgia and eastern South Carolina through Friday will likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding. Heavy rainfall will likely result in flooding impacts from northern North Carolina through portions of Mid-Atlantic States and southern New England through Sunday morning.\"\n\nIn 2018, my University of Georgia colleague Pam Knox wrote, \"Long-time residents of Georgia may remember the devastating floods of Tropical Storm Alberto in July 1994.... rain was so intense that Georgia's one-day rainfall record was set during that storm, with 21.10 inches recorded at Americus for a 24-hour period ending on July 6, 1994, as the storm stalled over the state.\" Sound familiar? In 2007, some of my scholarly work revealed that tropical storms and \"weaker\" hurricanes are often more prolific rainfall-producers. Debby will be no different.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather", "type":

The fatalities include a tragic double-car accident in Dixie County, a fatality in a truck crash in Hillsborough County, and a young boy who lost his life when a tree fell on his family's home in Levy County.\n\nTropical Storm Debby hit land at approximately 7 a.m. on Monday near Steinhatchee as a Category 1 storm, marking the Big Bend region's second hurricane within a year.\n\nWith initial maximum winds of 80 mph, Debby weakened to a tropical storm, changed direction to the northeast, and then proceeded to move erratically across North Florida and Southeast Georgia. The National Hurricane Center warned of the potential for \"catastrophic flooding in some areas.\"\n\n\"We have seen and will continue to see flooding in every part of the state of Florida,\" Gov. Ron DeSantis said during a morning news conference at the state Emergency Operations Center.\n\nDeSantis said as of Monday afternoon, 250,000 customers were without power across the state and over 450,000 accounts have been restored since the storm began.\n\nThe Florida Division of Emergency Management has completed 435 storm-related missions, and they are currently in the process of completing another 400 more, DeSantis said.\n\nDeSantis said the state is ready to make more flooding rescues after the storm passes as waters rise.\n\nHe said Tampa and St. Petersburg ports are closed but are due to open Monday evening and all airports are open.\n\nThe storm is expected to move off the southeast U.S. coast late Tuesday and could come back inland over South Carolina on Thursday.\n\nSteinhatchee is in Taylor County, roughly 90 miles south of Tallahassee. On Aug. 30, 2023, Hurricane Idalia made landfall in Taylor County's Keaton Beach with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph and storm surge of 7 to 12 feet along the coast. Idalia then caused widespread damage as it moved across North Florida.\n\nDeSantis said Debby won't be as devastating, but huge risks remain.\n\nDebby, potentially a historic rainmaker, started pounding the Gulf Coast on Sunday.\n\nState Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said the goal is to restore electricity to 80 to 85 percent of customers within 24 to 48 hours.\n\n\"We're going to tackle it,\" he said. \"It's going to be all hands on deck going in there to get that power restored.\"\n\nGuthrie said more than 35 tornado warnings had been issued in the state, and additional \"tornadic activity\" will occur as the system moves across North Florida.\n\n\"The hazards from this storm will be seen and felt far outside the center of the cone,\" Guthrie said, referring to the cone showing the storm's potential path. \"Flood impacts are going to be felt everywhere.\"\n\nNorth Florida and Central Florida could get 10 to 12 inches of rain, which will cause rivers to flood during the next week, Guthrie said.\n\nPart of recovery efforts will include moving resources closer to the Sarasota Bradenton area, which DeSantis said received \"a significant amount of water.\"\n\nDeSantis said he didn't anticipate the state will \"dent\" the more than 11 million bottles of water and 3 million meal rations available.\n\nOn Sunday, the White House said President Joe Biden had approved a federal emergency declaration to provide assistance. The declaration authorizes the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster relief efforts and cover 75 percent of certain storm costs for counties.", "source": {"uri":

That includes a 12-year-old girl and a 13-year-old boy in Levy County after a tree fell and a 19-year-old man near Valdosta, Georgia, who died when a tree fell onto a porch.\n\nOthers killed include an 18-wheeler truck driver who lost control of the vehicle on Interstate 75, and a 38-year-old woman and her 12-year-old son whose SUV crashed during stormy weather in Tampa.\n\nDebby is continuing to move across Florida, with forecasts expected to hit South Carolina on Wednesday and continuing throughout the week before starting to settle down.\n\nHere's a look at whether it's safe to travel to Florida amidst the hurricane.\n\nWhile travel is technically allowed to Florida, nearly 2,000 flights were canceled in the US on August 5, according to flight tracking website FlightAware.\n\nFloridian airports all reported significant numbers of flight cancellations and delays.\n\nThese disruptions could mean it's likely wise to cancel or change plans to travel to Florida until the storm has passed to avoid getting stranded.

Storm surge warnings are in effect in parts of the three states, indicating \"life-threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline.\"\n\nThe storm will probably cause catastrophic flooding with \"potentially historic heavy rainfall\" when Debby moves northeast across Georgia and South Carolina over the next few days, the NHC said.\n\nBut it said Debby was weakening. The storm's maximum sustained winds were 80 miles (130 kilometers) per hour at landfall but dropped to 65 mph at the 2:00 pm ET (1800 GMT) update.\n\nDebby is expected to dump up to 18 inches of rainfall in parts of Florida, and as much as 30 inches in coastal Georgia, South Carolina, and parts of North Carolina before the week is over, the NHC said.\n\nMandatory evacuations were ordered for part of Citrus County, Florida, with eight other counties under voluntary evacuation orders, local media reported.\n\nThe governors of Georgia and South Carolina declared a state of emergency ahead of the storm's arrival.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Sunday approved an emergency declaration for Florida, allowing federal aid to be expedited.\n\nDeSantis has activated the state's National Guard, with 3,000 service members on standby to help with storm response.\n\nMeanwhile in the Florida Keys, Debby washed ashore 25 tightly wrapped packages of cocaine worth more than $1 million, according to a

Experts expect the tropical storm to produce historic amounts of rain and cause catastrophic flooding from northern Florida to southeastern North Carolina overnight Friday into Saturday.\n\nAlthough maximum sustained winds have now slowed to about 45 mph (72 kph), the storm has devastated much of Florida's Gulf Coast, downing power lines, flooding streets and toppling trees.\n\nCharleston could see more than two feet of rain over the next five days, while Savannah could see its typical summer-long rainfall in the same period, prompting both cities to be placed under mandatory curfews.\n\nThe latest hurricane forecasts indicate that South Carolina could be hit as early as 2:00 p.m. ET on Thursday\n\nDebby's slow movement over land could bring 10 to 30 inches (25 to 75 centimeters) of rainfall to some areas, likely worsening the storm and causing further damage to roads, bridges and other key infrastructure.\n\nThe storm is expected to move slowly eastward through Georgia and then into the Atlantic on Tuesday. Debby will turn north and strengthen on Wednesday before making landfall in South Carolina on Thursday evening.\n\nNorth Carolina will also be affected, with the storm expected to arrive there sometime on Friday.\n\nWhile the storm largely passes Florida, more than 133,000 customers were still without power as of 1 a.m. ET, according to the state. poweroutage.us.\n\nIn Georgia, that number is over 28,000. That number is likely to rise as the wind and rain intensify through Tuesday morning.\n\nAll this comes as authorities release the latest death toll from the devastating storm: five people have died so far, four in Florida and one in Georgia.\n\nA 19-year-old died Monday afternoon in Moultrie, Georgia after a tree fell on the side of a home, the latest fatality.\n\nMoultrie is located in southern Georgia, approximately 200 miles south of Atlanta.\n\nA similar tragedy occurred in Levy County, Florida, where a 13-year-old boy was crushed to death by a tree that fell on his mobile home, the first life lost to the storm.\n\nThe second fatality occurred early Monday morning in a tractor-trailer near Tampa. The 64-year-old Mississippi man lost control on the icy road and plunged off a freeway bridge into a canal, the Florida Highway Patrol said.\n\nPictured: A tree fell on the home of a 13-year-old boy.

FOX 13 reported.\n\nThe man's identity has not yet been established, but it is believed to be 48-year-old Brian Clough who is on the boat.\n\nClough reportedly lives on his boat with his dog, who was rescued by nearby boaters.\n\nFurther south, in Sarasota, Florida, police and emergency workers raced through flooded streets and successfully evacuated about 500 people from submerged homes.\n\nThe city, located about 60 miles (96 kilometers) from Tampa, received more than a foot (30 centimeters) of rain from the storm, enough to last more than a month.\n\nThe extreme flooding in Debby also caused damage to critical infrastructure across the state.\n\nAn example of this can be found in southern Hillsborough County, near Tampa, where a 15-foot stretch of road completely collapsed after a dormant sinkhole was ripped open by flowing water.\n\nOn Monday, officials closed the road to traffic.\n\nBrian Clough, another suspected victim of the deadly tropical storm, is pictured next to his

critical infrastructure.\n\nAs the situation in the south worsens, governors are taking their response strategies seriously.\n\nGeorgia Governor Brian Kemp has deployed 2,000 National Guard members to assist with evacuations and rescue efforts.\n\nRoy Cooper, the governor of North Carolina, a state that has not yet been hit, has declared a preemptive state of emergency.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has

The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters).\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the storm's outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia's largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall.\n\n\"This is unprecedented rainfall,\" said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island's interim city manager. She added: \"We don't know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents.\n\nAngela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island's west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking.\n\n\"I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I'm going to stay as long as I can,\" Thompson said.\n\nFlorida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn't mean the state won't continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south.\n\n\"It is a very saturating, wet storm,\" DeSantis said during a briefing at the state's emergency operations center. \"When they crest and the water that's going to come down from Georgia, it's just something that we're going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.\"\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida's gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east.\n\nNo deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says\n\nThe sheriff of Florida's Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state's northern Big Bend region.\n\nBut Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it's unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said.\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nMayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island: Don't let your guard down\n\nNo evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, one of the state's most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby.\n\n\"We don't know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,\" Perry said. \"If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.\"\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts -- and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. \"If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that's is really key to preventing additional flooding,\" he said.\n\nHilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days.\n\nIn saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains\n\nAs Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city's suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nJim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won't be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors.\n\n\"A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,\" Froncak said. \"So whatever's coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.\"\n\nCity crews spent days ahead of Debby's arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago.\n\nPackages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says\n\nIn the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol's Miami sector reported Monday.\n\nA \"good Samaritan\" found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It's didn't say exactly where the cocaine was found.\n\nVice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nHarris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nHarris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now.\n\nDebby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east.\n\nDebby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports\n\nMore than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there.\n\nNearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers.\n\nBiden briefed on Debby's progress\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday.\n\nThe White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said.\n\nA 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOfficials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland.\n\nA truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below.\n\nEast of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nDebby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues\n\nDebby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 50 mph (85 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was near the Florida-Georgia border and was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to decrease in speed as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state's least populated areas.\n\nForecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning.\n\nBig worry is storm surge from Debby\n\nForecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend.\n\n\"That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,\" John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain.\n\nIn Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week.\n\nHundreds of thousands without power\n\nMore than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don't tempt fate, don't try to go through these flooded streets.\"\n\n-- -\n\nThis version corrects the attribution for power outage figures to PowerOutage.us, not PowerOutage.com.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Another 36,000 residents in Georgia and South Carolina were experiencing outages.\n\nThe storm is forecast to skim the coast, drenching south-east Georgia and the Carolinas on Tuesday and Wednesday, before moving inland near the South Carolina coast on Thursday.\n\nHistoric rainfall is likely to lead to areas of catastrophic flooding, exacerbated by a storm surge along the coast which could leave

and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) said there could be up to 25 named storms in 2024.\n\nBetween eight and 13 of those storms could develop into hurricanes.\n\nHurricane Debby was the fourth named

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with catastrophic flooding and was blamed for at least four deaths, with Georgia and South Carolina next in line as the system rips across the southeastern United States.\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina, and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said. Debby had made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over the gulf coast of Florida.\n\nThe tropical storm was moving slowly across Florida, covering roads with water and contributing to at least four deaths.\n\nA truck driver died on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nAnd in Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night. The Florida Highway Patrol said a 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries.\n\nMore than 300,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up.\"\n\nAirports were also affected. More than 1,600 flights had been canceled nationwide; many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday. Nearly 30% of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport were canceled.\n\nSarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, was one of the hardest-hit by flooding.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" said Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun in a social media update.\n\nThe storm made landfall early Monday morning near Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nTaylor County, where Steinhatchee is located, closed several roads due to flooding, Sheriff Wayne Padgett said. Trees and power lines had also fallen across some roads. Padgett advised anyone who evacuated from low-lying or coastal areas to wait before returning to their homes because the tide had not come in, and it was unclear how deep flood waters might get later.\n\nLooking out over the Steinhatchee River from the condo above the marina he operates, Chris Williams said he was feeling blessed that the damage wasn't worse. Williams said his power went out at about 5:30 a.m. Monday as the storm was washing ashore, jamming the dock-studded riverfront with tree debris and barrels.\n\nThe small community is roughly 20 miles (32 kilometers) from where Hurricane Idalia crashed ashore less than a year ago.\n\n\"Two in less than a year is pretty bad,\" Williams said. \"You do everything you can possibly do to prepare. And when you've done that, clean up and put it back together and move forward.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has postponed a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby. Harris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nOn Monday, local leaders in Savannah said flooding could happen in areas that don't usually get high water if Debby stalls out over the city.\n\n\"This type of rain hovering over us, coming with the intensity that they tell us it is coming, it's going to catch a whole lot of people by surprise,\" said Chatham County Chairman Chester Ellis.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.\n\nThe city of Charleston has an emergency plan in place that includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding.\n\nIn 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.\n\nIn Savannah, Jim Froncak piled sandbags into his pickup truck on Monday, as rain was already falling. He said a recent thunderstorm caused so much flooding that he and a friend were able to kayak down a street.\n\n\"That was just a thunderstorm,\" he said. \"So, who knows what could happen with this?\"\n\nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedin", "source": {"uri": "wccbcharlotte.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WCCB Charlotte's CW"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_hale@wccbcharlotte.com", "name":

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby slammed Florida with catastrophic flooding and was blamed for at least four deaths, with Georgia and South Carolina next in line as the system rips across the southeastern United States.\n\nRecord-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina, and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said. Debby had made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over the gulf coast of Florida.\n\nThe tropical storm was moving slowly across Florida, covering roads with water and contributing to at least four deaths.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nA truck driver died on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over the edge before the cab dropped into the water below. Sheriff's office divers located the driver, a 64-year-old man from Mississippi, in the cab 40 feet (12 meters) below the surface, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nA 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\nAnd in Dixie County, just east of where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and 12-year-old boy died in a car crash on wet roads Sunday night. The Florida Highway Patrol said a 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries.\n\nMore than 300,000 customers remained without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that's hazardous,\" DeSantis said. \"Don't try to drive through this. We don't want to see traffic fatalities adding up.\"\n\nAirports were also affected. More than 1,600 flights had been canceled nationwide; many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday. Nearly 30% of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport were canceled.\n\nSarasota, Florida, a beach city popular with tourists, was one of the hardest-hit by flooding.\n\n\"Essentially we've had twice the amount of the rain that was predicted for us to have,\" said Sarasota County Fire Chief David Rathbun in a social media update.\n\nThe storm made landfall early Monday morning near Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida of less than 1,000 residents.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTaylor County, where Steinhatchee is located, closed several roads due to flooding, Sheriff Wayne Padgett said. Trees and power lines had also fallen across some roads. Padgett advised anyone who evacuated from low-lying or coastal areas to wait before returning to their homes because the tide had not come in, and it was unclear how deep flood waters might get later.\n\nLooking out over the Steinhatchee River from the condo above the marina he operates, Chris Williams said he was feeling blessed that the damage wasn't worse. Williams said his power went out at about 5:30 a.m. Monday as the storm was washing ashore, jamming the dock-studded riverfront with tree debris and barrels.\n\nThe small community is roughly 20 miles (32 kilometers) from where Hurricane Idalia crashed ashore less than a year ago.\n\n\"Two in less than a year is pretty bad,\" Williams said. \"You do everything you can possibly do to prepare. And when you've done that, clean up and put it back together and move forward.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed on Debby's progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has postponed a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby. Harris' campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm.\n\nOn Monday, local leaders in Savannah said flooding could happen in areas that don't usually get high water if Debby stalls out over the city.\n\n\"This type of rain hovering over us, coming with the intensity that they tell us it is coming, it's going to catch a whole lot of people by surprise,\" said Chatham County Chairman Chester Ellis.\n\nIn South Carolina, Charleston County Interim Emergency Director Ben Webster called Debby a \"historic and potentially unprecedented event\" three times in a 90-second briefing Monday morning.\n\nThe city of Charleston has an emergency plan in place that includes sandbags for residents, opening parking garages so residents can park their cars above floodwaters and an online mapping system that shows which roads are closed due to flooding.\n\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina have dealt with three catastrophic floods from tropical systems in the past nine years, all causing more than $1 billion in damage.\n\nIn 2015, rainfall fed by moisture as Hurricane Joaquin passed well offshore caused massive flooding.\n\nIn 2016, flooding from Hurricane Matthew caused 24 deaths in the two states and rivers set record crests. Those records were broken in 2018 with Hurricane Florence, which set rainfall records in both Carolinas, flooded many of the same places and was responsible for 42 deaths in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina.\n\nIn Savannah, Jim Froncak piled sandbags into his pickup truck on Monday, as rain was already falling. He said a recent thunderstorm caused so much flooding that he and a friend were able to kayak down a street.\n\n\"That was just a thunderstorm,\" he said. \"So, who knows what could happen with this?\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to correct that the Big Bend area is north of Tampa, not south of Tampa.\n\n___\n\nMartin reported from Atlanta.

Forecasters reported \"major flood potential\" on the St. Marys, Suwannee, Alapaha and Santa Fe rivers, and said Clay County's Black Creek \"could quickly rise into flood.\"\n\nRiver flooding could begin as soon as Tuesday and \"persist for weeks,\" a weather service message said.\n\nThe storm was previously predicted to bring 6 to 12 inches of rain to Northeast Florida.\n\nDebby was blamed for the deaths of four people. Two Crawfordville residents, a 38-year old woman and a 12-year-old boy, were killed in a traffic crash Sunday night in Dixie County, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. A truck driver in Hillsborough County died after his truck veered into a canal, and a 13-year-old boy was killed after a tree fell on his mobile home.\n\n\"Right now in the Steinhatchee area, the water is severely high and it is still continuing to rise,\" Gina Deeson, a spokeswoman for Taylor County Emergency Management. said Monday.\n\nAmong the hardest hit areas were Taylor County, which saw between 8 and 12 inches of rain, and Madison and Lafayette counties, which saw between 6 to 10 inches of rain. Those totals were expected to increase over the day as Debby made an agonizingly slow exit into South Georgia.\n\nThe Taylor County Sheriff's Office asked people to stay off the roads because of the large number of downed trees and power lines.\n\n\"Please don't put yourself at risk,\" the Sheriff's Office said.\n\nThe storm made a ghost town of Perry as residents hunkered down and businesses closed. Spyridon Aibejeris rode the storm out in the same Perry hotel where he waited out Idalia, which made landfall Aug. 30, 2023, near Keaton Beach. He said said repairs on his house in Keaton Beach were finished just two weeks ago.\n\n\"Man, I've done this so many times,\" he said. \"You just go back and see what you've got to do. I hope I don't have to go back to that again.\"\n\nKristian Oliver, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Tallahassee, said that after making landfall, Debby got stuck between two high pressure systems, which kept the rain falling for hours over North Florida.\n\n\"It's just pulling in moisture from the Gulf, which just keeps forming more rain,\" Oliver said. \"That's what makes it relatively unusual, because the steering patterns don't usually break down like this to where it comes to a halt.\"\n\nDebby packed plenty of bluster, with wind gusts of 70 mph measured in the small town of Mayo and a 65 mph gust in Madison County. At the coast, winds gusted to 54 mph at Alligator Point, 50 mph at St. Marks Lighthouse and 66 mph at Cedar Key.", "source": {"uri": "eu.jacksonville.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Treasure Coast

At least four people have died from either fallen trees or car crashes since the storm moved up through the Gulf of Mexico lashing the state with wind and rain over the weekend.\n\nWhat had been a tropical storm most of Sunday formed into a Category 1 hurricane before midnight, and continued to intensify overnight, making landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida, with sustained winds of 80 mph around 7 a.m. Eastern time.\n\nThe NHC had reported a wind gust at the time of 95 mph at a weather station on nearby Horseshoe Beach. The path fell just 15 miles south of where Hurricane Idalia struck in 2023.\n\nAs of 2 p.m. the NHC reported Debby, which fell back to a tropical storm by 11 a.m., had further reduced in intensity as it moved inland, with 65 mph sustained winds about 10 miles northwest of Live Oak, Florida, moving north-northeast at 7 mph. Debby's tropical-storm-force winds extend out 140 miles from the storm's center. A gust of 54 mph was recorded before 11 a.m. in Live Oak, and a gust of 48 mph in Jacksonville.\n\nThe outer bands to the east of Debby's center had spawned several tornado warnings across Florida overnight as the storm churned north. South Orange County including Disney World fell under a tornado warning on Monday, indicated by radar, but no funnel cloud was spotted.\n\nA late Sunday tornado warning was issued in Cocoa, Florida, and the winds flipped five campers on their side at an RV park, according to Orlando Sentinel news partner Spectrum News 13. At least one resident was transported to an area hospital.\n\nThe storm had already sent storm surge to flood the coastal areas of cities from Fort Myers north to the Panhandle, while much of the west coast endured power outages, downed trees and some structural damage as the storm progressed north on Sunday.\n\nImages posted on social media by Cedar Key Fire Rescue early Monday showed floodwaters rising along the streets of the city, located south of where the storm made landfall. Water was \"coming in at a pretty heavy pace,\" the post said.\n\nWhile wind and storm surge are an immediate threat, flooding remains a major concern in the days to come, said Gov. Ron DeSantis during a Monday morning press conference from the Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee. He is slated to give another press conference at 3:30 p.m.\n\n\"This storm has produced and will likely produce significant flooding events from Sarasota-Bradenton area all the way up to northern Florida,\" he said. \"There's a threat, ongoing threat of that, over the ensuing days.\"\n\nHe urged Floridians to remain inside.\n\n\"Don't go out into the storm. Don't drive on the roads, particularly when they're flooded,\" he said noting some traffic accidents already across the state that might be blamed on the hurricane when an official death toll is taken.\n\nOne semi truck, the driver of which was found dead inside the cab of the vehicle, had veered off a bridge into the water off Interstate 75 in Tampa, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. FHP also reported another two-car crash in Dixie County on Sunday night that left two people dead and one person hospitalized, stating witnesses said it looked like one of the vehicles had lost control because of a wet roadway and inclement weather.\n\n\"When you have flood situations, that is the number one way where we will see fatalities is by people being out on the roads and hydroplaning or having other problems,\" he said. \"So do not go walk or drive into flooded roadways. There are hazards there. They're dangerous. We want everybody to be safe.\"\n\nAnother death was reported by the Levy County Sheriff's Office, which confirmed a 13-year-old boy had been crushed inside a mobile home that was hit by a fallen tree in Fanning Springs, Florida, on Monday morning.\n\nThe governor had declared a state of emergency last week for most of the state's counties, and President Biden approved the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate all disaster relief efforts.\n\nThe Florida National Guard has 3,000 service members set for the response efforts along with the Florida State Guard, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and county emergency response personnel with an arsenal of high-water vehicles and other emergency-response equipment.\n\nIt's the fourth hurricane to hit Florida in August since 2000, following Hurricane Charley in 2004, Katrina in 2005 and last year's Hurricane Idalia.\n\nFlorida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said some places in southwest Florida have already seen 10 to 12 inches, with rivers and streams expected to go into flood stage.\n\n\"This is going to be an event that is going to be probably here for the next five to seven days, maybe as long as 10 days depending on how much rainfall we get, so we are not running anywhere,\" he said. \"We are staying put and we're going to make sure that we're here to respond.\"\n\nHe said first responders have access to 600,000 gallons of fuel across six fuel depots, while the state has 850 debris disaster management sites for cleanup.\n\nIn an effort to stem any post-storm deaths and injuries, he urged those with damage on their homes to not to try and take care of it themselves.\n\n\"Please do not get up on a ladder. Do not try to put a tarp on a roof. Do not try to cut a limb. We have volunteer organizations that will come and help you with that,\" Guthrie said asking people instead contact their local emergency management agency. \"We will make sure somebody comes and helps you on your property. Do not risk yourself do not risk injury. We will come and help you.\"\n\nStorm surge was forecast to raise water levels from 6-10 feet on parts of Big Bend closest to the storm's center. A tide station in Cedar Key on Monday morning recorded water level at 4.6 feet above normal, the NHC reported.\n\nA tropical storm warning remains in effect for the Florida coast from Indian Pass down to Aripeka, which is north of Tampa, and on the east coast from St. Augustine north to the South Santee River, South Carolina. A storm surge warning is in effect from the Florida coast from Aripeka north to the Aucilla River and on the Georgia and South Carolina coast from the mouth of the St. Mary's River to the South Santee River.\n\n\"A gradual decrease in forward speed with a turn toward the east is expected later today and Tuesday,\" said NHC senior hurricane specialist Richard Pasch. \"On the forecast track, the center will move across southeastern Georgia tonight and Tuesday, and move offshore of the South Carolina coast by late Tuesday and Wednesday. ... Additional weakening is forecast through late Tuesday. Some restrengthening is possible on Wednesday.\"\n\nAs of 3 p.m., more than 245,000 customers are without power in Florida, down from a high of more than 300,000, and more than 25,000 in Georgia, according to poweroutage.us, More than 18,000 remain without power in Pinellas County, which was lashed all day Sunday by bands from the storm. In Central Florida, more than 3,000 were without power in Lake County down from more than 20,000 on Monday morning.\n\nDeSantis said power issues are not as bad as Idalia and nowhere near what was seen with 2022's Hurricane Ian.\n\n\"We have a lot of restoration personnel ready to go to get it back on,\" he said. \"We do have 17,000 linemen that are ready to assist with restoring power immediately and I know a lot of the utilities have already restored hundreds of thousands of folks starting yesterday.\"\n\nLake County was under a flood watch, having already seen from 1-2.5 inches of rain and up to 3 more inches forecast through 8 a.m. Monday.\n\nThe NWS said additional rainfall of 2-5 inches was expected especially northwest of Interstate 4, with areas southeast to get up to 2 inches. Localized flooding is possible, the NWS said.\n\nThe system had grown since becoming Tropical Depression Four late Friday and developing into a tropical storm on Saturday.\n\nThe NHC expects rainfall from 6 to 12 inches with some areas getting up to 18 inches across portions of Florida, and up to 30 inches across parts of the Southeast U.S. this weekend and through Thursday morning that could cause flash and urban flooding as well as some isolated river flooding.\n\n\"This potentially historic rainfall will likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding,\" NHC forecasters said.\n\nAlso on Sunday, the NHC began tracking a new system with a chance to form into the season's next tropical depression or storm.\n\nAs of the NHC's 2 p.m. tropical outlook Monday, the tropical wave was located near the Caribbean's Windward Islands with disorganized showers and thunderstorms.\n\n\"Any development of this system should be slow to occur during the next couple of days while the system moves westward over the eastern Caribbean Sea,\" forecasters said. \"Environmental conditions are expected to become more conducive for development later this week as the system moves across the western Caribbean Sea or the southern Gulf of Mexico.\"\n\nThe NHC gives it a 10% chance to develop in the next two days and 30% in the next seven days.\n\nIf it were to form into a named storm, it could take on the name Tropical Storm Ernesto.\n\nTropical Storm Debby became the fourth official system of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. The others were Tropical Storm Alberto, Hurricane Beryl and Tropical Storm Chris.\n\nHurricane season runs from June 1-Nov. 30, but the height of storm formation runs from mid-August into October.",

Forecasters reported \"major flood potential\" on the St. Marys, Suwannee, Alapaha and Santa Fe rivers, and said Clay County's Black Creek \"could quickly rise into flood.\"\n\nRiver flooding could begin as soon as Tuesday and \"persist for weeks,\" a weather service message said.\n\nThe storm was previously predicted to bring 6 to 12 inches of rain to Northeast Florida.\n\nDebby was blamed for the deaths of four people. Two Crawfordville residents, a 38-year old woman and a 12-year-old boy, were killed in a traffic crash Sunday night in Dixie County, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. A truck driver in Hillsborough County died after his truck veered into a canal, and a 13-year-old boy was killed after a tree fell on his mobile home.\n\n\"Right now in the Steinhatchee area, the water is severely high and it is still continuing to rise,\" Gina Deeson, a spokeswoman for Taylor County Emergency Management. said Monday.\n\nAmong the hardest hit areas were Taylor County, which saw between 8 and 12 inches of rain, and Madison and Lafayette counties, which saw between 6 to 10 inches of rain. Those totals were expected to increase over the day as Debby made an agonizingly slow exit into South Georgia.\n\nThe Taylor County Sheriff's Office asked people to stay off the roads because of the large number of downed trees and power lines.\n\n\"Please don't put yourself at risk,\" the Sheriff's Office said.\n\nThe storm made a ghost town of Perry as residents hunkered down and businesses closed. Spyridon Aibejeris rode the storm out in the same Perry hotel where he waited out Idalia, which made landfall Aug. 30, 2023, near Keaton Beach. He said said repairs on his house in Keaton Beach were finished just two weeks ago.\n\n\"Man, I've done this so many times,\" he said. \"You just go back and see what you've got to do. I hope I don't have to go back to that again.\"\n\nKristian Oliver, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Tallahassee, said that after making landfall, Debby got stuck between two high pressure systems, which kept the rain falling for hours over North Florida.\n\n\"It's just pulling in moisture from the Gulf, which just keeps forming more rain,\" Oliver said. \"That's what makes it relatively unusual, because the steering patterns don't usually break down like this to where it comes to a halt.\"\n\nDebby packed plenty of bluster, with wind gusts of 70 mph measured in the small town of Mayo and a 65 mph gust in Madison County. At the coast, winds gusted to 54 mph at Alligator Point, 50 mph at St. Marks Lighthouse and 66 mph at Cedar Key.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

Three hours north, in Dixie County, a driver lost control due to the weather, killing a 28-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy. A 13-year-old boy was also seriously injured.\n\nThe Atlanta area will stay mostly dry Monday despite a few scattered showers and storms. It's a very different story farther south. The storm's track is pushing it over South Georgia and toward the East Coast, where between 10 to 20 inches of rain are anticipated. That is in addition to several inches of rainfall that some areas have already seen in July.\n\n\"We have one farm in my area that had 21 inches of rain in July alone,\" said state Sen. Russ Goodman, a South Georgia farmer. \"Whoever has been praying for rain can stop now.\"\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp has issued a state of emergency that will be in effect through Thursday due to the threat of historic rainfall with the slow-moving storm. On Monday, Kemp signed an emergency order authorizing the call-up of as many as 2,000 Georgia National Guard troops.\n\n\"The big story with this is this thing is going to slam on the brakes,\" WSB-TV meteorologist Brian Monahan said. \"It's not going to move, and that is not good with tropical systems.\"\n\nOn Sunday night, the storm registered 75 mph, upgrading it from a tropical storm to a hurricane at that point, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nDangerous storm surge conditions are expected along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts through the middle of the week, the NWS warns. Flash flooding is also expected along those coastlines.\n\nThe flooding, along with strong winds, will bring down trees and power lines, causing the potential for extended outages.\n\n\"Get out,\" Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency Director Chris Stallings said during a news conference Sunday evening.\n\n\"Get you and your family out ahead of time ... Just because the system isn't a hurricane doesn't mean that it's not going to be impactful. Some of our most impactful floods have been tropical storms and tropical depressions here in Georgia,\" he added.\n\nMotorists should avoid driving into water that appears shallow. The water can be much deeper than expected, and currents could be swift enough to sweep vehicles from the road.\n\n\"This is a life-threatening situation,\" the Hurricane Center warned. \"Persons located within these areas should take all necessary actions to protect life and property from rising water and the potential for other dangerous conditions.\"\n\nAs a result of the storm, Vice President Kamala Harris postponed her rally Friday in Savannah. She was set to headline with her yet-to-be-named running mate, part of a four-day swing through several battleground states.\n\nIt is the second time in less than a year that Valdosta and surrounding areas were expecting hurricane or tropical storm conditions. Hurricane Idalia brought damaging winds and flooding to the area last year.\n\nAs the core of Debby chugged toward Valdosta, there were moderate gusts of wind and rain. Locals like Jared O'Neal, whose power is out and whose home suffered $50,000 in damage last year during Idalia, were buying generators. The Lowe's store on St. Augustine Road sold around 30 of them Monday morning.\n\n\"There is still a possibility to see some flooding rains with a total of 10 to 15 inches, which is what was forecasted,\" Meghan Barwick, spokesperson for the Lowndes County Emergency Management Agency, said Monday afternoon. \"We're still heavy winds and some gusts. We've got power lines down, trees down. Nothing like Hurricane Idalia, but we still want our folks to be vigilant and stay off the roads and at home if they can. We haven't gotten reports of extensive damage with trees through houses like we did with Idalia.\"\n\nThe Lowndes EMA estimated that about 25,000 people were without power early Monday afternoon.\n\nIn St. Simons, pounding rain and strong winds kept tourists and fisherman away from the main pier and nearby shops and restaurants Monday. Beaches were also deserted as residents and visitors still on the island prepared to hunker down.\n\nThe F.J. Torras Causeway, which connects Brunswick to St. Simons Island, remains open. According to a joint emergency declaration from Glynn County and Brunswick City commissioners, the causeway will remain open unless there are water hazards and flooding. The Sidney Lanier Bridge will remain open unless wind speeds reach 40 mph sustained. Any decision to close the bridge will be made by the Georgia Department of Transportation.\n\nWhile numerous restaurants on St. Simons Island are typically closed on Mondays, Southern Soul BBQ and sister eatery Frosty's operate seven days a week. However, co-owner Griffin Bufkin opted to shut both of his restaurants Monday.\n\n\"The past three hurricanes that have come at us have done this behind the Gulf thing coming at us from the west. The part that really is the most dangerous is the nor'easter that comes with it,\" Bufkin said.\n\nAirlines have canceled hundreds of flights, including routes to and from cities in Florida. There were about 125 flights canceled at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport Monday, according to FlightAware.com. That includes more than 70 Delta Air Lines and Delta Connection flights.\n\nDelta issued a travel waiver for Fort Myers, Gainesville, Jacksonville, Key West, Sarasota, Tallahassee and Tampa, as well as Valdosta. It is allowing people who had flights booked to, from or through those cities over the weekend through Monday to reschedule their flights to avoid the impact of the storm without paying a higher fare, subject to certain conditions.\n\nJoe Marinelli, president and CEO of Visit Savannah, the local convention and visitors bureau, said one saving grace of the storm impact is that it will hit the area during the early part of the week -- a slower period for tourism, with no citywide conventions in town. Marinelli said he didn't want to discourage people from visiting later in the week or next weekend.\n\n\"It will have some impact on those that were maybe planning to come into Savannah a couple days early (before the weekend) ... but you know, this too shall pass,\" he said.\n\nMarinelli said he suspects some restaurants, tour operators and museums may close Tuesday and Wednesday, but he was not aware of any hotels in Savannah relocating guests.\n\nMarinelli said on Monday morning: \"It's raining right now, but nothing more than a normal rain. ... The concern is that it's going to rain nonstop for three days.\"\n\n_____\n\n(Atlanta Journal-Constitution staff writers Kelly Yamanouchi and Ligaya Figueras contributed to this article.)\n\n_____",

It has now been downgraded to a tropical storm but has already claimed at least four lives, and its impact will be felt for several more days, including in Georgia.\n\nThe eye of the storm reached land in Steinhatchee, Florida, at 7 a.m. Eastern time, according to the National Hurricane Center. An hour later, Levy County Sheriff's Office deputies got a call about a tree that had fallen onto a mobile home, crushing a 13-year-old boy in the small Gulf Coast town of Fanning Springs.\n\nAlso in Florida, a semi-truck driver was killed when his vehicle went into a canal in the Tampa area. Three hours north, in Dixie County, a driver lost control due to the weather, killing a 28-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy. A 13-year-old boy was also seriously injured.\n\nHere in metro Atlanta, we'll stay mostly dry Monday. This afternoon, we can expect a few scattered showers and storms. Temperatures won't be as high as they've been for the past week, either. Today's high will top out in the upper 80s.\n\nIt's a very different story further south. The storm's track is pushing it over South Georgia and toward the East Coast, where between 10 to 20 inches of rain are anticipated.That is in addition to several inches of rainfall that some areas have already seen in July.\n\n\"We have one farm in my area that had 21 inches of rain in July alone,\" said state Sen. Russ Goodman, a South Georgia farmer. \"Whoever has been praying for rain can stop now.\"\n\nGov. Brian Kemp has issued a state of emergency that will be in effect through Thursday due to the threat of historic rainfall with the slow-moving storm. On Monday, Kemp signed an emergency order authorizing the call-up of as many as 2,000 Georgia National Guard troops.\n\n\"The big story with this is this thing is going to slam on the brakes,\" Channel 2 Action News meteorologist Brian Monahan said. \"It's not going to move, and that is not good with tropical systems.\"\n\nLocally, the main impact will be the wind, Monahan said. Over the next couple of days, we can expect gusts up to 30 mph.\n\nOn Sunday night, the storm registered 75 mph, upgrading it from a tropical storm to a hurricane at that point, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nDangerous storm surge conditions are expected along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts through the middle of the week, the NWS warns. Flash flooding is also expected along those coastlines.\n\nThe flooding, along with strong winds, will bring down trees and powerlines, causing the potential for extended outages.\n\n\"Get out,\" Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency Director Chris Stallings said during a news conference Sunday evening.\n\n\"Get you and your family out ahead of time ... Just because the system isn't a hurricane doesn't mean that it's not going to be impactful. Some of our most impactful floods have been tropical storms and tropical depressions here in Georgia,\" he added.\n\nMotorists should avoid driving into water that appears shallow. The water can be much deeper than expected, and currents could be swift enough to sweep vehicles from the road.\n\n\"This is a life-threatening situation,\" the Hurricane Center warned. \"Persons located within these areas should take all necessary actions to protect life and property from rising water and the potential for other dangerous conditions.\"\n\nAs a result of the storm, Vice President Kamala Harris postponed her rally Friday in Savannah. She was set to headline with her yet-to-be-named running mate, part of a four-day swing through several battleground states.\n\nIt is the second time in less than a year that Valdosta and surrounding areas were expecting hurricane or tropical storm conditions. Hurricane Idalia brought damaging winds and flooding to the area last year.\n\nAs the core of Debby chugged toward Valdosta, there were moderate gusts of wind and rain. Locals like Jared O'Neal, whose power is out and whose home suffered $50,000 in damage last year during Idalia, were buying generators. The Lowe's store on St. Augustine Road sold around 30 of them Monday morning.\n\n\"There is still a possibility to see some flooding rains with a total of 10 to 15 inches, which is what was forecasted,\" Meghan Barwick, spokesperson for the Lowndes County Emergency Management Agency, said Monday afternoon. \"We're still heavy winds and some gusts. We've got power lines down, trees down. Nothing like Hurricane Idalia, but we still want our folks to be vigilant and stay off the roads and at home if they can. We haven't gotten reports of extensive damage with trees through houses like we did with Idalia.\"\n\nThe Lowndes EMA estimated that about 25,000 people were without power early Monday afternoon.\n\nIn St. Simons, pounding rain and strong winds kept tourists and fisherman away from the main pier and nearby shops and restaurants Monday. Beaches were also deserted as residents and visitors still on the island prepared to hunker down.\n\nThe F.J. Torras Causeway, which connects Brunswick to St. Simons Island, remains open. According to a joint emergency declaration from Glynn County and Brunswick City commissioners, the causeway will remain open unless there are water hazards and flooding. The Sidney Lanier Bridge will remain open unless wind speeds reach 40 mph sustained. Any decision to close the bridge will be made by the Georgia Department of Transportation.\n\nAirlines have canceled hundreds of flights, including on routes to and from cities in Florida.\n\nAtlanta-based Delta Air Lines has issued a travel waiver for Fort Myers, Gainesville, Jacksonville, Key West, Sarasota, Tallahassee and Tampa, as well as Valdosta. It is allowing people who had flights booked to, from or through those cities over the weekend through Monday to reschedule their flights to avoid the impact of the storm without paying a higher fare, subject to certain conditions.\n\nJoe Marinelli, president and CEO of Visit Savannah, the local convention and visitors bureau, said one saving grace of the storm impact is that it will hit the area during the early part of the week - a slower period for tourism, with no citywide conventions in town. Marinelli said he didn't want to discourage people from visiting later in the week or next weekend.\n\n\"It will have some impact on those that were maybe planning to come into Savannah a couple days early (before the weekend) ... but you know, this too shall pass,\" he said.\n\nMarinelli said he suspects some restaurants, tour operators and museums may close Tuesday and Wednesday, but he was not aware of any hotels in Savannah relocating guests.\n\nMarinelli said on Monday morning: \"It's raining right now, but nothing more than a normal rain. ... The concern is that it's going to rain nonstop for three days.\"\n\n- Staff writers Kelly Yamanouchi and Ligaya Figueras contributed to this article.", "source": {"uri": "newsobserver.com",

Stop, and turn around.\"", "source": {"uri": "wjcl.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC 22 - WJCL Savannah"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aj_sisson@wjcl.com", "name": "Aj Sisson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_dumping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal dumping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drainage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extreme weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormwater", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormwater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_waste", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green waste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special-purpose_local-option_sales_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special-purpose local-option sales tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_drain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Storm drain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Litter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rain"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Trenchless_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Trenchless Technology", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Tobacco/Pipes", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Tobacco/Pipes", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Pipes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Pipes", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/thumbnail-66ad5ef9dc32d.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792521", "eventUri": "eng-9792521", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

National Hurricane Center (NHC).\n\n\"This is a level four out of four risk for excessive rainfall,\" Michael Brennan, director of the NHC, told reporters.\n\n\"Please, be very cautious when you're

storm response.\n\nDebby was expected to bring \"potentially historic rainfall\" of up to 30 inches as it moved north, the NHC said.\n\nBut it said the storm was weakening after making landfall earlier with sustained speeds of 80 mph (130 kph) as a Category One hurricane -- the lowest on a scale of five.\n\nIn July, at least 18 people were killed when the powerful Hurricane Beryl tore

The system will likely stall out over the Lowcountry, which could prolong these issues.\n\nThis rainfall could result in areas of flash and urban flooding, with isolated river flooding possible.\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning and Storm Surge Warning are now in effect along the Georgia and South Carolina coast to the South Santee River.\n\nDebby is expected to bring a life-threatening storm surge to portions of Florida and major flooding in the southeastern United States. A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for the Florida coast from Indian Pass to Aripeka; and St. Augustine, Florida to South Santee River South Carolina.\n\nAt 8 p.m. Monday, the center of Tropical Storm Debby was located near latitude 30.7 North, longitude 82.4 West, about 50 miles east of Valdosta, Georgia or 50 miles west-northwest of Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nDebby is moving toward the north-northeast near 6 mph. A gradual decrease in forward speed with a turn toward the east is expected later Monday and Tuesday.\n\nOn the forecast track, the center will move across southeastern Georgia Monday night and Tuesday, and move offshore of the South Carolina coast by late Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph with higher gusts. Some slight additional weakening is forecast for Monday night and Tuesday. Some re-strengthening is possible Wednesday and Thursday when Tropical Storm Debby moves off the southeastern coast.\n\nAdditional weakening is forecast through late Tuesday. Some re-strengthening is possible on Wednesday. Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles from the center.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb or 29.41 inches.\n\nA Storm Surge Warning is in effect for the Florida coast from Aripeka to the Aucilla River; and the Georgia and South Carolina coasts from the Mouth of the St. Mary's River to South Santee River South Carolina.\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for the Florida coast from Indian Pass to Aripeka; and St. Augustine, Florida to South Santee River South Carolina.\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours. A Storm Surge Warning means there is a danger of life-threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline.", "source": {"uri": "live5news.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Meteorologists called it a \"1,000-year-rain event.\"\n\nThis week, just nine years after that atmospheric freak occurrence, the city is bracing for rains that are even more torrential, thanks to Hurricane Debby, which hit Florida as a Category 1 on Monday and is expected to reach South Carolina as a tropical storm this week.\n\nThere are a few differences between the two events. The 2015 storms were not tied to a tropical event. The expected inundation this week, which could see upwards of 30 inches of rain hitting parts of the city, are tied to Tropical Storm Debby. Both, though, underscore the impact of rising ocean temperatures.\n\nOn the Saffir-Simpson scale, Debby is not an especially scary storm. Most Charlestonians would have simply ridden it out and barely given it a second thought had it been following a normal path. Tropical storms are, after all, an inconvenient part of living along the Southeast coast. But meteorologists say Debby will stall around the time it hits the Georgia/South Carolina border, resulting in the massive rainfalls.", "source": {"uri": "fastcompany.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fast Company"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_morris@fastcompany.com", "name": "Chris Morris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charleston, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charleston, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Debby_(2000)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Debby (2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sea surface temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2024/08/p-91167837-hurricane-debby-and-what-is-to-come.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792521", "eventUri": "eng-9792521", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

DeSantis: 4 Florida deaths attributed to Debby, 250,000 without power", "body": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - Gov. Ron DeSantis said four deaths on Monday have been attributed to now Tropical Storm Debby, including a double-fatal car crash in Dixie County, a death in a big-rig crash in Hillsborough County and a boy who was killed when a tree fell onto the roof of the family's home in Levy County.\n\nHurricane Debby made landfall about 7 a.m. Monday near Steinhatchee as a Category 1 storm, bringing the rural Big Bend region its second hurricane in less than a year.\n\nDebby, which made landfall with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph, slowed down, was downgraded to a tropical storm and turned northeast, before it started meandering across North Florida and Southeast Georgia, with the National Hurricane Center saying it could produce \"catastrophic flooding in some locations.\"\n\n\"We have seen and will continue to see flooding in every part of the state of Florida,\" Gov. Ron DeSantis said during a morning news conference at the state Emergency Operations Center.\n\nDeSantis said as of Monday afternoon, 250,000 customers were without power across the state and over 450,000 accounts have been restored since the storm began.\n\nThe Florida Division of Emergency Management has completed 435 storm-related missions, and they are currently in the process of completing another 400 more, DeSantis said.\n\nDeSantis said the state is ready to make flooding rescues after the storm passes.\n\nHe said Tampa and St. Petersburg ports are closed but are due to open Monday evening and all airports are open.\n\nThe storm is expected to move off the southeast U.S. coast late Tuesday and could come back inland over South Carolina on Thursday.\n\nSteinhatchee is in Taylor County, roughly 90 miles south of Tallahassee. On Aug. 30, 2023, Hurricane Idalia made landfall in Taylor County's Keaton Beach with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph and storm surge of 7 to 12 feet along the coast. Idalia then caused widespread damage as it moved across North Florida.\n\nDebby, potentially a historic rainmaker, started pounding the Gulf Coast on Sunday.\n\nState Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said the goal is to restore electricity to 80 to 85 percent of customers within 24 to 48 hours.\n\n\"We're going to tackle it,\" he said. \"It's going to be all hands on deck going in there to get that power restored.\"\n\nGuthrie said more than 35 tornado warnings had been issued in the state, and additional \"tornadic activity\" will occur as the system moves across North Florida.\n\n\"The hazards from this storm will be seen and felt far outside the center of the cone,\" Guthrie said, referring to the cone showing the storm's potential path. \"Flood impacts are going to be felt everywhere.\"\n\nNorth Florida and Central Florida could get 10 to 12 inches of rain, which will cause rivers to flood during the next week, Guthrie said.\n\nPart of recovery efforts will include moving resources closer to the Sarasota Bradenton area, which DeSantis said received \"a significant amount of water.\"\n\nDeSantis said he didn't anticipate the state will \"dent\" the more than 11 million bottles of water and 3 million meal rations available.\n\nOn Sunday, the White House said President Joe Biden had approved a federal emergency declaration to provide assistance. The declaration authorizes the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster relief efforts and cover 75 percent of certain storm costs for counties.", "source": {"uri": "news4jax.com",

The recent deluge was highlighted by 1.72 inches falling at the airport on July 26 and nearly 1 inch on Aug. 2.\n\nThat's left the ground in some areas water logged and rivers and retention ponds with high water levels.\n\nTRACK THE STORM: See Tropical Storm Debby's latest path\n\nWilmington is used to seeing a lot of rain from tropical storms. But as with many things, it is where and how quickly it falls that could determine how big of a problem any flooding could be.\n\nWith some projections showing Debby could dump 16 inches or more in some places, here's how that compares to rainfall amounts of recent storms, according to the weather service:\n\nLow-lying roadways and areas around waterways are known problem areas, but it isn't just rain runoff and drainage that can cause issues.\n\nDebby's storm surge could help push tides much farther inland than normal. That could have the effect of stopping the rainwater that's flowing toward the ocean from making it all the way to the Atlantic, adding another flooding mechanism to the equation.\n\nAccording to the weather service, large uncertainty remains about how much storm surge Debby will bring to the N.C. coast due to the storm's still undetermined path as it moves north. As of Monday afternoon, forecasts were calling for about 2 feet of storm surge.\n\nWhile that doesn't sound like a lot, Hurricane Isaias, which hugged the Brunswick County coast four years ago, was a relatively small, weak storm. But the storm surge was strong enough to push the tidal portion of the Cape Fear River into downtown Wilmington, causing significant street flooding and damaging some businesses along Water Street. It also set a record for the highest level ever recorded at the Wilmington tidal gauge.\n\nThe danger from flooding is often called the silent killer by emergency officials because it hits at night, when people are sleeping, and days after a storm event, when people are starting to let their guard down.\n\nHurricane Floyd, for example, made landfall near Bald Head Island as a Category 2 storm early on Sept. 16, 1999. But by late afternoon the same day, the sun began peeking through the clouds as the driving wind and rain bands either dissipated or moved inland. Many people had lost power, but damages along the coast seemed relatively light.\n\nBut the torrential rains had overwhelmed the capacity of the Cape Fear, Tar, Neuse, Roanoke and Pamlico river watersheds, and soon some rivers and creeks were rising at up to 8 inches an hour. What followed were weeks of rising and moving floodwaters and months, even years, of recovery. The Northeast Cape Fear River, for example, crested at 22.8 feet four days after the hurricane made landfall. Minor flooding at the N.C. 53 bridge east of Burgaw starts at 10 feet.\n\nHere are some known flooding hot spots in the Wilmington area:\n\nReporter Gareth McGrath can be reached at GMcGrath@Gannett.com or @GarethMcGrathSN on X/Twitter.

The hurricane is expected to bring heavy winds and rains throughout the Southeast including in Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.\n\nAccording to the state emergency department, an Enhanced Watch is the second level of a three-tier activation system. It involves preparing state agencies to \"take action\" during a natural disaster. The department said it is already beginning to coordinate response operations for Hurricane Debby.\n\nJonathan Blaes, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Raleigh, said the hurricane will likely bring severe rainfall to the coastal and eastern regions of the state.\n\nAreas near Wilmington, Myrtle Beach and Charleston are forecasted to have 12 to 16 inches of rain. Fayetteville and Goldsboro could see about six to 12 inches. The Raleigh area will likely see five to 10 inches of rain.\n\n\"Those are significant rainfall amounts,\" Blaes said. \"Those are easily two or three months' worth of rain just over the course of a week.\"\n\nThe risk of heavy rainfall decreases toward the Northwest part of the state, with the Asheville and Boone area forecasting about a couple inches of rain.\n\nBlaes said the worst weather would likely occur Wednesday through Friday as the storm drifts into the Carolinas. The heavy rainfall will likely be joined by strong winds, with 30-50 mph wind gusts along the beaches and 20-30 mph in Fayetteville and the Triangle area.\n\nHowever, Blaes said it is too early to determine where the strongest gusts will occur, because they'll be located in the center of the storm. The biggest threat will be prolonged heavy rainfall, which can lead to dangerous flooding.\n\n\"We have a long history, an unfortunate history, of folks drowning during and especially after hurricanes because they drive through flooded roadways,\" Blaes said. \"It's one of the largest killers in the state - people dying from fresh water flooding, not storm surge.\"\n\nBlaes said this flooding risk can last for several days, even after heavy rainfall has ceased. He recommends people prepare for the storm now by making sure they have a good supply of food and ensuring any necessary medications are filled. Other ways to prepare for the storm include having cash in case the power prevents credit card use, and keeping cell phones charged.", "source": {"uri": "wfae.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFAE

REUTERS/Octavio Jones\n\nStorm Debby made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida on Monday morning and began a slow crawl toward the Atlantic Coast, on track to unleash a week of torrential rain and catastrophic flooding across the US Southeast.\n\nThe hurricane slammed ashore around 7 am near Steinhatchee, Florida, about 70 miles (115 km) southeast of Tallahassee, delivering winds of up to 80 mph (130 kph), the National Hurricane Center said. It had weakened to a tropical storm by mid-morning.\n\nDebby had already dumped up to a foot of rain in some parts of the state's southwest, Florida Division of Emergency Management Executive Director Kevin Guthrie said.\n\nHours after the storm's landfall in Steinhatchee, heavy rains were still falling on the beach town, and bayfront restaurants were flooded.\n\nAt least one person was dead in Hillsborough County, as rescue crews in Tampa recovered the body of an 18-wheeler truck driver who had lost control of the vehicle on Interstate 75 and went into the Tampa Bypass Canal, local TV station WTSP reported.\n\nThe hurricane center predicted Debby would move offshore into the Atlantic by Tuesday night, but then re-strengthen and come back inland to unleash torrential rains on the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina later in the week.\n\nThe center forecast \"catastrophic flooding,\" with local areas from Florida to southeastern North Carolina receiving more than two feet of rain by Friday morning.\n\n\"This is going to be an event that is going to be probably here for the next five to seven days, maybe as long as 10 days, depending on how much rainfall we get,\" Guthrie said.\n\nRoughly 280,000 customers were without power in Florida, according to Poweroutage.us.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis said the state had been approved for federal disaster assistance on Sunday and that 17,000 workers were on hand to restore power.\n\nHundreds of flights were canceled at Florida airports on Monday. Tallahassee International Airport said on X that it closed at midnight and would reopen at noon on Monday if it were safe to do so.\n\nSLOW DRENCHING\n\nA slow-moving tropical storm as it passed over Cuba, Debby gained strength from exceptionally warm Gulf waters as it paralleled Florida's Gulf Coast.\n\nDebby bears some of the hallmarks of Hurricane Harvey, which hit Corpus Christi, Texas, in August 2017. Downgraded to a tropical storm as it moved inland, Harvey lingered over Texas, dumping about 50 inches of rain on Houston and causing $125 billion in damage.\n\nClimate scientists believe man-made global warming from burning fossil fuels has raised the temperature of the oceans, making storms bigger and more devastating.\n\nThe last hurricane to make a direct hit on the Big Bend region was Hurricane Idalia, which briefly gained Category 4 strength before making landfall as a Category 3 in August 2023, with winds of more than 125 mph. The National Centers for Environmental Information estimated $3.5 billion in damages. DeSantis described the initial effects of Debby as \"modest\" compared with Idalia.\n\nForecasters expect numerous Atlantic hurricanes in the 2024 season, which began on June 1, including four to seven major ones. That would exceed the record-breaking 2005 season that spawned the devastating Katrina and Rita hurricanes.\n\nOnly one hurricane, Beryl, has yet formed in the Atlantic this year. The earliest Category 5 storm on record, it struck the Caribbean and Mexico's Yucatan peninsula before rolling up the Gulf Coast of Texas as a Category 1 storm, with sustained winds up to 95 mph.",

Here's How Much.", "body": "Tropical Storm Debby, which came ashore as a category 1 hurricane along the Florida coast early Monday, will move across the Southeast on Tuesday at roughly the speed of a human walking. That slow pace will allow it to deliver historic amounts of rainfall -- most likely measured in feet instead of inches -- that could lead to catastrophic flooding over the next several days.\n\nAlex Lamers, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center, said this slow pace is a hallmark of the most significant and damaging tropical cyclone rainmakers.\n\nDebby's meandering forecast path across the Southeast for the next several days is likely to be eerily similar to that of Hurricane Harvey, which flooded the Houston Metro area in August 2017, and Hurricane Florence, which drenched North Carolina for days in 2018. Like Debby, both storms stalled over the region and became reminders that a hurricane's hazards can persist and intensify for days after it makes landfall.\n\nThe old cities of Savannah, Ga., and Charleston, S.C. -- which have both seen their fair share of tropical storms and where flooding has become more frequent recently -- will likely see the brunt of this storm. \"Charleston is particularly vulnerable to flooding because it's shaped sort of like a bowl with very poor drainage,\" said Erica Grow Cei, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center.\n\nForecasters believe Debby will rival or break rainfall records in Georgia (set by Alberto in 1994 with 27.85 inches) and South Carolina (set by Florence in 2018 with 23.63 inches) for the most rain that has ever fallen in each state. The forecast calls for widespread rainfall of 10 to 20 inches and, in some areas, upward of 25 inches.\n\nThe areas most likely to be hit hardest by the rain will be determined by the precise track of the storm's center, which was still uncertain early Tuesday. Even small changes in the steering currents could result in Debby shifting and changing where the rain falls.\n\nBecause of this, an expansive and rare warning of a high risk for excessive rain has been issued in the region for today and tomorrow by the Weather Prediction Center forecasters who specialize in heavy rainfall events. Over the years, when this group has issued this type of high-risk forecast, the storms within the area the forecasters outlined have typically created damaging and often deadly flooding, said Zack Taylor, a meteorologist with the prediction center.\n\nDebby is expected to move gingerly near the South Carolina coast on Tuesday and Wednesday. The storm will most likely move slightly offshore, allowing some restrengthening before the storm turns north and moves back inland.\n\nWhile the worst of the rainfall will be in the South over the next couple of days, hundreds of miles north, flash flooding will also be possible because of the storm's circulation, from Baltimore northeast up the I-95 corridor to the Boston metro area, in what is called a predecessor rainfall event. These typically occur north of the central circulation and are separate from the main area of precipitation.\n\nDebby will funnel huge amounts of moisture northward and collide with cooler air moving into the region, allowing storms to form. Storms will likely repeat over the same area, like train cars on a track, bringing at least two to four inches of rain in an urbanized area, likely leading to some cases of flash flooding.", "source":

As such, both cities have been placed under a mandatory curfew.\n\nThe most recent hurricane projections suggest South Carolina will be hit as soon as Thursday at 2pm ET\n\nDue to Debby's slow movement on land, some areas could be drenched with 10 to 30 inches of rainfall, which will likely worsen cause even more damage to roads, bridges and other key pieces of infrastructure\n\nThe storm is expected to slowly move east through Georgia, then swing into the Atlantic ocean by Tuesday. By Wednesday, Debby will turn north and could strengthen before making landfall in South Carolina by Thursday evening.\n\nNorth Carolina will be hit as well, with the storm expected to make an appearance there some time Friday.\n\nAs the storm mostly moves past Florida, over 133,000 customers in the state remain without power as of 1am ET, according to poweroutage.us.\n\nThat number is more than 28,000 in Georgia, a figure that's likely to climb as winds and rain become more intense throughout the morning on Tuesday.\n\nAll of this comes as authorities have released the most up to date death toll from the devastating storm - five people have died so far, four in Florida and one in Georgia.\n\nA 19-year-old was killed in Moultrie, Georgia, after a tree fell on the side of a home Monday afternoon, marking the latest death.\n\nMoultrie is located in south Georgia, around 200 miles south of Atlanta.\n\nA similar tragedy unfolded in Levy County, Florida, where a 13-year-old boy was crushed by a tree that fell onto his mobile home, marking the first life claimed by the storm.\n\nThe second person to die was driving a tractor-trailer near Tampa early Monday. The 64-year-old Mississippi man behind the wheel lost control on the slick road and plunged off an interstate bridge into a canal, according to Florida Highway Patrol.\n\nPictured: A tree fell onto the home of a 13-year-old boy. The trunk fatally crushed him. He was the first to lose his life to the hurricane\n\nHillsborough County Fire Rescue is pictured pulling a tractor-trailer from the water after it veered off the road in the early morning hours on Monday\n\nTragically, the driver of the truck did not survive the fall\n\n'The vehicle rotated, collided with a concrete barrier wall along the outside shoulder and traveled over the wall,' the highway patrol wrote in a press release following the incident.\n\n'The trailer came to rest hanging from the bridge while the cab separated and fell into the Tampa Bypass Canal.'\n\nHeartbreaking photos show members of Florida's Hillsborough County Fire Rescue team pulling the truck out of the water.\n\nA 38-year-old woman and 12-year-old boy were also killed in a car crash in Dixie County, Florida, on Sunday evening.\n\nA 14-year-old boy that was also in the car is in critical condition, CNN reported.\n\nWitnesses to the single-vehicle crash told police the car lost control and 'struck the guardrail in the center median, then re-directed, overturning, leaving the roadway to the right,' according to the statement from the Highway Patrol.\n\nNone of three people were wearing seatbelts, police added.\n\nPolice and first responders are seen boating through what were once drivable streets to rescue people from submerged homes\n\nA member of the Sarasota Sherriff's Department is seen wading into water that's above his waist\n\nIn Gulfport, a Tampa-adjacent city, a man's body was found by police after witnesses said he anchored his sailboat near Gulfport's Veteran's Park, FOX 13 reported.\n\nThe man hasn't yet been positively identified, but the man on the boat is believed to be 48-year-old Brian Clough.\n\nClough reportedly lives on his boat with his dog, who was rescued by nearby boaters.\n\nSlightly further south in Sarasota, Florida, police and first responders piloted through flooded streets and successfully evacuated roughly 500 people from homes that were underwater.\n\nThe city, which is roughly 60 miles from Tampa, got more than a foot of rain from the storm, more than a month's worth.\n\nThe extreme flooding from Debby has also wreaked havoc on critical infrastructure throughout the state.\n\nOne example came in south Hillsborough County, near Tampa, where a 15 foot section of road completely caved in thanks to a dormant sinkhole being torn open by the gushing water.\n\nOfficials closed the road to traffic on Monday.\n\nBrian Clough, another presumed victim of the deadly tropical storm, is pictured alongside his dog\n\nA 15 foot section

streets of eastern Hillsborough County\n\nDue to Debby's slow movement on land, some areas could be drenched with 10 to 30 inches of rainfall, which will likely worsen cause even more damage to roads, bridges and other key pieces of infrastructure.\n\nAs the situation worsens throughout the south, governors are getting serious about response strategies.\n\nGeorgia Governor Brian Kemp has deployed 2,000 state national guard troops to assist with evacuations and rescues.\n\nRoy Cooper, the governor of North Carolina, a state that hasn't been hit yet, has preemptively declared a state of emergency.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has also approved emergency declaration request from Florida, Georgia and North Carolina, a move that will mobilize relief efforts.", "source": {"uri":

And while it's winds were significantly weaker than when the storm made landfall along Florida's Big Bend yesterday (August 5, 2024), the real threat from this system has always been the flooding.\n\nGiven its contorted projected path and slow forward motion - Debby is currently headed northeast at a mere six miles per hour - the storm is expected to dump several feet of rainfall on the South Carolina Lowcountry. That means conditions in the Palmetto State's low-lying counties - which were already deteriorating as of late Monday - are going to get worse before they get better over the coming 48 hours.\n\nConcerns are especially pronounced in Charleston, the Palmetto State's most populous city and one with a history of flooding. Meanwhile, several tornados touched down late Monday - including one on Edisto Beach, S.C.\n\nThere are also reports - already - of potential dam failures, including a private dam on the Black Creek in Colleton County.\n\nAccording to the latest advisory from the the National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami, Florida, Debby was located at latitude , longitude - or approximately miles southwest of Charleston.\n\n\"A slow motion toward the east and then north is expected through Thursday night,\" forecasters noted. \"On the forecast track, the center of Debby is expected to move offshore the coast of Georgia later today, drift offshore through early Thursday, and then move inland over South Carolina on Thursday.\"\n\nGiving this slow drift - and turn back inland - the storm is projected to rival 2015's 'Floodmageddon' in terms of participation.\n\n\"Debby is expected to produce potentially historic rainfall totals of 10 to 20 inches, with maximum amounts of 25 inches, bringing areas of catastrophic flooding across portions of southeast Georgia, the eastern half of South Carolina, and southeast North Carolina through Friday.\"\n\nLuckily, the direst rainfall projection forecasts from earlier this week have been somewhat scaled back - and the area projected to receive the worst of Debby's deluge has shifted slightly to the northeast.\n\nUnfortunately, that means the Yadkin-Pee Dee basin - which experienced significant flooding during Hurricane Florence in 2018 - could be in line for even worse flooding this go-round.\n\nCourtesy of NHC, here are the latest rainfall projections associated with Debby...\n\nOur media outlet has been tracking Debby from the beginning as it evolved from a wave to a depression to a tropical storm... and ultimately the second hurricane of 2024.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies were on high alert as Debby's downpours began dousing the Palmetto Lowcountry.\n\nIn Charleston, S.C., city officials have imposed curfews on residents and are blocking ingress to its historic peninsula at certain points. Meanwhile, in Beaufort County sheriff's deputies are being inundated with reports from residents related to the storm.\n\n\"Since yesterday afternoon, we've received dozens of storm-related calls with downed trees, downed power lines, and flooded roads,\" a statement from the Beaufort County sheriff's office noted. \"Please DO NOT drive through flooded roads. Remember that saying, 'turn around, don't drown.' You never know exactly how deep the flood waters are and they pose danger to you and your safety. We continue to encourage you to stay off the roads unless you must travel.\"\n\nUtility crews were also deploying in anticipation of Debby's visit to the Palmetto State.\n\n\"Our crews are ready to respond, and we are closely monitoring the storm's path,\" a statement from Dominion Energy noted.\n\n\"Heavy rains and flooding can saturate the soil, loosening root systems and toppling trees which can take down poles and overhead lines,\" the utility warned. \"If you see a downed power line, STAY AWAY, and report it immediately.\"\n\nWant to share your experiences with this storm?

Ron DeSantis will travel Tuesday to areas hit by Hurricane Debby, as flood risks increase from the storm dumping rain in North Florida and Georgia.\n\nDebby made landfall at about 7 a.m. Monday as a Category 1 storm in Steinhatchee in Taylor County. As forecast, it produced large amounts of rain and storm surge without packing catastrophic winds. The system slowed once overland and inched across the Georgia border at 7 mph in a north-northeast direction.\n\n\"The hazards from this system are far-reaching and will be long-lasting,\" Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said Monday afternoon during a briefing at the state Emergency Operations Center. \"Depending on the type of basin and the type of river that we're dealing with ... this is going to be about a week-long event that we're going to be monitoring.\"\n\nDebby had maximum sustained winds of 80 mph at landfall and was downgraded to a tropical storm by 11 a.m. as it moved slowly across North Florida. While additional weakening was expected, tropical storm warnings were issued for numerous areas, including Alachua, Baker, Bradford, Columbia, Duval, Nassau, Putnam, St. Johns and Union counties.\n\nAt least four deaths were attributed to the storm, with two in Dixie County and one in Hillsborough County involving vehicle crashes, officials said. In Levy County, a teen died after a tree crashed through the roof of a mobile home.\n\nAbout 250,000 utility customers had power outages Monday afternoon, and electricity had been restored to 322,000 customers.\n\nGuthrie said the Division of Emergency Management had started coordinating with counties about their needs and on Tuesday will begin damage assessments with homeowners.\n\nThe White House over the weekend announced a federal disaster declaration for the storm, providing assistance mostly to cover county evacuation and sheltering costs. The state was working to expand the declaration to include assistance for debris removal, Guthrie said.\n\nDeSantis said he will be on the road Tuesday to see areas that sustained damage. He noted contrasts with the more powerful Hurricane Idalia in 2023 and Hurricane Ian in 2022.\n\n\"The good thing is that there's not really a place where you would do a big tour of the damage compared to what we saw with Idalia and certainly what we saw with Hurricane Ian,\" DeSantis said.\n\nDebby followed a similar path as Idalia, which made landfall nearly a year ago in Taylor County as a Category 3 hurricane. Ian hit Southwest Florida in September 2022 as the fifth-strongest hurricane on record to make landfall in the contiguous U.S.\n\n\"There's still risks. There's a risk from a lot of water. But from a wind perspective, this (Debby) was not at the level of the previous storms that we've seen in this state,\" DeSantis said. \"So, all in all, especially given that these folks had already been hit 11 months ago, we're glad that we're getting reports that were not seeing a lot of widespread wind damage.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"},

(WIS) - As of 5PM Monday afternoon, the eye of Debby is crossing the Florida-Georgia border as a strong Tropical Storm, with South Carolina in its sights.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center continues with Tropical Storm/Storm Surge Warnings and Watches that stretch into coastal portions of Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nAfter crossing through Southern Georgia, Debby looks to stall out along the coast of South Carolina, where flooding could make for a dangerous situation. The main threats from Debby will be rounds of heavy rain, widespread flooding, and wind gusts that range from 30 to 50 MPH.\n\nFor the Low Country and Pee Dee, the highest totals of rain will occur, where isolated amounts of rain as high as 20 inches can be expected.

Rivers from Florida to North Carolina are rising rapidly or are forecast to do so. The St. Marys River in northern Florida has risen more than 10 feet (3 meters) in the last day, according to the National Weather Service. The Ohoopee River in Georgia is forecast to rise more than 15 feet nearing a record in coming days.\n\nNearly 162,000 customers are without power in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nThe US Southeast has been battered by a number of storms in recent years that have led to widespread flooding and damage to agriculture in the region. Most notable was 2018's Hurricane Florence that killed more than 50 people and left a trail or widespread destruction because of its heavy inland rains.\n\nDebby is slowing making its way through the South this week before finally being swept up the East Coast this weekend.

It has since moved inland over northern Florida and southeastern Georgia.\n\nRegardless of strength, Debby has been and will continue to be a major rainmaker, bringing enormous totals across coastal Georgia, northeastern South Carolina and southeastern North Carolina.\n\nThe storm continues to move slowly northeast, prolonging the rain threat in the region.\n\nThis strong wording from the National Hurricane Center says it all: \"This potentially historic rainfall will likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding in parts of Georgia and South Carolina\".\n\nHere's an updated breakdown of what to expect locally.\n\nTIMING\n\nThe worst of the weather is Tuesday through Thursday but it could linger into Friday.\n\nExpect bands of very heavy rain Tuesday through Thursday.\n\nFrom today through Friday, most of the area will receive 8-12\" of rain. Along the SC/NC border, 16 to 20\" of rain is forecast. Locally higher amounts are possible. If these rain totals occur, it WILL cause significant to major flooding.\n\nGusts will range from 20-30 mph most of the week but could gust between 35-45 mph later Thursday and Friday. Debby will emerge over the ocean on Wednesday and could regain some strength. Understand that if Debby can re-organize it's core as it moves back over the Atlantic, stronger gusts can occur.\n\nWith all the rain and loose soil, some trees could fall, and power outages would be possible.\n\nA tornado risk will be in place from Tuesday through Thursday, especially along the coast as feeder bands from Debby move in.\n\nA long period of onshore winds will produce rough surf, dangerous rip currents and coastal flooding.\n\nStorm surge is expected to be up to two to four feet for the Grand Strand. Unfortunately, the specific track is uncertain for Wednesday and Thursday, so stay tuned for changes and be prepared just in case the storm surge is a tad higher.\n\nThese warnings have been issued for the Grand Strand.

It is expected to move off the coast of Georgia later today where it will stall as steering currents weaken. This will allow the storm to strengthen over the warmer waters of the Atlantic, leading to flooding and historic rain across the Carolina and Georgia coast. It will begin to move back inland Thursday morning and away from the Carolinas by Friday evening.\n\nIMPACTS\n\nTropical Storm Warnings in effect along the Georgia and South Carolina coasts. A Tropical Storm Watch has been extended north to Surf City, NC.\n\nWind: Current sustained winds are 45 mph, with some strengthening likely Wednesday and Thursday. Tropical storm force conditions expected for areas under the warning through Thursday night. Tropical storm conditions expected to begin Wednesday morning for the NC coast under the watch.\n\nStorm Surge: 2-4 ft storm surge possible from Altamaha Sound, GA to Cape Fear, NC\n\nRainfall: 10-20'' with up to 25'' with catastrophic flooding in parts of Georgia and the Carolinas.\n\nTornadoes: A few possible for coastal South Carolina tonight through Wednesday.\n\nSurf: Dangerous surf and life threatening rip current risk along the southeast coast through the end of the week\n\nLOCAL IMPACTS\n\nThe outer rain bands of Debby are already reaching the southern edge of the region this morning. Expect showers through the day with scattered showers Wednesday as Debby sits off the coast. Rainfall totals locally will depend on the extent of the westward track of Debby as it moves inland Thursday. As of now, the highest rainfall totals will set up east of I-77/I-85 with the heaviest rain and highest flooding threat Thursday morning through Friday morning. Up to 25-30 mph gusts possible beginning Wednesday.\n\nMountains: Up to 2''\n\nFoothills: 2-3''\n\nPiedmont near I-77/I-85: 3-5''\n\nChesterfield/Lancaster/Richmond Co: 5''+\n\nPREVIOUS UPDATE 10pm 8/5\n\nDebby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane along Florida's Big Bend early Monday morning - near Steinhatchee, Florida. Sadly, at least 4 people have died as a result from this system so far.\n\nAs of the 10 PM advisory on Monday, Tropical Storm Debby has maximum sustained wind of 45 mph and is crawling northeast at 7 mph.\n\nDebby is expected to bring nearly 2 feet of rain to parts of Georgia and South Carolina. This will bring widespread flash flooding that will be catastrophic and life threatening.\n\nLocal Impacts From Debby:\n\nThere will be a sharp rain total gradient across the area. As of Monday afternoon, rain totals span from 1\" in the mountains to nearly 10\" in Chesterfield county. IF the storm stalls a bit more westward, the rain totals will shift west as well. This means higher totals for more of our area. IF the storm stalls a bit more eastward, it is possible our rain chances will be lower.\n\nTiming: We will see bands roll into our area on Tuesday, but not for everyone. The main timeline is late Wednesday through Saturday. Thursday and Friday will be our highest impact days.\n\nThreats: Flooding is the main threat. Gusty winds are also possible. The tornado threat will be low, but not zero. Downed trees and power outages are possible.\n\nRain Totals:\n\nNow - Wednesday: 0-0.50\" north of I-85. 1-3\" in Chesterfield county. Anson and Richmond could also see upwards of 2\".\n\nWednesday - Saturday:\n\n- Mountains: 0.5\"-2\"\n\n- Foothills: 1-3\"\n\n- Charlotte: 2-5\"\n\n- Southeast of Charlotte: 5-10\"\n\nWind: We could see wind gusts up to 35 mph on Thursday, but most of the time our wind gusts will stay around 20-25 mph.\n\nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedin", "source": {"uri": "wccbcharlotte.com", "dataType":

Thanks to a video shared by one family in Florida, now you can.\n\nA man in Gulfport in south Florida found an unusual visitor in his driveway on Sunday as Hurricane Debby - which has since been downgraded to a tropical storm - approached the state, bringing heavy rain, 80 mph winds and extensive flooding.\n\nLouis Bardach told wire service Storyful that he was riding out the bad weather when he found none other than a catfish washed up in his driveway. Noting in the video that the fish was \"very much alive,\" Bardach explained to the camera that the \"very weird catfish\" had likely been dragged to the driveway by the storm.\n\nBardach's footage shows the dark, whiskered fish sitting relatively still on the blacktop until Bardash moves to touch it, at which point it begins flopping back and forth in a slithering-like motion.\n\n\"It's walking away,\" Bardach continues. \"Not sure how it got here, or where he's trying to get to.\"\n\nThe \"walking\" Bardach refers to is the fish's effective movement across land using its fins, which allowed it to reach a deeper puddle on the flooded streetway and swim off.\n\nThe walking catfish (Clarias batrachus) is a freshwater species of catfish native to Southeast Asia but often found in Florida. The species can move across dry land using its pectoral fins, which allow it to remain upright and wiggle across surfaces like a snake. They are also equipped with a special gill structure that allows them to breathe air.\n\nThis ability to breathe and move on land allows the fish to jump from water source to water source in search of food and survival. It is not uncommon to find walking catfish in swampy areas of Florida like the Everglades, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission. They are also prone to appearing in drainage systems after major storms and flooding.\n\nThe species first appeared in Florida in the 1960s, possibly the result of escapes from human-kept aquatic facilities. They can now be found across most of South Florida, according to the Florida Museum.\n\nThe fish grow to about 20 inches long, weigh 2.5 pounds and usually appear in shades of gray-brown with white spots. It is illegal to possess and transport live walking catfish in the state.\n\nTropical Storm Debby\n\nTropical Storm Debby, the fourth named storm of the 2024 hurricane season, originally formed in the Gulf of Mexico on Sunday before touching down in Florida as a Category 1 hurricane around 7 a.m. Monday.\n\nThe storm made landfall with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph near the town of Steinhatchee, killing at least four people. Debby moved across northern Florida for more than three hours before being downgraded to a tropical storm, with wind speeds slowing to 65 mph by 2 p.m.\n\nState officials have reported widespread flooding and electrical outages, leaving at least 250,000 homes and businesses without power across northern Florida as of Monday afternoobn. The storm is expected to make its way across the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina, dropping a \"potentially historic heavy rainfall\" of 19 to 20 inches from northern Florida to southeastern North Carolina, and upwards of 30 inches in parts of northern Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nPresident Joe Biden declared a state of emergency across Florida on Sunday, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the Florida National Guard and Florida State Guard were activated to support humanitarian assistance.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp also declared a state of emergency for his state as the storm approached.", "source": {"uri": "courier-journal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Courier-Journal"}, "authors": [],

(FOX 5 DC) - This summer of 2024 has been a lot of things, but one way not to describe it would certainly be \"wet.\"\n\nThe first half of summer (June 1 - Jul 15) was D.C.'s driest start to a summer since 1988 and tied for the third-driest on record.\n\nWhile late July and early August have brought more thunderstorms and more rain, much of the region remains in a severe to extreme drought. Our region needs rain, and with Tropical Storm Debby forecast to track northward in the days ahead, we just might have our best shot of the summer so far at putting a major dent in the current drought situation in our region.\n\nAfter making landfall as a hurricane in northern Florida on Monday morning, Debby has weakened to a tropical storm, and as of Monday night had crossed into Georgia.\n\nDebby is forecast to eventually drift off the coast into the warm Atlantic waters off the Georgia and South Carolina coastlines, where she should maintain tropical storm intensity.\n\nHer forward speed will slow to a crawl at this point, as upper atmospheric winds weaken. This means several days of heavy, likely flooding rains for parts of Georgia and the Carolinas, with the National Hurricane Center suggesting some areas around Charleston, South Carolina could see upwards of 20\" of rainfall in the coming days.\n\nWhile Debby will remain far from the D.C. region during the middle of the week, the moisture she is propelling atmospherically will drift northward ahead of the storm.\n\nHere, it will interact with a frontal boundary that will be sinking southward on Tuesday afternoon and evening, before stalling during the middle of the week.\n\nAlong and ahead of this boundary, the threat of heavy showers and thunderstorms will be elevated, though scattered in nature. While not expected to be a major issue midweek, localized flooding and severe weather are possible Tuesday through Thursday as this boundary remains present.\n\nBy the end of the week, southern winds will increase and lift Debby northward, with Thursday night - Saturday morning being the most likely time of Debby's slow passage through the region.\n\nThis would give the potential for something we have not had at all yet this summer...a washout. At this time, Friday looks like the most likely day of wall-to-wall rainfall in the DC region. Though it could start as early as Thursday night and end as late as midday Saturday, depending on Debby's exact forward speed.\n\nAs the center of Debby is forecast to pass to the southeast of the immediate D.C. area, severe weather is not a big concern with this storm. In fact, the storm is expected to weaken enough by the time it gets here that tropical storm-force winds are not expected to be an issue.\n\nIt will likely be breezy, and gusts over 30mph will be possible, but as far as stronger gusts, those are most likely closer to the beaches like Ocean City, Maryland and Rehoboth, Deleware where winds coming off the open ocean will benefit from a lack of topographic friction to slow them down. But Debby is expected to be little more than a tropical depression when she passes by.\n\nThe biggest impact locally will be rainfall.\n\nAs mentioned previously, Debby's heaviest rains will be across coastal portions of the Carolinas simply because of her slow movement in this region and the fact the center will be sitting over a warm, open ocean, essentially creating an atmospheric highway of sorts for moisture to stream inland.\n\nFlash flooding risks in these areas will be high, as many could see over a foot of rain in just a few days. These low-lying coastal areas are very prone to flooding during high precipitation events as well.\n\nCloser to the D.C. area, the National Hurricane Center suggests that anywhere between 2\" and 6\" of rainfall is possible.\n\nModel simulations for our region paint a soggy picture as well, with most suggesting anywhere between 3\" and 5\" of rain will be possible between Thursday night and Saturday afternoon.\n\nDespite the dry drought conditions across the region, we will run the risk for some isolated flooding issues as the storm passes by our region due to the amount of forecast rain.\n\nIf you live in a flood-prone region, make sure you are paying attention to flooding alerts. The free FOX 5 Weather App is great for tracking these alerts.\n\nWhile Debby will be one of the strongest systems that we have had to deal with this summer, it is hard to ignore the benefits that will come along with it.\n\nWe have already mentioned how much we need the rain to cut into the drought in our region. But as the storm pushes northward through the weekend, behind it will come a much drier, refreshing air mass out of Canada. Along with that, some cooler, but still comfortable, temperatures.\n\nFor a summer that has been the hottest in D.C. history, the cooler weather will bring heat relief to many - at least for a little while....", "source": {"uri": "fox5dc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 5 DC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_thomas@fox5dc.com", "name": "Mike Thomas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

Meteorologists are saying that the Grand Strand will be getting historic levels of rain, which could lead to flooding.\n\nHorry County has the potential for extreme flooding, according to forecasts from earlier this week. Officials are warning people against driving in flooded areas and not bypassing barricades on the road, as it can be deadly.\n\nOn Monday,\n\nThis is the first named tropical system to work its way through Myrtle Beach during the 2024 hurricane season.\n\nOn Monday night, President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for the state of South Carolina ahead of an impending storm that's expected to yield historic rainfall in the area.\n\nThis action by the President authorizes FEMA to coordinate disaster relief throughout the state.\n\nEmergency protective measures, which includes federal assistance and reimbursement for evacuation and shelter support is active will now be provided at 75 percent funding from the federal government to 34 South Carolina counties, including: Aiken, Allendale, Bamberg, Barnwell, Beaufort, Berkeley, Calhoun, Charleston, Chesterfield, Clarendon, Colleton, Darlington, Dillon, Dorchester, Edgefield, Fairfield, Florence, Georgetown, Hampton, Horry, Jasper, Kershaw, Lancaster, Lee, Lexington, McCormick, Marion, Marlboro, Newberry, Orangeburg, Richland, Saluda, Sumter and Williamsburg counties.\n\n- Elizabeth Brewer, ebrewer@thesunnews.comEarly morning forecast for Tropical Storm Debby\n\nUPDATED 6:01 A.M.\n\nEarly on Tuesday morning, the National Hurricane Center their latest forecast for Debby.\n\nScientists are still predicting historic heavy rainfall in parts of southeast Georgia and eastern South Carolina through Friday, which will result in catastrophic flooding.\n\nDangerous storm surge and tropical storm conditions will spread north along the southeastern coast from northeastern Florida to North Carolina through the middle of this week.\n\n\"Storm surge and tropical storm watches and warnings have been issued for portions of these areas,\" the forecast said. Residents in the storm surge watch and warning area should follow any advice given by local officials.\n\nPlaces that Debby has already passed through in Florida still have deadly hazards, including downed power lines and flooded areas.\n\n- Elizabeth Brewer, ebrewer@thesunnews.com\n\nMyrtle Beach area fishing piers have a long history of sustaining damage during major storms, but owners are hopeful recent renovations will keep the structures upright through Tropical Storm Debby. The storm could bring 12-16 inches of rainfall to Horry County, with the bulk of the rain coming Wednesday, according to the latest National Weather Service projections.\n\nThe potential for damaging storm surge, which is typically the cause of any pier destruction, is minor, the NWS reports. The area's piers most recently took a hit two years ago, when Hurricane Ian impacted at least four piers along the coast of Horry and Georgetown counties.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, storm surge from Ian split Cherry Grove Pier, North Myrtle Beach's only public pier, in half.\n\nCherry Grove Pier just finished repairs and fully reopened in July, and manager Edgar Stephens told The Sun News Monday that it's been great to see the structure return to full use.\n\nThe pier was rebuilt higher than before to lessen the chance of storm surge causing major damage in the future, and Stephens said the bulk of their prep work ahead of Debby will just involve tying down items on the pier.\n\nLike humans, many critters and pests will seek out shelter from heavy rainfall, storm winds and flood water.\n\nTodd Metz, owner of Critter Control in Myrtle Beach, has worked in pest control for a decade and says residents can expect an influx of these, \"casual invaders,\" inside homes.\n\nWith storm weather on the way, the bugs and animals to watch out for in South Carolina during and after Tropical Storm Debby are roaches, snakes, spiders, rodents, opossums, fire ants and mosquitoes.\n\nLots of swimming snakes call South Carolina home and may try to find shelter in homes and on porches. Even after flooding has gone down, displaced snakes may be stuck inside.\n\n\"They may end up coming into houses, through openings that normally they couldn't get into because of the high water,\" Metz said. \"They could get left behind when the water recedes. That's what we see a lot of when the water goes down. These animals may be trapped in an outbuilding or in a structure, a house or vehicle and places like that.\"\n\nThe short answer to that is not this time around. But, he is in South Carolina.\n\nJim Cantore has a reputation. It has nothing to do with his personality, but his presence in an area has a kind of repulsive effect -- the \"Jim Cantore effect.\"\n\nAs of Monday, Aug. 5, Cantore is in Charleston, South Carolina, contributing to The Weather Channel's coverage of Tropical Storm Debby, Greenville News reported. He was spotted at Charleston International Airport on Sunday, according to a Charleston radio station.\n\nHe's a longtime meteorologist for The Weather Channel. Throughout his career, Cantore has covered major storms including hurricanes Katrina, Sandy, Matthew, Irma and Dorian.\n\n\"It's his work in the midst of those storms that has made him the meteorologist his viewers hate to see coming -- if Cantore is in town, it means it's time for everyone else to leave,\" The Weather Group writes.\n\nThe storm is expected to move slowly, resulting in \"catastrophic\" amounts of rainfall. The Grand Strand area could see between 10 to 20 inches of rain, according to the South Carolina Emergency Management Division.\n\nThat could mean some in Horry County will postpone plans or cancel events in preparation for the severe weather this week. If you have a cancellation or closing, email online@thesunnews.com.\n\nCheck out here for a live feed of event cancellations and postponements.\n\nMany Myrtle Beach area resorts and restaurants livestream their views.\n\nFor most of the year, these webcams show tranquil beach scenes for visitors longing for the ocean. When a storm hits, the cameras can turn into tools for locals and tourists alike to witness the effects in real-time.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors":

There is an increasing risk of at least a couple of inches of rain that could cause some flooding from Maryland to Massachusetts Friday through Sunday.\"\n\n\"This tropical threat could re-strengthen this weekend,\" AccuWeather Chief On-Air Meteorologist Bernie Rayno stated in the release. \"Southern New England should be prepared for potential impacts from a tropical storm late this week and this weekend.\"\n\nAccuWeather added that \"Debby is expected to create rough surf and rip currents along the entire East Coast throughout the week and into next weekend.\"\n\nAccording to a report from the National Hurricane Center, as of early Tuesday morning, \"Debby's center was some 50 miles southwest of Savannah, Georgia and 130 miles southwest of Charleston, South Carolina.\"\n\nThis forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm. It does not illustrate the full width of the storm or its impacts, and the center of the storm is likely to travel outside the cone up to 33% of the time.\n\nIllustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest-performing models to help make its forecasts.\n\nYou've probably heard hurricanes referred to by categories, a metric for ranking how strong they are.

By 11 a.m. ET (1500 GMT), it weakened into a tropical storm and was traveling north, carrying with it the potential for record-setting rain and dangerous flooding, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported. At least four deaths have been reported so far in Florida, and over 300,000 people remain without power across the state, NBC reported.\n\nThe hurricane's outer bands can be seen in the satellite footage sweeping across the state, where it delivered at least two isolated tornadoes and intense thunderstorms, including a few that overturned several campers in an RV park. The satellite continued to capture imagery the storm as it barreled toward the state in the early hours of Monday and as it came ashore in the morning.\n\nSuch satellite imagery helps scientists determine the strength, size, shape and direction of the storms. The day-time views of the hurricane seen in the video are approximately the way they would appear to human eyes from space, according to NOAA. The city lights shining in the night-time views are not real-time depictions, but are sourced from a static database of nighttime mosaics gathered by another NOAA satellite.\n\nHurricane Hunters of the U.S. Air Force Reserve, who flew into Debby on Sunday, provided data useful for NHC weather forecasting.\n\nDebby is the fourth named storm of this year's Atlantic hurricane season, after Hurricane Beryl and tropical storms Alberto and Chris, all of which formed in June. Forecasters have warned that the season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, will be a busy one.\n\nDebby, now a tropical storm ferrying \"potentially historic\" amounts of rain and winds of 70 miles per hour (110 kilometers per hour), is moving north along the southeastern coast, the NHC said. In the coming days the storm is expected to dump up to four feet of rain in both Georgia and South Carolina. Governors in both states have declared emergencies.", "source": {"uri": "space.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Space.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sharmila_kuthunur@space.com", "name": "Sharmila Kuthunur", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic hurricane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinhatchee,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steinhatchee, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Steinhatchee, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainband", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rainband"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bend_(Florida)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Bend (Florida)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_hunters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane hunters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_Reserve_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air Force Reserve Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_imagery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satellite imagery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weather forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/59jsW3irSfngpGxFUwMrVD-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792521", "eventUri": "eng-9792521", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-06-01", "dateEnd": "-11-30", "textStart": 2332, "textEnd": 2349}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 718, "textEnd": 724}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

Debby has since been downgraded to a tropical storm.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said damage assessment teams will be in the field Tuesday now that the once-Hurricane Debby, downgraded to a tropical storm by late Monday afternoon, has largely left the state.\n\nDebby made landfall around 7 a.m. on the Big Bend with 80 mph winds earlier in the day near Steinhatchee, a village with fewer than 1,000 residents. Little significant damage was initially reported, but Debby - a slow moving storm - was deluging a wide swath of the state from the Nature Coast to the Suwannee River Valley with record rain.\n\nDeSantis, at the state's Emergency Operations Center on Monday afternoon, said flooding will remain a threat for the next seven days: The storm \"did not bring the catastrophic hurricane force winds that we've seen in previous storms like Hurricane Ian and Michael, but it has and continues to produce lots of water.\"\n\nBy 5 p.m., Debby's eye wall was crossing the state line into Georgia.\n\n\"We are going to see flooding, particularly in the northern part of the state, (so) be very careful. Don't go out into flood waters. There can be hazards, debris and downed electrical cables. Please do not go driving if roads are underwater,\" DeSantis said.\n\nDeath toll by Monday stood at four\n\nDeSantis also said at least four people had died from fallen trees and car crashes:\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, more than 250,000 customers were without electrical power in Florida. DeSantis said service had been restored to more than 150,000 homes and businesses. Some 17,000 line workers were working to restore electricity.\n\nAs of 3 p.m. Monday, all airports in the state were open. All seaports were expected to resume operation by nightfall, and the Florida Department of Transportation had completed inspections of 8,400 miles of roadway and 69 bridges.\n\nWhile the Skyway Bridge in Tampa is experiencing some closures, the most significant damage appeared to be downed signage. DeSantis said he will tour the storm-affected areas on Tuesday.\n\nAlso, the Florida Department of Commerce received field requests to set up stand alone \"pods\" Tuesday in Jefferson, Taylor and Dixie counties to distribute supplies, food and other resources.

The captain of the port has issued an all-clear for Tampa's commercial waterways, and navigation should resume shortly.\n\n\"We want to express our sincere appreciation to those who helped our port prepare and recover from the impact of the storm,\" the port said in a statement.\n\nThe port's landside facilities remained open throughout the storm. Tampa is essential to Florida because it handles nearly half of the state's petroleum supply, and its operations are doubly important during a natural disaster, when first responders and citizens need reliable access to energy.\n\nCommercial vessels are already queuing to return to Tampa Bay, including product tankers and two cruise ships, the Margaritaville at Sea vessel Islander and Carnival Cruise Line's Carnival Paradise. Waterside operations are expected to resume Tuesday.\n\nDebby strengthened into a hurricane on Sunday and made landfall on Monday morning near the town of Steinhatchee, Florida. The storm brought winds of about 70 knots and a storm surge of 6-10 feet, plus heavy rains. Flooding was reported throughout the Big Bend region, a sparsely-populated area of woods and marsh on the east end of the Florida Panhandle. It left downed powerlines and flooded roads in its wake, but no fatalities have been reported to date.\n\nDebby quickly lost strength over land and was downgraded to a tropical storm once more by the afternoon. Its track should pass over the border into Georgia, then out over open waters of the Atlantic by Tuesday. The storm is expected to turn north again soon after it heads offshore, then make a second landfall over South Carolina with storm-level winds of up to 50 knots.\n\nIn anticipation of storm-force winds, the Georgia Ports Authority plans to shut most operations for the day on Tuesday and reopen Wednesday, after Debby has passed.\n\nThe biggest risk to life and property is from heavy rainfall and flash flooding in inland areas, warned the National Hurricane Center. \"Given the sluggish forward motion of Debby, extremely large amounts of rainfall over the Southeastern U.S. [are] anticipated,\" NHC said in a forecast advisory Monday. The \"potentially historic\" rains will last throughout the week, and some isolated areas could see totals of up to 30 inches over several days.", "source": {"uri": "maritime-executive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Maritime Executive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Tampa_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port Tampa Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_captain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sea captain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Navigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_Paradise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carnival Paradise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_Cruise_Line", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carnival Cruise Line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bend_(Florida)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Bend (Florida)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_tanker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oil tanker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panhandle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panhandle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Storm surge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cruise ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knot (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinhatchee,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steinhatchee, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Steinhatchee, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Ports_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Ports Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flash flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Photos/Ocean/NOAA-GOES20-Hurricane-Debby.8c437f.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792521", "eventUri": "eng-9792521", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

The probability of tropical storm force winds continues to increase, especially along coastal areas from Cape Fear southward.\n\nBrunswick, New Hanover and Pender counties are expected to see rainfall amounts of 12 to 16 inches, which could result in life-threatening flash flooding, according to the weather service.\n\nThe significant flooding could result in some roads being washed away and flooded. \"Similar past events have led to flash flood related fatalities from people attempting to drive across flooded roads,\" the weather service said. \"Do not drive across flooded areas - the current may sweep your vehicle off the road, or the weight of your vehicle may collapse the road.\"\n\nThe weather service also advised people living along rivers and creeks to make preparations for possible moderate to major flooding developing later this week. The risk of major flooding is highest for the following rivers: Lumber River, Little Pee Dee River, Black Creek, Northeast Cape Fear River and Waccamaw River.\n\nINTERACTIVE MAP: Enter your address to see hurricanes, tropical storms that have passed nearby\n\nStorm surge of 2 to 4 feet is possible from Cape Fear southward, which includes Brunswick County. The threat of surge will increase, especially around high tide Wednesday through Friday morning. This could impact roads prone to coastal flooding and areas where the shoreline is weak from previous storms.\n\nOn Monday, the weather service also said there is a marginal risk of tornadoes, primarily across portions of northeastSouth Carolina, beginning tonight. Forecasters are assessing how this threat could change through Tuesday and beyond.\n\nRough surf, including dangerous rip currents, and hazardous marine conditions are expected through much of the week.\n\nHurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Even if this system won't pose a threat to the NC coast, it's never too early to be prepared.\n\nGET READY: Are you prepared for a hurricane?

As it moves northeast, the storm is forecast to stall over the U.S. Southeast and deliver torrential rainfall.\n\nThis GeoColor image was captured by the ABI (Advanced Baseline Imager) on the GOES-16 (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-16) at 3 a.m. Eastern Time, four hours before Debby made landfall. The satellite is operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which includes the National Weather Service (NWS). NASA helps develop and launch the GOES series of satellites, which observe Earth from about 22,000 miles (36,000 kilometers) above the equator.\n\nDebby developed into a tropical storm on August 3 in the Gulf of Mexico, becoming the fourth named storm of the 2024 hurricane season. Bands of intense rainfall soon began to lash western Florida, dumping over a foot (30 centimeters) of rain near Sarasota between August 3 and 4.\n\nBy August 5, Debby had grown into a Category 1 storm with sustained winds of around 80 miles (130 kilometers) per hour at the time of landfall. As of 11 a.m. Eastern Time that day, over 207,000 homes were without power, according to PowerOutage.us. NWS forecasts called for the storm to bring 10 to 20 inches of rain and \"life-threatening\" storm surge of up to 10 feet to parts of the Big Bend region, where Florida's panhandle curves to meet the peninsula.\n\n\"There's a lot of warm water and low vertical wind shear in the Gulf of Mexico right now, which are two key ingredients for storm intensification,\" said Patrick Duran, a hurricane expert at NASA's Short-Term Prediction Research and Transition (SPoRT) project, based at Marshall Space Flight Center. Vertical wind shear is the difference in the speed and direction of lower-level and upper-level winds. High shear rips the tops off of developing hurricanes and weakens them, while low shear allows storms to build.\n\nNASA's SPoRT team focuses on improving weather forecasts using satellite data from NASA and NOAA. Duran uses the ABI instrument on GOES satellites in his work to look at fine-scale structures in clouds and find the center of a storm's circulation. ABI's infrared bands are used during the day and night to look at the depth of a storm's convection and how it is developing.\n\nDebby hit the same stretch of sparsely populated land as Idalia, which came ashore as a Category 3 hurricane in August 2023. Though Debby is weaker than Idalia, its slower pace means it could unleash \"potentially historic\" rain across the Southeast, according to the NWS. Forecasts indicate that from August 5 to 10, parts of southeast Georgia, coastal South Carolina, and southeast North Carolina could see 10 to 20 inches of rain, with up to 30 inches possible in some places.", "source": {"uri": "earthobservatory.nasa.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "NASA Earth Observatory"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type":

Below are some all-time records for the state, according to NOAA meteorologist David Roth, NOAA/NCEI and weather historian Christopher Burt.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\n- 24-hour rainfall record: 14.80 inches at Myrtle Beach in Sept. 1999, during Hurricane Floyd.\n\n- All-time record rainfall from a tropical cyclone: 23.63 inches at Loris in Sept. 2018 during Hurricane Florence.\n\n- Lingered over/near the Carolinas for almost three days after landfall.\n\n- Peak rainfall total: 35.93 inches near Elizabethtown, N.C. and 23.763 inches at Loris, S.C, both state records for any tropical system.\n\n- An estimated 10 trillion gallons of rain fell on the Carolinas.\n\n- Total estimated damage: $29.8 billion (2024 dollars); Damage in N.C. alone was more than they experienced in Hurricanes Matthew (2016) and Floyd (1999), combined, according to NOAA.\n\nMatthew (Oct. 2016)\n\n- Hugged the coast from Georgia to the Carolinas for about 36 hours as a hurricane before it moved offshore.\n\n- Peak rainfall total: 18.95 inches near Evergreen, North Carolina. Areas from coastal Georgia to southeast Virginia picked up over 12 inches of rain with rainfall rates as high as 7 inches per hour.\n\n- 100,000 homes, businesses, structures flooded in eastern North Carolina after historic river flooding that lasted for weeks.\n\n- Total estimated U.S. damage: $13 billion (2024 dollars), according to OAA.\n\nUpper Low Taps \"Joaquin\" (Oct. 2015)\n\n- Weird, swirling upper-level low over the Southeast U.S. tapped moisture from distant Hurricane Joaquin and pumped it into South Carolina for several days\n\n- Peak rainfall total: 27.15 inches at Mt.

As it moves northeast, the storm is forecast to stall over the U.S. Southeast and deliver torrential rainfall.\n\nThis GeoColor image was captured by the ABI (Advanced Baseline Imager) on the GOES-16 (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-16) at 3 a.m. Eastern Time, four hours before Debby made landfall. The satellite is operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which includes the National Weather Service (NWS). NASA helps develop and launch the GOES series of satellites, which observe Earth from about 22,000 miles (36,000 kilometers) above the equator.\n\nDebby developed into a tropical storm on August 3 in the Gulf of Mexico, becoming the fourth named storm of the 2024 hurricane season. Bands of intense rainfall soon began to lash western Florida, dumping over a foot (30 centimeters) of rain near Sarasota between August 3 and 4.\n\nBy August 5, Debby had grown into a Category 1 storm with sustained winds of around 80 miles (130 kilometers) per hour at the time of landfall. As of 11 a.m. Eastern Time that day, over 207,000 homes were without power, according to PowerOutage.us. NWS forecasts called for the storm to bring 10 to 20 inches of rain and \"life-threatening\" storm surge of up to 10 feet to parts of the Big Bend region, where Florida's panhandle curves to meet the peninsula.\n\n\"There's a lot of warm water and low vertical wind shear in the Gulf of Mexico right now, which are two key ingredients for storm intensification,\" said Patrick Duran, a hurricane expert at NASA's Short-Term Prediction Research and Transition (SPoRT) project, based at Marshall Space Flight Center. Vertical wind shear is the difference in the speed and direction of lower-level and upper-level winds. High shear rips the tops off of developing hurricanes and weakens them, while low shear allows storms to build.\n\nNASA's SPoRT team focuses on improving weather forecasts using satellite data from NASA and NOAA. Duran uses the ABI instrument on GOES satellites in his work to look at fine-scale structures in clouds and find the center of a storm's circulation. ABI's infrared bands are used during the day and night to look at the depth of a storm's convection and how it is developing.\n\nDebby hit the same stretch of sparsely populated land as Idalia, which came ashore as a Category 3 hurricane in August 2023. Though Debby is weaker than Idalia, its slower pace means it could unleash \"potentially historic\" rain across the Southeast, according to the NWS. Forecasts indicate that from August 5 to 10, parts of southeast Georgia, coastal South Carolina, and southeast North Carolina could see 10 to 20 inches of rain, with up to 30 inches possible in some places.\n\nNASA Earth Observatory image by Lauren Dauphin, using GOES 16 imagery courtesy of NOAA and the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS).

After crashing into Florida, the storm has been downgraded to a tropical storm.\n\nDebby is expected to creep across the state and into southern Georgia over the next day.\n\nAs it swept up the west coast and reached land, the winds and rain knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of Floridians.

However, as of Monday morning, nearly 150,000 people are still without power.\n\nSee Also: Debby brings more than strong storms: 25 cocaine bricks wash ashore FL Keys\n\nCrews with the Florida Department of Transportation have surveyed approximately 4,500 miles of state roads to gauge their condition and see if they are still passable. Several public transit lines also shut down operations on Monday because of flooding, while others focused their efforts on evacuating people to local emergency shelters.\n\nTallahassee International Airport and Gainesville Regional Airport were both closed because of the weather and were set to reopen when safe, the governor's office stated.

The result will be a \"major flooding event\" due to the long duration of impacts, leading to \"extremely high rainfall totals\" that could cause significant supply chain disruptions, he said.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) had similar warnings, saying \"Potentially historic heavy rainfall, associated with Hurricane Debby, across southeast Georgia and South Carolina through Friday morning will likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding.\"\n\nSpecific commercial disruption could strike industries including aerospace & defense, life sciences, manufacturing, oil & gas, and high-tech, according to an analysis by Resilinc. Those potential impacts could involve nearly 17,000 sites at risk, which perform activities like manufacturing, warehousing, distribution, fabrication, and testing.\n\nIn response, the emergency response nonprofit American Logistics Aid Network (ALAN) is urging residents of the Southeast to heed emergency management officials' warnings about everything from safely evacuating to sheltering in place- and asking members of the logistics community to be ready to help. \"In addition to high winds and a significant storm surge, Hurricane Debby has the potential to bring huge amounts of rain and significant flooding to many parts of Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. That has us especially concerned, because flood waters are often the deadliest and most underestimated effect of a hurricane,\" Kathy Fulton, ALAN's executive director, said in a release.\n\nThe event also highlights the increasing need to improve supply chain resiliency, according to Moody's. In an analysis, the firm noted that following Hurricane Beryl, which was the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record in the North Atlantic Basin, Hurricane Debby is the second U.S. hurricane landfall of 2024, which is forecast to be an active hurricane season. \"With the increasing frequency and severity of hurricanes, the resilience of supply chains faces unprecedented challenges,\" John Donigian, Supplier Risk Management Strategy, Moody's, said in a statement. \"Proactive supply chain planning, backed by advanced risk data and analytics, is essential. For instance, by analyzing real-time data on hurricane paths and intensities, businesses can pre-emptively reroute shipments, secure alternative suppliers, and adjust inventory levels to mitigate potential disruptions.\"", "source": {"uri": "dcvelocity.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DC Velocity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The storm will batter the coastal areas of these states with wind, waves, and a storm surge. But, it's the flooding that may prove devastating.\n\nThere is no more prolific rainfall-generating system in nature than a tropical cyclone -- i.e. a hurricane or tropical storm. The rate of rainfall is SO extreme, it overwhelms the ability of soils to absorb or rivers to move water out of affected areas fast enough to prevent flooding. Here the latest National Hurricane Center (NHC) public advisory on Debby: https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/.../MIATCPAT4+shtml/051749.shtml?\n\nTHE METEOROLOGICAL SET-UP BACKSTOPPING THE DEVELOPING EXTREME RAINFALL SITUATION\n\nEstimated Rainfall totals over the coming days\n\nHere's one model (the RRFS high resolution, convection-allowing ensemble model which is to become operational in the months to come and is being run in parallel for testing with other NWS models) estimate of rainfall over just the coming 60 hours. Heavy rainfall is to persist beyond that period as the storm's forward motion slows. \"Ensemble\" model forecasts average across a whole series of forecast solutions rather than relying on a single forecast and therefore attempt to reconcile variations between individual forecasts. Research has shown the ensemble approach to forecasting leads to more accurate predictions.\n\nWith jet stream winds, which might otherwise whisk tropical storm Debby across the Southeast, displaced far to the north, placing the storm in a region of light upper steering winds, a scenario develops in which Debby slows to a crawl in the coming days. This is to take place with the storm over the warm, energy-rich waters of the western Atlantic which are also the source of a prolific source of moisture.\n\nCheck out the Monday morning Environment Canada 500 mb analysis I'm posting which shows steering winds surrounding Debby at the 18,000 ft level of 5 to 10 mph. As a result, forecast models all but stall the system over the region producing local 20'' rainfalls-if not more.\n\nPrecipitable water-that's the atmospheric moisture available in a column of air extending past 30,000 ft into the atmosphere to any precipitation-generating system-is off the charts HIGH-Monday morning approaching 3''. The towering cumulonimbus clouds which populate and, indeed, serve as the core of tropical storms, sweep this moisture into concentrated downpours that produce rainfalls many times the precipitable water values.\n\nOur most humid weather system here in Chicago produced precipitable water values topping 2'' -- what's available to Debby surpasses that. Yet 16.91'' of rain fell on the Greater Chicago area -- a statewide record -- in the historic flooding of July, 1996. That was a single 24 hour period! Imagine what days of rainfall from a stall system may end up producing in the eastern Carolinas!\n\nTHE BENCHMARK FLOOD SITUATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA\n\nHere's a summary from South Carolina's most severe flood episode from the South Carolina State Climatology office:\n\n\"1908 - Flood: The flood of August 26-30, 1908, was the most extensive flood of record; all major rivers in the state rose from 9 to 22 feet above flood stage. A low pressure center formed in the Gulf of Mexico and moved northeastward across South Carolina causing unprecedented statewide flooding. There was heavy damage to crops and property along the rivers.\"\n\nState residents were also confronted by monumental flooding in 1928 and when Hurricane Hugo swept ashore in Sept 1989.\n\nA MORE

What that means for power outages.", "body": "Heavy rains expected this week from what's now Tropical Storm Debby likely will saturate the ground in much of North Carolina, leaving some trees and even power poles vulnerable to being uprooted by gusty winds.\n\nToppled trees and poles can mean downed power lines that cause spotty to widespread outages.\n\nWhat is soil saturation?\n\nNormally, soil has voids where it can take in water, easily absorbing average amounts of rainfall. Saturated soil occurs during periods of heavy or extended rainfall when rainwater fills all the voids, leaving no more spaces.\n\nSaturated soil doesn't hold together as well as unsaturated soil, becoming muddy and pliable.\n\nTree roots, which create friction with unsaturated soil as a tree rocks in the wind, are more likely to slip and slide through saturated soil, reducing the tree's stability and increasing the chance it will uproot and fall in high winds.\n\nHow much rain does it take to saturate the ground?\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says it takes 2 to 2.5 inches of rain to saturate the soil to a depth of about 8 inches.\n\nIn his blog on Monday, Assistant State Climatologist Corey Davis said that after the second-driest June on record for the state overall, North Carolina saw the 11th-wettest July since record-keeping began in 1895. Preliminary totals show a statewide average rainfall of 8.29 inches for the month, Davis said, more than 3 inches above the average from 1991 to 2020.\n\nWhile every county in the state was in some level of drought on July 9, by July 30, when the most recent drought map was published, half the state showed no drought at all and the other half showed abnormally dry with just a few counties in moderate drought.\n\nIn areas where the ground is parched -- or saturated -- meteorologists say, heavy rains tend to run off, causing flash flooding.\n\nHow much rain is coming?\n\nDebby is a slow-moving storm carrying a lot of moisture, and meteorologists say it could drop record-setting amounts of rainfall in southeast Georgia and coastal South Carolina.\n\nAs it comes into North Carolina, Debby is expected to bring:\n\n\u25aa 12 to 16 inches of rain in the extreme southeastern corner of the state;\n\n\u25aa 8 to 12 inches of rain in the area reaching horizontally from Anson County to Pamlico County;\n\n\u25aa 6 to 8 inches in a crescent from Union County to Hatteras Island, including Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill;\n\n\u25aa 4 to 6 inches in a crescent from Charlotte to the northern Outer Banks;\n\nThe National Hurricane Center forecasts as of Monday showed wind speeds associated with Debby of just 5 mph to 20 mph as the storm moves through the southeast before dissipating or moving out to sea.\n\nBasil Camu, a master arborist with Leaf & Limb of Raleigh, said Monday he doesn't expect widespread loss of trees as a result of Debby because the wind speeds will be relatively low. He said some trees are likely to fall along creeks and rivers, however, because of flooding from heaving rains eroding the soil around the roots.\n\nTrees that are diseased or have been damaged, such as having some of their roots bulldozed for a house addition, he said, also could be vulnerable.\n\nOtherwise, he said, in much of North Carolina, \"Our trees and flowers and grasses are still feeling a little dry, so the rain will actually be a good thing for our plants.\"\n\nIs Duke Energy worried?\n\nDuke Energy, the largest electric utility in North Carolina, is bracing for the impacts of Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nLogan Stewart, communications manager for Duke Energy in Charlotte, said Monday the company's meteorologists were saying it's too early to know what effects the storm will have.\n\nWhere heavy rain and flooding do bring down trees onto power lines, she said, it complicates the process of restoring power.\n\nCustomers sometimes get impatient, she said, because it can take takes two crews to restore power after a tree falls: one to cut and remove the tree safely and a second to repair damaged lines.\n\nWith a storm like Debby, Stewart said, \"We may see a lot of scattered outages, individual pockets with one, two, three, four or five customers out. But there will be a lot of them. And we physically send line workers to every single outage. We can't just flip a switch.\"\n\nDuke has sent 350 crew members from the Midwest to help with power outages in Florida, Stewart said, and some of those line workers can come to North Carolina to help out if needed.\n\nMeanwhile, she said, customers should make plans to relocate if the power goes out if they have household members who need electricity to survive.", "source": {"uri":

The storm has already been blamed for at least five deaths.\n\nAccording to AccuWeather, the heaviest swath of rainfall totals of 18-24 inches is expected to occur across far southeast Georgia and southern South Carolina, including around the cities of Savannah and Charleston.\n\nThe rain will slowly make its way up the East Coast during the week and will likely reach New England by the weekend, where the NWS in Boston issued this warning Tuesday: \"Rises on rivers as well as flash flooding are possible, but an uncertain storm track casts uncertainty on where the heaviest rain falls.\"\n\nHow much rain will fall? By the time Debby dissipates this upcoming weekend, the storm will have dropped upwards of 50 trillion gallons of rain on the eastern United States from Florida to Maine, according to meteorologist Ryan Maue.\n\nMaue says that makes Debby the wettest landfalling hurricane ever, even topping such powerhouse rainmakers as Hurricane Harvey in 2017. That storm dumped more than 27 trillion gallons of rain over Texas, according to the Texas Division of Emergency Management.\n\nWhy is there so much rain?\n\nDebby is a \"slow-moving storm,\" said Brian Haines, the meteorologist-in-charge at the National Weather Service in Charleston, South Carolina. This allows the storm to dump huge amounts of rainfall.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said, \"The cyclone is situated in an area of weak steering currents.\" That means the storm has stalled, University of Miami meteorologist Brian McNoldy said on his blog, which \"will be responsible for a very significant flooding threat this week.\"\n\nWhile some tropical cyclones increase in forward speed as they move north, Debby is crawling along at only 6 mph, as of Tuesday afternoon, the NHC said.\n\nDrought buster in the Mid-Atlantic?\n\nFor some in the Mid-Atlantic, Debby's rain will be \"good news,\" according to the Capital Weather Gang blog, as \"drought is extreme over a large portion of Washington's western suburbs as well as into adjacent parts of West Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania.\"\n\n\"It's often the case that tropical rainstorms end summer droughts and Debby offers that possibility,\" according to the Capital Weather Gang.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com",

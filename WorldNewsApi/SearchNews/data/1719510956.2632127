{"id": 223735582, "title": "Where does the Celtics\u2019 Game 3 win rank among Jayson Tatum\u2019s best playoff performances?", "text": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Jayson Tatum has played in 107 playoff games in his seven-year NBA career. It is not a challenge to identify his best performance. It has to be his 46-point effort in Game 6 of the 2022 Eastern Conference semifinals against the defending champion Milwaukee Bucks. The Celtics trailed, 3-2, in the series. They were on the road. It looked bleak. The Bucks were coming off a Game 5 win in which this one-man defensive scheme named Jrue Holiday \u2014 perhaps you have heard of him? \u2014 made two sensational late plays, including a midcourt steal against Marcus Smart that suddenly looks awfully familiar. Tatum\u2019s best playoff game? No doubt. Game 6, Milwaukee, 2022 must be the choice. Oh, yeah: And we just witnessed the runner-up. Maybe it\u2019s dangerous to rate such things in the immediate afterglow of a thrilling victory. But this one is going to stick. Tatum scored 36 points, grabbed 10 rebounds, dished out 8 assists \u2014 including one certain to make his career highlight reel \u2014 as the Celtics rallied from an 18-point deficit to stagger the Indiana Pacers in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals Saturday night, 114-111. The Celtics now lead the series 3-0, with Game 4 Monday. It was an extraordinarily complete effort by Tatum, who became the first player in NBA history to reach the aforementioned point, rebound, and assist totals without committing a single turnover. What did he do? Just everything. He scored 15 points in the first quarter to set the tone. He provided stout post defense in the second half after Myles Turner and Pascal Siakam ate the Celtics alive inside during the first half, outscoring them in the paint 42-18 in the first 24 minutes. (This was truly the first time the Celtics have missed Kristaps Porzingis during this playoff run.) Every one of Tatum\u2019s 10 rebounds seemed to come in heavy traffic. He knocked down an enormous 3-pointer with 1 minute 41 seconds to play, cutting the Pacers lead to 109-106 after the Celtics had come up short on multiple previous attempts to draw closer. Four of his assists came in the fourth quarter, when, rather than forcing his own offense, he did what the truly elite are supposed to do: he elevated his teammates. One of the assists, a perfect behind-the-back bounce pass from the paint to Al Horford waiting in the corner, has to be the most creative and bold assist of his career. Horford, who drilled seven 3-pointers, the most in a playoff game by a player 37 years old or older, knocked down the shot with 1:12 left, cutting the Pacers\u2019 lead to 111-109. Horford offered a fine quote about Tatum\u2019s pass when it was over: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty special \u2026 I don\u2019t know how he got it there, he had to improvise. He just continued to time after time make the right play. That was an unbelievable play.\u201d But Jaylen Brown, who has increasingly been working blue behind the microphone this postseason, had an even better \u2014 and more succinct \u2014 one: \u201cHang it in the [expletive] Louvre.\u201d It is important to note that Tatum, as extraordinary as he was (save for four missed free throws, if you really want to nitpick), did not need to do this alone, and better yet, he knew it. He trusted that Horford would be where he expected him to be. \u201cWe always talk about spacing, making sure we\u2019re in the right spots,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI trusted that he was going to be there, he trusted that I was going to make the right read. That was a hell of a shot that he made.\u201d And it was a hell of an effort by the Celtics starters. Brown scored 24 points on 10 of 18 shooting. Derrick White made a crucial late three and dished out 7 assists. Horford finished with 23 points and 3 blocks. Then there\u2019s Holiday, who was questionable to play after feeling under the weather and missing shootaround earlier Saturday. He was quiet early \u2013 he didn\u2019t score his first basket until late in the first half \u2014 but with the game hanging in the balance, he was the most energetic player on the court. In the final minute alone, Holiday converted a driving layup (off a Tatum pass), drew a foul, and hit the free throw to give the Celtics their first lead since the first quarter at 112-111. With 3.1 seconds left and the Celtics still up by the same score, he pounced on Andrew Nembhard\u2019s dribble and swiped the ball in a manner identical to what he did to Smart and the Celtics two years ago. Then Holiday sunk the free throws for the final margin, because that\u2019s what winning players do. I wish this guy played his whole career here, don\u2019t you? \u201cWhatever it takes,\u201d said Brown about the Celtics\u2019 mindset. \u201cOne game at a time. Play like a team. Win like a team. Lose like a team. Tonight, we just stayed with it, and now we\u2019re one game from getting back to the Finals.\u201d If for some reason you watch sports debate shows with the sound unmuted, you\u2019re aware that Tatum has received a ridiculous amount of scrutiny during a playoff run in which his team is now 11-2. It\u2019s usually a waste of effort to try to shame the shameless, but Tatum answered those critics, nitwits, and Kendrick Perkins in the best way possible. He played spectacularly and selflessly when his team was desperate for both. Saturday night, Jayson Tatum delivered the second-best performance of his playoff career. Fine, we\u2019ll add a caveat. It was his second-best performance \u2026 for now.", "summary": "<p>Maybe it\u2019s dangerous to rate such things in the immediate afterglow of a thrilling victory, but this victory over the Pacers will be remembered for a long time.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-celtics/2024/05/26/jayson-tatum-best-playoff-performances-celtics-pacers-game-3/\">Where does the Celtics\u2019 Game 3 win rank among Jayson Tatum\u2019s best playoff performances?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.boston.com\">Boston.com</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-celtics/2024/05/26/jayson-tatum-best-playoff-performances-celtics-pacers-game-3/", "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DV756GV3HV7R6MFSZQXOSX77EA-66533be8e9a52-768x432.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:59:32", "author": "Conor Roche", "authors": ["Conor Roche"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.05}

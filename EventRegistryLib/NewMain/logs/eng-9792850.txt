Barkley, who recently criticized the NBA, has been a key part of the success of the \"Inside The NBA\" show on TNT. However, the show will end after the next NBA season as TNT's bid for the broadcasting rights was turned down by the NBA. Despite this, the 1993 Most Valuable Player has emphasized the significance of the show for the NBA.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on Podcast P with Paul George, Barkley reflects on the legacy and what went wrong with 'Inside the NBA' as the show is about to conclude.\n\n\"It's been really depressing for me because we kind of knew we were gonna lose the thing. It was one of the worst kept secrets in the history of civilization. It just really sucks man. I can't believe we screwed it up. So next year is going to be a bittersweet year.\" Barkley said.\n\nBarkley expressed his disappointment that the show would be ending during a conversation with Paul George. Additionally, he said that since it would be their final year covering the NBA season, the upcoming year will be painful.\n\nIn the same podcast, Barkley shared his opinion on the performance of Philadelphia 76ers star player Joel Embiid at the 2024 Paris Olympics. The 61-year-old legend mentioned that Embiid's underwhelming performance for Team USA during the Olympics was due to his poor physical condition. Barkley feels that Embiid should take this into account.\n\n\"I hope this is a wake-up [call] for Joel, this Olympic experience. He has not played well and I'm hoping he's like, 'Yo man, I gotta get in better shape.' Me personally, I think that's one of the reasons he's always injured.\" Barkley said.\n\nIn addition to receiving criticism for his performance, Embiid was chastised for choosing to play for Team USA rather than France. Barkley's guidance may have a significant effect on Embiid's output. it could be interesting to see Embiid's performance against Brazil in the quarterfinal match on August 7.\n\nAlso Read: \"Everybody's Looking To Get Paid\"- Stephen A.

They were unable to match the offer presented by Amazon, according to the league itself, and as a result, the NBA will be leaving TNT after their contract expires at the conclusion of the 2025-26 season. Charles Barkley, one of the hosts of the award-winning Inside The NBA, has made his displeasure over the entire ordeal known.\n\nBarkley has already expressed his frustrations over how the negotiations between the two long-time partners broke down. And despite the last-ditch attempt from TNT to rescue its partnership with the NBA, Barkley knew that it was inevitable for his home network to lose the rights to cover the association.\n\n\"It's been really depressing for me because we kinda knew we were gonna lose the thing. It was one of the worst-kept secrets in the history of civilization,\" Barkley shared in an appearance on Podcast P with Paul George presented by Wave Sports + Entertainment.\n\nFor Charles Barkley, the most gut-wrenching part of this whole thing was witnessing his colleagues behind the scenes face the uncertainty of losing their job now that the NBA is leaving TNT.\n\n\"These people become part of your family. For 24 years, you know them, you know their kids, you know their husbands, you know their wives. That's what I feel really s****y about. ... They were like, 'I got a wife. I got kids.

However, Charles Barkley revealed that for TNT to extend its partnership with the NBA, they had to match the much-expensive offer package from ESPN and NBC instead of the least expensive one from Amazon.\n\nAll good things come to an end, but it certainly is disappointing for Barkley and the rest of the hard-workers over at TNT to lose their jobs over something that they did not have any control over.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jedd_pagaduan@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jedd Pagaduan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_on_TNT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA on TNT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Charles-Barkley-claims-TNT-losing-NBA-was-one-of-worst-kept-secrets-in-history-of-civilization.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792850", "eventUri": "eng-9792850", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

These people are so excited to have you in Philadelphia.\"\n\nBarkley played eight seasons of his NBA career with the 76ers and lives in the Philly area during the summertime. As a self-described \"diehard Sixer fan,\" he certainly joined in the fan base's excitement when the team added George on a four-year, $212 million contract in July. While on the podcast, the Hall of Famer also commended the Sixers' front office for their acquisitions of Caleb Martin, Andre Drummond, Reggie Jackson, and Eric Gordon.\n\n\"The Sixers have had the best summer of any team in the NBA,\" he said, echoing a sentiment he shared with The Inquirer last month in Tahoe. \" ... I cannot wait for the season to start.\"\n\n\" READ MORE: Charles Barkley rips the NBA, TNT files lawsuit after TV deals went to Amazon, NBC, and ESPN\n\nThough George doesn't appear to need much more advice on how to handle Philly fans -- he asked them to \"be as critical and as hard as you can\" in his introductory press conference last month, received some pointers from fan favorite Tyrese Maxey, and has already met some while out and about in the city -- Barkley offered his thoughts.\n\n\"I know you played in Indiana and they got a great fan base, but New York, Philly, and Boston -- they're different animals,\" Barkley told George. \"They love you, but they can turn to hate really quickly. But if you give 110 percent ... they're gonna love you. They want this team to win so badly.\"\n\nJoel Embiid's struggles for the United States in the Paris Olympics have already drawn plenty of criticism, and Barkley added to it during his discussion with George. He wants Embiid to take his second-half benching against Serbia, and his subsequent DNP against South Sudan, as fuel for the 2024-25 NBA season.\n\n\"I hope this is a wake-up [call] for Joel, this Olympic experience,\" Barkley said. \"He has not played well, and I'm hoping he's like, 'Yo, man, I gotta get in better shape. ... I gotta get healthy, because if we don't win the championship or go deep in the playoffs, it's going to be because of me.'\"\n\n\" READ MORE: Mike Sielski: Sitting Joel Embiid against South Sudan was the right thing for Team USA. Time for him to understand that.\n\nGeorge and Barkley, each former Olympians, can relate to Embiid's discomfort while finding a role on a star-studded team. George, who won a gold medal with Team USA at the 2016 Summer Olympics, says his limited offensive duties allowed him to expend more energy on defense. In a recent conversation with Embiid, George advised his new teammate to be open-minded this summer.\n\n\"Just try to find a way to stay engaged and challenge yourself in a different way than you would do in the NBA,\" George recalls telling Embiid. \"We had a good talk about that.\"\n\nBarkley drew a comparison between Embiid's roles with Team USA and the Sixers. The 2023 NBA MVP is one of several capable options on the American roster, and while that's a different dynamic than the one Embiid is used to in Philly, his supporting cast next season will be the best it has been in a long time. Barkley hopes Embiid's Olympic experience will help him settle into a reduced role alongside George and Tyrese Maxey.\n\n\"He can't mope around,\" Barkley said. \"He's gotta be like, 'OK, it's Paul's night. OK, it's [Maxey]'s night. What can I do when I don't get the ball?'\"\n\nBarkley also shared stories of his earliest encounters with the Sixers, which began in the lead up to the 1984 NBA draft. The Sixers had interest in selecting the Auburn product with the No. 5 overall pick, but Harold Katz, then the team's owner, wanted Barkley to shed a few pounds from the 300-pound frame he held coming out of college.\n\nBarkley lost the weight, but two days before the draft, his agent informed him that the Sixers were over the salary cap and thus would only be able to offer him a one-year contract for a mere $75,000.\n\n\"I'm like, 'Yo man, I didn't leave college for $75,000, that's crazy. ... Let's make sure the Sixers don't draft me,'\" Barkley recalls thinking. \"I went on an eating spree ... I fly into Philly, I'm like 299 [pounds]. The owner of the Sixers called me every name in the book. ... He put me on the train, we go up to New York ... I'm thinking I'm going to slip to six or seven and get me some good money.\"\n\n\" READ MORE: Charles Barkley praises Sixers for 'great summer,' and laments likely end of TNT's NBA broadcast rights\n\nThe Sixers drafted him anyway, and while that didn't please Barkley initially, it all worked out for him in the end. He impressed the team that summer, enough that they traded a couple of players so they could pay him a lucrative, multiyear contract.\n\nBarkley grew to be thankful that he landed in Philly. He called Billy Cunningham the \"best coach I've ever played for\" and commended the veterans on the team for taking him under their wing. He specifically credited Moses Malone for helping him through a difficult start to his rookie year, when Barkley was still out of shape and struggling to crack the Sixers' starting five.\n\n\"This whole thing changed my whole career,\" Barkley said of his relationship with Malone. \"One of the greatest players ever met me before practice, after practice, and he got me to lose 50 pounds. ... If it wasn't for Moses Malone ... I'd be working at McDonald's.\"\n\nBarkley finished his thought by imploring the 34-year-old George, who is entering his 15th NBA season, to be that same helpful veteran during his time with the Sixers.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_istvan@inquirer.com", "name": "Ben Istvan", "type": "author",

After providing entertainment and game analysis for decades, the group of Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal will have their last run together in the 2024-25 season. This is due to TNT losing the NBA's media rights to Amazon.\n\nWhen Barkley recently made an appearance on Podcast P with Paul George, he was asked about his experience on the show and whether any other TV network will be able to replicate the impact and longevity of Inside the NBA. In an elaborate answer, Barkley detailed what sets TNT apart from other networks like ESPN.\n\nBarkley outlined that a show like Inside the NBA can only be created if a network is willing to give a group a fair chance. Taking ESPN as an example, he explained that these networks have a very straightforward and an almost mechanical approach with what they create.\n\nThe Chuckster pointed out that ESPN throws a random group of people together and when the product fails for a few months, they don't care about giving it more time to grow. Instead, they take it off air.\n\nBarkley told PG and his crew, \"It's easy to say after 24 years how great our show has been. And I can't remember, but I' pretty sure we had some rocky roads in the beginning...I'm positive we had some rocky roads when Shaq first came on because it's always an adjustment.\"\n\nIn Barkley's opinion, the confidence to let one group try their best over an indefinite period of time helped create the incredible chemistry that we see in Inside the NBA. That's what sets TNT apart from ESPN.\n\nHowever, Barkley doesn't think ESPN will ever be patient for that long with the same group of people. That is why when the rumors of his show going off air started floating around, Chuck made it clear that he won't join another network.\n\nThe NBA's decision to part ways with Warner Bros. Discovery to give the media rights to Amazon was described by Barkley as the league prioritizing money over fans. Dejected by the news, Chuck released an official statement, putting his feelings into words.\n\nHe wrote, \"Clearly, the NBA has wanted to break up with us from the beginning. I'm not sure TNT ever had a chance. TNT matched the money. The league knows Amazon and these tech companies are the only ones willing to pay for the rights when they double in the future. The NBA didn't want to piss them off. It's a sad day when owners and commissioners choose money over the fans. It just sucks.\"\n\nAlthough it's a lost battle, TNT is not going down without a fight. They have filed a lawsuit in the New York state court in Manhattan, requesting the court to delay the new deal between the NBA and Amazon from going into effect.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "prateek_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Prateek Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_the_NBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inside the NBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Johnson_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ernie Johnson Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Interestingly, Paul George has gained recognition for his impressive Charles Barkley impression. What better way for the legendary Barkley to experience this tribute than by seeing it performed by the impersonator himself?\n\nPG-13 has been known to mimic the Round Mound of Rebound from time to time. One of the most iconic performances given by the nine-time All-Star was during his appearance on The Stephen A. Smith Show.\n\nAn old video of SAS and PG discussing the outcome of his former team turned into a hilarious one-minute span of the now-76ers star imitating the legend.\n\nHaving heard numerous stories of George's uncanny resemblance to Barkley's takes on live television, Smith got an absolute treat when he asked PG to give that answer in his best Charles Barkley impersonation.\n\nBeing drafted first overall by the Philadelphia 76ers back in 1985, Charles Barkley is a longtime supporter of the franchise. While he does rip the Sixers on their poor performances every now and then, Sir Charles seems to be quite optimistic about the team going forward, as per Inquirer.com.\n\n\"Now, they've just got to put it together. It's just on paper right now. It's got to work. Every season is different. And then, obviously, bringing [in that] many pieces, it's going to be an experiment. But, listen, they had a great summer.\"\n\nSpeaking on the 76ers being able to land George this summer, Barkley believes the team may be ready to cross all hurdles that have limited them in the past. However, it is still too early to speculate if this new core will work for Philly or not.\n\nPG is a versatile scorer who is a huge upgrade from Tobias Harris. Tyrese Maxey has developed into an All-Star guard that can score and facilitate the ball. And the team already has a former league MVP in Joel Embiid, one of the premier centers in the league right now.\n\nSo, will the Sixers have a successful run this year?

I don't think he's in good enough shape,\" Barkley shared. \"You got to be a little bit embarrassed by the way you played.\"\n\nBarkley made his disapproval clear, but to say the Sixers big man should be embarrassed is a bit of a stretch. In their final group phase game against Puerto Rico, Embiid recorded 15 points, 3 rebounds, 2 assists, and 2 blocks on 6 of 14 shooting. While it wasn't the most efficient game, it was arguably his best with Team USA. The superstar took it a step further once boos poured in during the final seconds of play.\n\nThe comment is a bit ironic, as it wasn't uncommon to hear Barkley and out of shape in the same sentence during his playing career.

TNT has contracts with MLB, the NHL, NASCAR, and U.S. men's and women's soccer.\n\nWhat are Charles Barkley's thoughts on Connor McDavid, Ryan Blaney, Bryce Harper, and Trinity Rodman?

By then, the Sixers window in the 1980s was shutting. However, Barley singled out Sixers legend Moses Malone for his influence on Barkley's playing career.\n\nBarkley explained why Malone was such a good influence on him on new Sixer Paul George's podcast, \"Podcast P with Paul George.\" He brought up one story when they first became teammates on the Sixers.\n\n\"The best thing happened to me... was Moses Malone,\" Barkley said. \"I was not getting to play. I was fat and out of shape. I asked Moses one day...Moses, can I come see you after practice? He says, sure, young fella. I said, 'Moses, why am I not getting to play?' He says, 'Son, you fat and you lazy.' He said, 'Son, you got a lot of talent, but you can't work hard because you're so fat.'\n\nBarkley then explained how Malone's brutal honesty changed everything for Barkley.\n\n\"This whole thing changed my whole career. One of the greatest players ever met me before practice after practice, and he got me to lose 50 pounds and the rest is history.\"\n\nBarkley was known for being heavier-set compared to most NBA stars. However, because he was an excellent athlete despite his mass, that played a role in why he became an NBA legend. Malone clearly helped him not get too heavy.\n\nBarkley also explained that had it not been for Malone, his career may have been different. He thinks he may have fallen so far off that he would have had to work a blue-collar job.\n\n\"If it wasn't for Moses Malone, man, I have zero idea. I'd be working at McDonald's, but that guy who was already one of the all-time greats. He took me on his wing. He worked with me every day before practice, after practice, he got me from 300 to 250 [pounds] and like I say, the rest is history. That's the best thing that ever happened to me in my NBA career- Moses Malone.\"\n\nMalone and Barkley played together from 1984 to 1986 before the Sixers traded Malone to Washington. The Sixers then traded Barkley to Phoenix in 1992, and Malone came back the following season. Malone won a title with the Sixers in 1983, while Barkley only made the NBA Finals once with the Suns in 1993.\n\nThough their efforts led to one title in Philadelphia, both Barkley's and Malone's numbers are retired by the Sixers. Both of them won multiple accolades during their time with the Sixers, including Most Valuable Player, though Barkley won it with the Suns.\n\nBarkley made the Eastern Conference Finals with the Sixers back when he was teammates with Malone on the Sixers. They lost to the Boston Celtics that year in 1986. Barkley never got that close again with the Sixers, but he played long enough for the franchise to keep them in the playoffs.\n\nFrom the horse's mouth, Barkley may not have become the legend he did without Malone's help.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_john@heavy.com", "name": "Matt John", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moses Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McDonald's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2153107950-e1722891704340.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792850", "eventUri": "eng-9792850", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

He reflected on his 24-year tenure and the significant impact the show has had on his life and the lives of his colleagues. He shared his emotional struggle, knowing that the show might be coming to an end. The staff had a strong sense that this would happen, and it wasn't a well-kept secret.\n\n\"The people, because you got to understand some, if you've been at the same job for 24 years, when I got there, some of them people didn't have kids. Then you say, man, they graduated high school. Now they've graduated college. And you're like, man, the first time you came in here, you were like six years old.\"\n\n\"Then the next time I saw you, you were in high school going to the prom, then you were like off to college, and now they've all graduated from college. So these people become part of your family. We work one day a week doing the regular season.\"\n\n\"But during the playoffs, we like, we work like every night for like two straight months. If you see the same people for two straight months, you're like, for 24 years, you know them, you know their kids, you know their husbands, you know their wives.\"\n\n\"That's what I feel really s***y about. Because, you know, I was telling somebody the other night, we were sitting around smoking cigars, and I said, yo, man, this has been really depressing for me because we kind of knew we were going to lose the thing. I mean, it was one of the worst kept secrets in the history of civilization.\"\n\n\"We were traveling for the conference finals, and then we did a couple of games on NBA TV in the finals. I was taking everybody out, trying to keep their spirits up, and they were like, man, I'm married. I got a wife. I got kids. I got a mortgage. And I ain't got no job. It really hurt me that people of my friends was talking like that.\"\n\n\"And I was like, man, I ain't never been in that situation in my life where I was going to lose my job and I had a family to take care of. And it was really heartbreaking. It just really sucks, man. And I can't believe we screwed it up. So next year is going to be a bittersweet year.\"\n\nBarkley emphasized the deep bonds formed with his colleagues over the years. He mentioned that many of the staff members had started their families during their time on the show, watching their children grow up. The close-knit nature of the team made the potential end of the show even more poignant. Barkley found it heartbreaking to hear his friends express their fears about job security, something he had never personally experienced to that extent.\n\nBarkley also talked about the legal battle between TNT and the NBA regarding broadcasting rights.\n\n\"So we filed a lawsuit. What I think and I'm what I'm talking about. I think the NBA said you can match, but they met ESPN or NBC. You don't get the match the Amazon offer. I'm sure with Adam Silver... yeah, y'all had the right to match, but it had to match NBC or ESPN because when we said y'all could match, Amazon didn't exist.\"\n\n\"I don't think Adam would leave himself open to lose a lawsuit. He was a lawyer and I think he's too smart. We have filed a lawsuit, but I think the NBA is like, yes, too late, we don't care. You guys sued to get the Amazon package.\"\n\n\"But when we signed the original deal like six, eight years ago, y'all had to match NBC or ESPN, which is like another 500 million a year. And I think our people like, we're going to try to match the cheapest one. And Adam's like, yeah, that's not going to work. Y'all could match, but y'all had to match the bigger number.\"\n\n\"So I don't think Adam is dumb enough where he would open this up to lose that lawsuit. First of all, I'm not even sure why we sued. Hey, they want to break up with us. I don't want no woman who I gotta sue to say, hey, you gotta stay with me. No, all right, now kick rocks, girl.\"\n\nHe explained that TNT had filed a lawsuit to retain the rights to broadcast NBA games, competing against offers from other networks like ESPN and NBC. Barkley doubted the lawsuit's success, given NBA Commissioner Adam Silver's legal expertise and the unlikelihood of Silver making a mistake that could lead to a loss in court.\n\nReflecting on the situation, Barkley questioned the rationale behind the lawsuit, suggesting that if the NBA wanted to move on, perhaps it was better to let them. He expressed a pragmatic view, likening the situation to a relationship where one party wants to end things, implying that it might be better to accept the breakup rather than fight it.\n\nOverall, Barkley's reflections highlight the deep personal connections formed over the years and the complex emotions surrounding the potential end of \"Inside The NBA.\" He emphasized the familial bonds with his colleagues and the challenges they face as they contemplate an uncertain future.\n\nRelated: Charles Barkley Calls Out The NBA And Says That He Will Leave TNT If They Do Not Pay His $210 Million Contract In Full\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

They have added so much depth to their roster that it will be difficult to discard them as a title contender next season. However, Charles Barkley believes that there's still one missing piece in the puzzle. And that's Joel Embiid's form.\n\nSir Charles recently joined the newest star member of the 76ers, Paul George on Podcast P with Paul George. The Philly legend gave major props to the 76ers' management for getting the biggest draw in free agency, as well as other players who will help the team contend for the title. But that could be a tough journey judging by the poor performances that Embiid has had in the Olympics.\n\nBarkley said that the seven-time All-Star's failure in Paris should act as a wakeup call for him and the Philadelphia franchise as they can't afford to mess up another season.\n\nBarkley straight up told PG, \"I hope this is a wake-up [call] for Joel, this Olympic experience. He has not played well and I'm hoping he's like, 'Yo man, I gotta get in better shape.' Me personally, I think that's one of the reasons he's always injured.\"\n\nIn Chuck's assessment, Embiid is not adequately fit, which is why he often finds himself warming the bench due to injuries. Barkley said that there's a lot of scope for improvement as far as Embiid's physical conditioning is concerned and his failure in the Olympics should work as a sign for him to get in better shape.\n\nEmbiid has played two games so far in Paris, one against Serbia and the other against Puerto Rico. In the Serbia game, he played 11 minutes and had four points while shooting two of five from the field. The rest of his scorecard featured two rebounds, one block and no assists and steals.\n\nHe did redeem himself a bit in the last game with a 15-3-2 score line. But he shot 6-of-14 from the field.\n\nSir Charles believes that if the 76ers wish to have a real shot at the title next season, they will need their star player to be at his absolute best. Otherwise, they might fail to make any major impact in the league.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "prateek_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Prateek Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/08/3e2c627c-nba-2024-08-05t214519.770.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792850", "eventUri": "eng-9792850", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

He has not played well, and I'm hoping he's like, 'Yo man, I got to get in better shape' cuz I think that's one of the reasons he's always injured.\"\n\nBarkley's message to Embiid\n\nEmbiid's performances in the Paris Olympics have drawn plenty of criticism, with guys like Colin Cowherd saying JoJo is hindering Team USA's offense.\n\nThe 2023 NBA MVP has averaged 9.5 points, 2.5 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks in two games. Even though those numbers are solid, Embiid has looked sluggish every time he stepped on the floor.\n\n\"I don't think he's in good enough shape,\" added Barkley. \"But I think the way he's played, which was not well during the Olympics, should be a wake-up call for him, like, 'You know what? I gotta be in better shape. I got to get healthy because if we don't win the championship or go deep in the playoffs, it's going to be because of me.'\"\n\nLegler said that this could be the Sixers' year\n\nEmbiid has a long history of postseason failures, as he's never taken the Sixers past the second round of the NBA playoffs. But with George joining him and Tyese Maxey next season, ESPN's Tim Legler believes that the Sixers are a legit threat to win it all next campaign.\n\n\"If they don't figure it out with this group they never will because they have everything that they need now,\" Legler said. \"Anything short of the championship should be considered a disappointment. There is no question. The time is now. There'd been 41 parades in the NBA since the Sixers last had one. They're ready. The city is ready. They're ready to erupt...Philadelphia is a basketball city, and they are starving for a champion. They might finally have enough pieces to get that done.\"\n\nLas Vegas oddsmakers give the Sixers the third-best odds to win the 2025 NBA championship, with only the Boston Celtics and Denver Nuggets ahead. However, they will go as far as Embiid takes them. And for him to be the No.1 guy on a championship contender, the big man needs to be better.\n\nRelated: Rasheed Wallace suggests Joel Embiid focus on the Sixers, not Team USA: \"This NBA title is more important than getting that gold medal\"", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shane_garry_acedera@postandcourier.com", "name": "Shane Garry Acedera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Legler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Legler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasheed_Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rasheed Wallace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792850", "eventUri": "eng-9792850", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

During his interview with George, Barkley explained why he still expects the United States team to win a gold medal.\n\nBarkley acknowledged that some great players such as Giannis Antetokounmpo and Nikola Jokic play for foreign countries, but that still doesn't change that the U.S. has the best depth.\n\n\"We still got the next 10 best players in every game. Well probably 12. So this notion that yeah, the international teams, they have gotten better. They are, but we still got the best players in the world. When we go to our bench, there's nobody bringing a Jayson Tatum or Jrue Holiday or [Tyrese] Haliburton or Derrick White. Those foreign teams ain't bringing no dudes off the bench that good. I guarantee you that,\" Barkley said. \"Listen I don't even know every country, ain't nobody bringing nobody off the bench better than Jayson Tatum okay? Ain't nobody bringing anybody off the bench better than Kevin Durant. So this notion, yeah, the international teams have gotten better, but there's never an excuse for the United States not to win the gold medal. We got the best team, we got the best players by far.\"\n\nBarkley makes a great point.

On a team that boasts the likes of LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Kevin Durant, among other superstars of similar caliber, it's very easy to fall through the cracks and go unnoticed. This is something that Paul George thought that his new Philadelphia 76ers teammate, Joel Embiid might face in Paris. Therefore, PG advised him a way out.\n\nOn Podcast P with Paul George, George was in conversation with Charles Barkley when the two started discussing how Joel Embiid has had a few poor games for Team USA on this Olympics run. PG revealed that he had a conversation with Embiid recently when he gave the 2023 NBA MVP some advice on staying relevant in that stacked squad.\n\nGeorge said that it's difficult to see success with Team USA while following the same formula as the NBA. That's why he believes Embiid needs to make a few changes.\n\nPG said, \"I had a conversation with him [Joel] not too long ago...It's a different dynamic when you play Team USA...It's a little bit of a different thing that I think he's going through because there's so much talent on the floor.\"\n\nCiting his own experience during the 2o16 Olympics in Rio, PG said that Embiid needs to do things differently to remain a valuable member of the team. He said, \"When I played on that 2016 team, my mindset was more so geared towards, I'mma pick dudes up 94 feet, I'mma pressure the hell out of whoever I'm guarding. I don't do that in the NBA.\"\n\nPG advised Embiid to find something different to contribute on that team full of superstars. Because players on the team won't just pass him the ball like they do in Philly.\n\nTherefore, Embiid has to find ways to hustle for the basketball to get more shots and more opportunities.\n\nWhile Charles Barkley agreed with PG's point, he had a different perspective on why Embiid is performing poorly on the team.\n\nThe Philly legend said that Embiid isn't in great shape. As it was the case with him during the NBA season as well, Embiid's subpar fitness level has made him inconsistent with his performances.\n\nBarkley said that now the 76ers have a great team to contend for the title, and if Embiid doesn't get himself in perfect shape, he will be the one to be blamed if they lose again next season.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "prateek_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Prateek Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/08/97f0715e-nba-2024-08-05t230604.056.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792850", "eventUri": "eng-9792850", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

These people become part of your family,\" the 1993 NBA MVP relayed.\n\nRelated: Oscar Schmidt shares how beating Team USA after a miraculous 35-point second-half performance was 'the best part of his life'\n\nFriends losing their jobs\n\nWith the NBA agreeing on a brand-new $76 billion broadcast deal with ESPN/ABC, NBCU, and Amazon Prime Video, TNT will lose its NBA broadcasting rights after the 2024-25 season. The news also means that 'Inside the NBA' will likely end on TNT. While this development will not mean the end of Barkley's media career, he feels crappy about the uncertain futures of his co-workers.\n\n\"I was taking everybody out, trying to keep their spirits up, and they were like, 'Man, I'm married. I got a wife, I got kids, I got a mortgage, and I ain't got no job,'\" Charles narrated. \"It really hurt me. It really hurt me that people, my friends, were talking like that. I was like, 'Man, I ain't never been in that situation in my life where I was going to lose my job, and I had a family to take care of.'\"\n\nWhile Charles and the rest of the 'Inside the NBA' crew enjoy their last dance, Barkley stresses that next season will be a \"bittersweet year,\" knowing full well that his colleagues may not find work elsewhere. While he may be financially secure, he knows that many of his co-workers are not as fortunate.\n\nRelated: \"There's probably going to be 200 people who lose their jobs\" - Charles Barkley on his main concern about TNT losing NBA TV rights", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonas_panerio@postandcourier.com", "name": "Jonas Panerio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_the_NBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inside the NBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Johnson_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ernie Johnson Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN_on_ABC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN on ABC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Network"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792850", "eventUri": "eng-9792850", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Whereas teams before considered it an immense honor to share the floor with legendary American basketball players like Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, and Larry Bird, now it's a chance for teams to prove themselves against the best in the world. And even though Team USA has still been dominant in the last four Olympic basketball tournaments, the competition's knockout format opens the possibility of an upset.\n\nCharles Barkley, a Hall of Famer and current basketball analyst, recently joked about the consequences for Team USA if they lost in the Paris Olympics. During an interview with Paul George, Chuck quipped that losing in the Olympics would mean not being able to come back to the country.\n\nInternational teams have gotten better\n\n\"Sir Charles,\" a two-time Olympic gold medal winner, is certain that foreign teams and their players have improved by leaps and bounds. You don't even have to look too far for proof of this, as some of the top NBA players are now from different countries. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Luka Doncic, and Nikola Jokic are all examples of international players who have risen to become superstars in the league.\n\nAt the same time, Chuck emphasized that despite this development, international squads still aren't better than Team USA.\n\n\"You take away Joker, Giannis, and Luka, all three of whom are great players. If I'm missing someone, let's not forget Shai -- Shai is great also. But we still have the next ten best players in every game, probably even 12,\" Barkley said on \"Podcast P.\"\n\nTeam USA's biggest strength in any international competition, especially the Olympics, is its depth. While the team starts superstars like LeBron, Steph Curry, and Devin Booker, the drop-off in talent -- if any -- is barely noticeable when the Americans go to their second unit, with All-Stars like Kevin Durant, Bam Adebayo, and Anthony Davis coming off the bench.\n\n\"When we go to our bench, there's nobody bringing a Jason Tatum or a Jrue Holiday or a Haliburton or a Derrick White. Those foreign teams aren't bringing dudes off the bench that are that good. I guarantee you that,\" Charles added. \"I don't know about every country, but ain't nobody bringing anybody off the bench better than Jason Tatum. Ain't nobody bringing anybody off the bench better than Kevin Durant.\"\n\nRelated: Oscar Schmidt shares how beating Team USA after a miraculous 35-point second-half performance was 'the best part of his life'\n\nNo excuse not to win the gold medal\n\nGeorge, a gold medal winner in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, chimed in on the discussion, saying that while international teams have several fantastic players, the U.S. is the only team that has the complete package.\n\n\"When you look at it, Canada, in particular, has amazing guard play, and I think Canada is probably one of the better teams that could give USA a real shot if they can put it together. But top to bottom, their guard play is great, but they just aren't big enough,\" PG explained. \"You look at France; they've got the size, but they don't have the guard play. You can't find international teams that can put it all together the way the USA team can.\"\n\nChuck stopped short of guaranteeing gold for the United States and joked that Team USA must win the entire thing or risk not being welcomed back home.\n\n\"I just don't see how, if we're locked in, there's any shot at USA losing. If they lose, we can't let them back in the country. They can't come back because, with the team we've got, there's no excuse to lose the gold medal,\" Barkley said.\n\nWith a quarterfinal game against Brazil looming, the Americans must stay focused on the ultimate prize. If not, they better believe Charles would be at the airport, trying to ensure they don't get past immigration.\n\nRelated: Charles Barkley sends a warning to Joel Embiid amid disappointing Olympic

The Americans won all three of their games in group play convincingly, and now, they're set up nicely for a run to the championship game, as they would play Brazil in the quarters and either Australia or a Serbia team they already beat in the semis.\n\nAll of this is coming in a tournament that was billed as a potentially serious challenge for the United States, which has won gold in each of the last four Summer Olympics. Perhaps that will still end up being the case, but on the latest episode of Podcast P, both Charles Barkley and Paul George expressed their belief that the U.S. should be able to take care of business -- and if not, Barkley said, something serious needs to happen.\n\n\"Have the international teams gotten better? One-hundred percent,\" Barkley said. \"They still not better than the United States. You take away Joker, and Giannis, and Luka, all three guys are great, great players. Shai is great, also. But we still got the next 10 best players in every game. Ain't nobody bringing nobody off the bench better than Jayson Tatum, ain't nobody bringing anybody off the bench better than Kevin Durant. The international teams have gotten better, but there's never an excuse for the United States not to win a gold medal. We got the best team, we got the best players, by far.\"\n\nGeorge then identified Canada as a team that can challenge the U.S. due to their guards, but expressed his belief that they don't have enough size. He said the inverse about France, which has great bigs but guards that really struggle.\n\n\"You can't find teams internationally that can put it all together the way a USA team can,\" George said. \"If we're locked in, there's no shot that USA loses.\"\n\n\"Listen, if they lose, we can't let 'em back in the country,\" Barkley replied. \"We can't.

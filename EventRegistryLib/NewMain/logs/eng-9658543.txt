The reigning Copa America champions would become the first team to go back-to-back in the historic tournament since Chile did so (against Argentina) in 2015 and 2016. Judging by the current form of their competition, Argentina might not lose a match the entire summer.\n\nHere's 90min's guide to Argentina at Copa America 2024.\n\nThere are not many surprises in Lionel Scaloni's final 26-man squad for Argentina ahead of Copa America 2024. The team is a balanced blend of young talent, like Manchester City's Julian Alvarez and Manchester United's Alejandro Garnacho, and some of the best players to ever suit up for La Albiceleste, including their captain, Lionel Messi.\n\nFortunately for the reigning Copa America champions, Lisandro Martinez is finally fully fit after several injuries kept him off the pitch for virtually the entire 2023/24 season. The Manchester United defender can play alongside Benfica's Nicolas Otamendi or Tottenham's Cristian Romero on Argentina's backline.\n\nAngel Correa, Leonardo Balerdi, and Valentin Barco were cut from the final squad ahead of the tournament.\n\nArgentina should progress through their Group Stage fixtures quite comfortably. La Albiceleste open the tournament against Canada, who have managed just two wins in their last seven matches.\n\nThen, Chile awaits Messi and his side at MetLife Stadium. Although La Roja had great success against Argentina at Copa America 2015 and Copa America 2016, their squad does not pose nearly as big a threat as the current Argentina starting XI.\n\nPeru is the last test for Argentina in Group A, and barring a major upset, they should not be able to take any points from Lionel Scaloni's men. Expect to see Argentina comfortably atop their group come June 30.\n\nArgentina are undeniably on the easier side of the Copa America 2024 bracket. While the USA, Brazil, Uruguay, and Colombia are all fated to play one another in the quarter-finals or semifinals, Argentina will meet the runners-up of Group B, likely Ecuador or Venezuela.\n\nThe next test for La Albiceleste comes in the semifinals where they will presumably face Mexico. Still, they should be able to defeat El Tri and make it to another Copa America final.\n\nArgentina would not meet Brazil until July 14 should the Selecao make it to the final.\n\nWhen Argentina are playing, Lionel Messi is always going to be the most must-see player on the pitch. Although the Inter Miami forward missed a handful of MLS games in the last few months with various injuries, he is fit and ready to go come June 20.\n\nUnlike in previous Copa America tournaments, Argentina's captain finally has a worthy supporting cast. Enzo Fernandez, who also is just coming back from a lengthy injury, will once again shine in the midfield, especially alongside Alexis Mac Allister.\n\nWhether Lionel Scaloni opts for Julian Alvarez or Lautaro Martinez to play with Messi and Angel Di Maria, he has two pure goalscorers that can fit seamlessly into the No. 9 position for Argentina.\n\nIt is hard to imagine a scenario in which Argentina does not win back-to-back Copa Americas. The reigning World Cup champions have only lost two matches in the last two years, and the chemistry of their starting XI is unmatched.\n\nOn paper, Brazil seem to be the only squad that could give them a true challenge, but the Selecao's midfield simply cannot compete with Argentina's.\n\nAs long as Argentina perform to their potential, they will lift the historic Copa America trophy in the United States this summer.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Under new management with Jesse Marsch, it will be a massive uphill battle for them to get an upset result in the first match of the tournament.\n\nUnderstandably, FIFA's top-ranked side Argentina -- defending Copa America champions and fresh off a World Cup crown -- are the strong favorites to win this year's competition as the tournament gets under way.\n\nBrazil are right there as second-favorites, but that's largely on brand recognition as they enter the competition in significant turmoil and without injured talisman Neymar. The in-form South American sides are Uruguay and Colombia, while hosts USA and fellow CONCACAF giants Mexico are amongst the second tier of title contenders but will have to prove their worth.\n\nBelow are all the completed matches at the 2024 Copa America to this point in the competition.

Vinicius Jr for Ballon d'Or? Copa America set to start - Realnews Magazine", "body": "THE Copa America 2024 starts on Thursday - with something of a different look.\n\nBut the stars are familiar, with Lionel Messi and Vinicius Jr looking to add to their trophy hauls.\n\nSouth America's continental championship will be played in the United States.\n\nAnd six of the 16 teams are from the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (Concacaf).\n\nIt was also the same for the special edition 2016 Copa America Centenario - but this is the first regular staging of the tournament to be played outside of the continent.\n\nMany of the host cities are in southern states such as California, Texas and Florida - but there are stadia further north too including in New Jersey.\n\nThe tournament is being seen as preparation for the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted by the United States - along with Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe US, Mexico, Jamaica, Canada, Costa Rica and Panama will be the six North and Central American countries joining all 10 South American nations to compete.\n\nUS boss Gregg Berhalter is under big pressure, with some fans calling for him to go following a 5-1 warm-up defeat by Colombia.\n\n\"I don't think I'm the right person to answer that question,\" he said when asked about his future.\n\n\"But what I would say is that we do see this as a building block. We see this group as a talented group that's able to do good things, and we want to use Copa America to show that we're focused on going as far as we can.\"\n\nMost Copas since 1993 have had 12 countries, including two guests - with Japan and Qatar having played in past editions - but the last one in 2021 just had the 10 South American nations.Media caption,\n\nUSA's Ricardo Pepi and Mark McKenzie discuss Copa America\n\nIt could prove to be a final international tournament for one of football's legends, Argentina forward Lionel Messi, 36. But we have said that before.\n\nThe Inter Miami player will turn 39 during the next World Cup in two years.\n\nAsked about the 2026 World Cup, he said recently: \"It depends on how I feel, how I am physically and knowing whether I'm at the level to be able to compete and help my team-mates.\n\n\"There is still a long time until the tournament, but it goes quickly. I don't know how I will be in that moment.\"\n\nMessi is aiming for a third winners' medal in a row for his country, after the 2021 Copa America and 2022 World Cup, having never won a senior international tournament until the age of 34.\n\nThe final will be played at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami - which is just over 20 miles from the city of Fort Lauderdale, where Messi's club currently play.\n\nArgentina could become the most decorated Copa America side ever if they win the title again. They are currently joint top with Uruguay on 15 trophies.\n\nBrazil are the second favourites to win the Copa America, behind Argentina.\n\nThe 2019 champions are bidding to lift the trophy for the 10th time - and the fourth this century. Nobody else bar Argentina and Uruguay have won more than two.\n\nAmong their best hopes of winning the tournament are forwards Vinicius Jr, Rodrygo and Endrick - who will all be Real Madrid team-mates next season.\n\nVinicius Jr is the favourite to win the Ballon d'Or after helping Real win La Liga and the Champions League - with team-mate Jude Bellingham of England also thought to be in contention.\n\nCould a continental tournament for either player this summer be a deciding factor?\n\nEndrick, who has scored three goals in five caps, will join Real Madrid from Palmeiras once he turns 18, a week after the Copa America final.\n\nJourneyman 62-year-old manager Dorival Junior has only been in charge since January.\n\nUruguay are managed by Leeds United legend Marcelo Bielsa, who is hoping at the age of 68 to win the Copa America for the first time.\n\nBielsa was so close in 2004 when he was managing his native Argentina.\n\nCesar Delgado had put the Argentines 2-1 up against Brazil in the 87th minute but Adriano netted in injury time and Brazil won on penalties in Lima.\n\nThat was the last time he was at the Copa America.\n\nBielsa managed Chile for almost four years but joined just after the 2007 Copa and left months before the 2011 tournament.\n\nThere are four groups of four teams, with the two top from each group going into the quarter-finals.\n\nThe tournament starts with Argentina v Canada on 20 June in Atlanta, and ends with the final in Miami on 14 July.", "source": {"uri": "realnewsmagazine.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Realnews Magazine"},

Defending champions Argentina will take on debutants Canada in the opening match at the Mercedes Benz Stadium in Atlanta. The Group A encounter kicks off at 5:30 AM IST on June 21. All Copa America 2024 matches will be live-streamed in India.\n\nCopa America 2024 will see 16 top football teams from the Americas battle it out for the title in the tournament's 48th edition. The teams have been divided into four groups. Copa America 2024 Groups:\n\nGroup A: Argentina, Peru, Chile, Canada. Group B: Mexico, Ecuador, Venezuela, Jamaica.\n\nGroup C: United States, Uruguay, Panama, Bolivia. Group D: Brazil, Colombia, Paraguay, Costa Rica\n\nThe top two teams from the four groups will progress to the quarter-finals. The Copa America 2024 final is slated to take place at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami on July 15. Fourteen stadiums across the US will host the Copa America matches. The USA also hosted the 2016 edition, which Chile won after defeating Argentina on penalties after a goalless final.\n\nUruguay, the joint-most successful team in the Copa America alongside Argentina with 15 titles, are placed in Group C alongside hosts USA. The Marcelo Bielsa-coached side will be looking to Federico Valverde and Darwin Nunez to help them win the title for the first time since 2011. Lionel Messi's Argentina, meanwhile, are chasing their third major international title on-the-trot after winning the Copa America 2021 and FIFA World Cup 2022.\n\nNine-time champions Brazil are in Group D and will look to move on from their heartbreaking loss to arch-rivals Argentina in the last Copa America final at the Maracana Stadium. Though missing superstar Neymar due to injury, the Real Madrid duo of Vinicius Jr and Rodrygo, along with young sensation Endrick, will look to impress.\n\nColombia, with experienced James Rodriguez and Luis Diaz in their ranks, will also look to challenge for the title.

Vinicius Jr for Ballon d'Or? Copa America set to start", "body": "The Copa America 2024 starts on Thursday in a different continent.\n\nThere are some different teams from past editions but the stars are familiar, with Lionel Messi and Vinicius Jr looking to add to their trophy hauls.\n\nBBC Sport takes a closer look at the tournament.\n\nSouth America's continental championship will be played in the United States of America.\n\nAnd six of the 16 teams are from the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (Concacaf).\n\nIt was also the same for the special edition 2016 Copa America Centenario - but this is the first regular edition of the tournament to be played outside of the continent.\n\nMany of the host cities are in southern states such as California, Texas and Florida - but there are stadia further north too including in New Jersey.\n\nThe tournament is being seen as preparation for the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted by the United States - along with Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe US, Mexico, Jamaica, Canada, Costa Rica and Panama will be the six North American countries joining all 10 South American nations in the Copa America.\n\nMost Copas since 1993 have had 12 countries, including two guests - with Japan and Qatar having played in past editions - but the last one in 2021 just had the 10 South American nations.\n\nIt could prove to be a final international tournament for one of football's legends, Argentina forward Lionel Messi, 36. But we have said that before.\n\nThe Inter Miami player will turn 39 during the next World Cup in two years.\n\nAsked about the 2026 World Cup, he said recently: \"It depends on how I feel, how I am physically and knowing whether I'm at the level to be able to compete and help my team-mates.\n\n\"There is still a long time until the tournament, but it goes quickly. I don't know how I will be in that moment.\"\n\nMessi is aiming for a third winners' medal in a row for his country, after the 2021 Copa America and 2022 World Cup, having never won a senior international tournament until the age of 34.\n\nThe final will be played at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami - which is just over 20 miles from the city of Fort Lauderdale where Messi's club currently play.\n\nArgentina, meanwhile, could become the most decorated Copa America side ever if they win the title again. They are currently joint top with Uruguay on 15 trophies.\n\nBrazil are the second favourites to win the Copa America, behind Argentina.\n\nThe 2019 champions are bidding to lift the trophy for the 10th time - and the fourth this century. Nobody else bar Argentina and Uruguay have won more than two.\n\nAmong their best hopes of winning the tournament are forwards Vinicius Jr, Rodrygo and Endrick - who will all be Real Madrid team-mates next season.\n\nVinicius Jr is the favourite to win the Ballon d'Or after helping Real win La Liga and the Champions League - with team-mate Jude Bellingham of England also thought to be in contention.\n\nCould a continental tournament for either player this summer be a deciding factor?\n\nEndrick, who has scored three goals in five caps, will join Real Madrid from Palmeiras once he turns 18, a week after the Copa America final.\n\nJourneyman 62-year-old manager Dorival Junior has only been in charge since January.\n\nUruguay are managed by Leeds United legend Marcelo Bielsa, who is hoping at the age of 68 to win the Copa America for the first time.\n\nBielsa was so close in 2004 when he was managing his native Argentina.\n\nCesar Delgado had put the Argentines 2-1 up against Brazil in the 87th minute but Adriano netted in injury time and Brazil won on penalties in Lima.\n\nThat was the last time he was at the Copa America.\n\nBielsa managed Chile for almost four years but joined just after the 2007 Copa and left months before the 2011 edition.\n\nThere are four groups of four teams, with the two top from each group going into the quarter-finals.\n\nThe tournament starts with Argentina v Canada on 20 June in Atlanta, and ends with the final in Miami on 14 July.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [],

The news and editorial departments had no role in the creation or display of this content.\n\nLionel Messi and Argentina won the Copa America in 2021 for the first time in his career and for the first time as a country in 28 years. They then cemented their status as the best team in the world by winning the 2022 Qatar World Cup and are expected to make a deep run in the 2024 Copa America.\n\nHow will the defending champions and the G.O.A.T. handle the pressure to win again? Here are our Argentina odds and best bets for the 2024 Copa America:\n\n2024 Soccer Sportsbook Bonuses: Best Copa America Betting Apps & Promos\n\nREAD: 2024 Copa America odds, preview & picks\n\n2024 Argentina Copa America Odds, Preview: Messi looks to lead repeat\n\nArgentina sits atop the odds board for 2024 Copa America futures odds, which is hard to argue given their recent international success.\n\nBrazil is close behind in odds coming off a second-place finish in the 2021 Copa America and with a number of high-profile players, including two Champions League winners, Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo, in attack.\n\nUruguay sits alone in third in odds before a steep drop-off to a tier of contenders that includes Mexico, Colombia, USA and Ecuador.\n\nThe USA earned a 1-1 draw with Brazil on Wednesday to bounce back from a 5-1 loss against Colombia, while Ecuador is an interesting sleeper pick because of its young and talented squad.\n\nArgentina Copa America predictions: To win 2024 Copa America (+175 or better)\n\nThis is one of two closely-related bets that could work as hedges against one another (more on that in a moment).\n\nThe Argentinians left no doubt about their quality at either of their last two international competitions. Messi might be older and in the last few years of his career, but he's surrounded by players with immense quality in all three levels of the squad. They also won 12 of 13 matches since the World Cup Final, with the lone outlier being an 0-2 loss to Uruguay.\n\nThe defending champions are -300 to win their group and are on the much easier side of the bracket. They wouldn't have to face either Brazil or Uruguay until the final and would likely only need to beat the likes of Mexico and Ecuador to reach that point.\n\n2024 Argentina Copa America props: Argentina to finish as the runner-up (+340 or better)\n\nRemember the second of two hedge bets? Betting on Argentina to finish in second would ensure that bettors take home a profit as long as the champs are able to handle their business and get back to the final.\n\nArgentina's group includes Peru, Chile and Canada. They could also face any one of Mexico, Ecuador, Venezuela or Jamaica in the knockout, but all of those teams pale in comparison to the might of the reigning champions.\n\nHedging means that one of two bets is guaranteed to lose, and it's possible that both do. But it's also impossible to argue with Argentina's recent dominance, and everything is shaping up for them to have a fairly manageable run to the Final.\n\nLionel Messi odds for Copa America: Messi to win the Golden Boot (+300 or better)\n\nMessi won the Golden Boot at the 2021 Copa America with four goals. His five assists helped him take the tiebreaker from Colombia's Luis Diaz, who also found the back of the net four times.\n\nMessi is a mainstay in Argentina's attack and is also their penalty taker, which ensures that he'll be able to add \"cheap\" goals to his tally if any are available.\n\nLooking at Argentina's quality of opponent, and since we expect them to make the final, it's also likely that his team will score a lot of goals and get to play as many matches as possible, which will only help his chances.\n\nYou must be over 21 to play.

The betting odds have Argentina as a significant favorite.\n\nArgentina vs. Canada is the only match of the day, with the other Group A match, Peru vs. Chile, taking place on Friday.\n\nArgentina is not only a massive favorite in this match, but also in Group A. Argentina is -400 to win the group, which does not feature any of the other top seven teams in the odds to win the tournament.\n\nLionel Messi will get plenty of attention throughout the tournament, but it's a different type of attention than he has been receiving in recent years. Gone is the pressure to win with Argentina. Argentina finally ended a 28-year trophy drought with the 2021 Copa America and then won the World Cup a year later. Now it's a question of how many more tournaments the 36-year-old (who turns 37 on Monday) will play for Argentina. Could this be his last Copa America?\n\nWe're looking at what the odds predict for the match and what we're anticipating from each team.\n\nIt's clear Argentina is a massive favorite for this match. Anything other than an Argentina win would be a shock. Even a one-goal win would be a minor surprise.\n\nArgentina is the top-ranked team in the world, coming off two major trophies. Canada lost all three matches at the 2022 World Cup that Argentina won.\n\nWhile this is a transcendent time for Argentina, it's an important period for Canada. While the 2022 World Cup did not go well, it's significant that they made it for the first time since 1986. Canada followed that up by making the final of the CONCACAF Nations League in 2023. This tournament represents a major test two years out from sharing hosting duties for the 2026 World Cup.\n\nCanada has a genuine world-class player in Alphonso Davies, and several others are playing at high levels in Europe. The talent isn't anywhere near the level of Argentina, but there is talent.\n\nThis is Canada's first Copa America appearance.

The Marcelo Bielsa-coached side will be looking to Federico Valverde and Darwin Nunez to help them win the title for the first time since 2011.\n\nLionel Messi's Argentina, meanwhile, are chasing their third major international title on-the-trot after winning the Copa America 2021 and FIFA World Cup 2022.\n\nNine-time champions Brazil are in Group D and will look to move on from their heartbreaking loss to arch-rivals Argentina in the last Copa America final at the Maracana Stadium.\n\nThough missing superstar Neymar due to injury, the Real Madrid duo of Vinicius Jr and Rodrygo, along with young sensation Endrick, will look to impress.\n\nColombia, with experienced James Rodriguez and Luis Diaz in their ranks, will also look to challenge for the title.", "source": {"uri":

Argentina and Uruguay are tied with 15 Copa titles each, followed by Brazil with nine. No other nation has won more than two. The United States is among six teams from North and Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Lionel Messi and Argentina will try to match Spain's feat of three consecutive major titles when the Copa America kicks off Thursday night.\n\nComing off championships in the 2021 Copa America and the 2022 World Cup, Messi will be four days shy of his 37th birthday when the Albiceleste take the field against Canada at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.\n\n\"I want to enjoy a couple of more matches being a world champion,\" Messi said after Argentina beat France on penalty kicks to win the 2022 World Cup final.\n\nHe has 10 goals in 10 international appearances since, raising his total to 108 in 182 games for Argentina's national team. He is either tied for second with Ali Daei or one behind, depending on whether a disputed goal by the Iranian is counted, trailing only Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo at 128.\n\n\"It is not easy to compete again after winning it all,\" Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said.\n\nArgentina and Uruguay are tied with 15 Copa titles each, followed by Brazil with nine. No other nation has won more than two.\n\nBrazil features an attack headed by Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior and Rodrygo, just off a Champions League title with Real Madrid, and Raphinha. The emerging star is 17-year-old Endrick, who joins Real Madrid this summer.\n\n\"If you look at every position in their proposed starting 11, it's probably one of the world's best players,\" U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter said.\n\nSpain is the only nation to win three consecutive major titles: the European Championship in 2008 and 2012 around the 2010 World Cup.\n\nA look at the tournament:\n\nExpanded fieldThere will be 16 teams, just as in 2016. The U.S., Mexico, Canada, Costa Rica, Panama and Jamaica join the 10 South American nations after qualifying from North and Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nBack in the USAEcuador was to host the tournament under the rotation of CONMEBOL, South American soccer's governing body, but declined. The tournament was then moved to the U.S., which also hosted the special centennial Copa America in 2016 as Chile won on penalty kicks over Argentina at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\nEleven NFL stadiums are being used, including eight of the 11 U.S. venues for the 2026 World Cup, plus three smaller MLS homes. The final will be at Miami Gardens, Florida, on July 14, starting five hours after the European Championship final in Berlin.\n\nCONMEBOL says more than 1 million tickets have been sold for the 32 matches. The 2016 tournament drew just under 1.5 million, and the 2019 tournament in Brazil about 850,000. The 2021 Copa was played mostly without fans because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nU.S. teamThis will be the biggest test for the U.S. team before the World Cup -- the Americans get an automatic berth as co-host along with Mexico and Canada -- and most Europe-based players are expected to skip next year's CONCACAF Gold Cup.\n\nChristian Pulisic, Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie are the core of a team that returns 18 players from the 2022 World Cup roster.\n\n\"A World Cup on home soil is the biggest thing that you know we'll probably do in our career,\" Pulisic said. \"It's a special time for this sport in America.\"\n\nWorld Cup test?In 2016, CONMEBOL partnered with the U.S. Soccer Federation, which was in charge of most of the logistics. This time, CONMEBOL is co-organizing the tournament with CONCACAF, the governing body of North and Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nUnlike during the World Cup, the organizers have only short-term access to venues. At Hard Rock, a concert is scheduled for July 6, between the last group stage game and the final, and a new grass surface will be installed.\n\nAt MetLife Stadium, where a semifinal will be played July 9, staff will look at it as a preview for the World Cup final on July 19, 2026. The stadium has a camera system designed by Arecont Vision and managed by Genetec Security Center that was installed before the 2014 Super Bowl and a new system by Axis Communications is being put in place this summer in the seating bowl with 80 8K, 41-megapixel cameras.\n\n\"We can see every seat all the time. I think it serves as a good deterrent,\" said Daniel DeLorenzi, vice president of security and safety services. \"We have three drone detection systems. ... Not only can we track the drone, but more importantly, we can track where the operator is.\"", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The tournament will feature 16 of the best countries North and South America have to offer, including the United States.\n\nThe U.S. Men's National Team hasn't done particularly well in this tournament though. 2024 will be just the fifth time the United States has been invited since guest nations were allowed to join in 1993. In that time, the U.S. has never finished better than fourth (1995, 2016).\n\nOnce again, the States will enter the tournament without much in the way of expectations. While they certainly aren't the worst team to compete in this year's Copa America, they're still a far cry from the favorites Argentina (2021 champions) and Brazil (2019 champions). If there's one thing to know about Copa America though, it's that surprises can happen at any time.\n\nWANNA BET? Check out new customer offers with the best online sportsbooks and sports betting apps\n\nHere's every team competing in the 2024 Copa America ranked by their championship odds. All odds via BetMGM.\n\nCopa America: Argentina begins Copa Ame\u0301rica vs. Canada. How to watch Messi play, best bets, and more\n\nCopa America is the perfect opportunity for Panama to prove its worth as a potential 2026 World Cup qualifier. Still, this is a team that is definitely a step down from others in its group, and their championship odds reflect that.\n\nJamaica's chances lie with the availability of two of their star players: wide forward Leon Bailey and goalkeeper Andre Blake. While both players are listed on the team's roster ahead of the tournament, Bailey has expressed disinterest in playing for the national team and insists he will not be playing in Copa America. Blake, meanwhile, recently underwent meniscus surgery, and is expected to miss considerable time, putting his odds of playing in Copa America in jeopardy.\n\nCosta Rica is not a terrible team. After all, they did have a shot to survive the group stage in the 2022 World Cup, but they have been placed in the daunting Group D alongside Brazil, Colombia, and Paraguay. It would take several upsets for them to even come close to a shot at a championship.\n\nBolivia has failed to record a single point (meaning they haven't even managed a draw) in each of the last three Copa Americas. Bolivia's inexperienced roster and lack of recent success do not bode well for their chances this year either.\n\nThough Venezuela is not the most talented team in their group, let alone the tournament, their team has a lot of experience together and they have performed tremendously well as of late, with nine points through their first six World Cup qualifying matches.\n\nVenezuela has certainly been the beneficiary of a lot of luck though. The team was expected to surrender 7.74 goals during those six matches, but only wound up giving up three. As people say, sometimes it's better to be lucky than good, but lucky eventually runs out and that could very well happen early on during Copa America.\n\nCanada's manager Jesse Marsch is known for playing very quick and intense, which could suit the Canadian team well if Marsch had enough time to implement his gameplan. That's a huge question mark for the national team heading into Copa America. If Marsch had enough time to start making his mark on the team, this Canadian team could make some waves during the group stage. That's still a massive unknown though.\n\nAfter losing a penalty shootout against Australia for the final 2022 World Cup spot, Peru has not won an international match since. Despite their history and supposedly talented roster, they've yet to win a single World Cup qualifying match, losing four and drawing two, all while scoring only one goal throughout all six games. Peru's recent 2-0 loss to Bolivia is arguably the most embarrassing of all though. It's tough to see this team making waves in a group with Argentina, Chile, and Canada.\n\nParaguay has had serious trouble scoring as of late with just one goal in their first six World Cup qualifying matches. However, Paraguay is too talented up front to expect that scoring drought to last much longer. Unfortunately for Paraguay though, they find themselves in the daunting Group D and are not expected to reach the knockout rounds. That puts a real damper on their championship odds.\n\nThis Chile team is nowhere close to the 2015 squad that won Copa America. Still, they are expected to reach the knockout rounds as the second-best team in Group A behind Argentina. The team has had a lot of trouble scoring goals, resulting in just 0.5 goals per match in their first six World Cup qualifying matches.\n\nOn the bright side, they were able to dominate Paraguay 3-0 a week ago, but it's still not the elite win that gives Chilean fans hope for their team to win Copa America.\n\nDespite being ranked seventh in Copa America championship odds, Ecuador has battled tough against very strong opponents as of late. In their three biggest World Cup qualifying matches thus far, Ecuador has lost 1-0 to Argentina, tied Colombia, and beaten Uruguay.\n\nGiven that Ecuador is in arguably the least threatening group of any in this year's Copa America, there's a chance that Ecuador can sneak into the quarterfinals without much trouble, well-rested, and capable of doing some serious damage once the knockout rounds start.\n\nDespite their recent 5-1 loss to Colombia, most people agree that the U.S. played surprisingly well for most of that game until a series of errors caught up to them. This is undoubtedly the most talented team the United States has had in some time with each of their 11 starters playing in amongst Europe's most elite leagues during club season. Christian Pulisic is obviously a tremendous player capable of leading this team far, and given their relatively easy group (should get six points from Bolivia and Panama), they should go far. Still, their path to a championship is tough and will likely force the U.S. to defeat a team like Colombia, Uruguay, or Brazil for any hope of reaching the Finals.\n\nDespite their incredible track record in CONCACAF, the Mexican national team has started to lose in their rivalry against the United States. The U.S. has beaten Mexico in each of their last two meetings by a combined five goals,. Given Mexico's 4-0 loss to Uruguay in June and 3-2 defeat at the hands of Brazil's B team just a few days later, it's safe to assume that Mexico is not at the top of their game currently.\n\nDating back to February 1, 2022, Colombia's national team has not lost a match. They were ousted in the 2021 Copa America semifinals in a penalty shootout, and just barely missed out on qualifying for the 2022 World Cup. Since then though, Colombia is undefeated. And they've been very impressive as well.\n\nSome of their recent wins include a 5-1 thrashing over the United States, a win over Brazil in World Cup qualifying, shut outs over Germany and Spain, and two wins over Mexico. For a team that is currently tied with the U.S.A. and Mexico in Copa America odds, Colombia certainly seems to have their numbers. Their impressive track record and relatively high odds should make Colombia a popular bet.\n\nThroughout the 2020's, Argentina has just two losses: their 2022 World Cup opening round shocker against Saudi Arabia and their loss to Uruguay in November. That alone should tell you just how improved this Uruguay team is since their last trot on the international stage. The team currently sits in second in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying standings, six points ahead of Brazil. They've also beaten Brazil as recently as October.\n\nNeymar's absence for this year's tournament is obviously a huge blow. He was undoubtedly Brazil's best player in the team's 2021 Copa America Finals loss to Argentina. Still, Brazil has an undeniably great roster filled with tons of players who could break out and win the tournament's Golden Boot.\n\nThe drawback to this team though has been their inability to prove themselves. Their results during CONMEBOL 2026 World Cup qualifying were underwhelming to say the least. Brazil failed to win in each of their last four qualifying matches, including three losses to Uruguay, Colombia, and Argentina. They even failed to record a win at full strength in an international friendly against a hobbled United States team a week ago, settling for a 1-1 draw.\n\nBrazil is tremendously talented, but until they can put it all together, they do not deserve to be named Copa America favorites.\n\nThe reigning Copa America champions, Argentina has the luxury of one of the easier group stages in the tournament with Canada, Peru, and Chile. They also boast the most talented roster in this year's tournament, with players like Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez, Cristian Romero, and , of course, Lionel Messi.\n\nGiven Argentina's incredible hot streak in recent years, winning the World Cup in 2022 and recording the best expected goal difference during CONMEBOL 2026 World Cup qualifying, it's hard to argue against Argentina. They have the best odds for good reason and they'll be very difficult to take down.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Prior to that, Argentina reached Copa America finals in 2015 and 2016 and finished third in 2019.\n\nThe tourney includes 10 South American clubs and six from North and Central America and the Caribbean. The 48th edition is hosted by the United States for the second time.\n\nArgentina holds all-time records in Copa America with 34 total medals and 128 wins. Messi is tied for seventh all-time in Copa America with 13 goals, holds the record with 17 assists and Thursday's match will give him the record for matches played in the tournament (35), breaking a tie with Chile's Sergio Livingstone.\n\nThe final is July 11 in Miami Gardens, Fla., and Argentina is favored to be there. Coach Lionel Scaloni's squad features 21 of the 26 players from the World Cup championship two years ago.\n\nScaloni said last week Argentina needs to pause this month to enjoy Messi while he's playing, but Messi is taking nothing for granted.\n\n\"Today, we can say that we are the best because we are the world champions,\" he said. \"But that does not make us believe that we are going to win this Copa America by walking.\"\n\nArgentina is ranked No. 1 in the FIFA World rankings. No. 49 Canada is in its first Copa America and is breaking in new coach Jesse Marsch, the American who last managed Leeds United of the English Premier League. Canada named Marsch to the post on May 13.\n\nAfter Canada lost all three matches in the 2022 World Cup, Marsch is using Copa America as preparation for a better performance in the 2026 World Cup that will be played in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\n\nMarsch said Wednesday he planned no major revisions to the lineup but emphasized the buzzword with the team entering the opener is aggressiveness.\n\nCaptain Alphonso Davies said Canada doesn't need extra motivation to put their best foot forward Thursday night.\n\n\"Our mindset is strong, we're going out there and play against the champions,\" Davis said Wednesday. \"That's the motivation for us.\"\n\nCanada's Copa America squad has just two players over age 30 -- goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau (30) and midfielder Jonathan Osorio (32) -- and fifteen are 25 or younger.\n\n\"I think it's been good for this new group. It's kind of a new era and guys are responding really well,\" Osorio said.\n\nThe youthfulness contrasts with Messi, who turns 37 on Monday but is not slowing down. He has 12 goals in 12 matches for Inter Miami this MLS season.\n\nCanada is next scheduled to play Tuesday against Peru, when Argentina matches up with Chile.

With a long history of success in the tournament, Argentina is a formidable force, while Canada views this competition as preparation for the 2026 World Cup. Messi aims to continue his stellar performance.\n\nDefending champions Argentina, led by Lionel Messi, kick off their Copa America Group A campaign against tournament debutants Canada on Thursday in Atlanta. The Argentines, who won the tournament in 2021 and went on to hoist the 2022 World Cup, are no strangers to Copa America success.\n\nThey reached the finals in 2015 and 2016 and finished third in 2019. This year's tournament brings together 10 South American teams and six from North and Central America and the Caribbean, in the 48th edition of the tournament, hosted for the second time by the United States.\n\nHolding the tournament's all-time record with 34 top-three finishes and 128 match victories, Argentina are a formidable force. Messi, tied for seventh place in the tournament's all-time scoring chart with 13 goals, also holds the record with 17 assists.\n\nOn Thursday he will surpass Chile's Sergio Livingstone record by playing in his 35th Copa America match. Argentina, coached by Lionel Scaloni and featuring 21 players from their World Cup-winning squad, are tipped to make it to the final on July 14 in Miami, Florida.\n\nHowever, Messi insists they will not be complacent. \"Today, we can say that we are the best because we are the world champions. But that does not make us believe that we are going to win this Copa America by walking,\" Messi said.\n\nRanked number one in the FIFA world rankings, Argentina will face 49th-ranked Canada. With newly appointed American coach Jesse Marsch, Canada are using the tournament as preparation for the 2026 World Cup which they will co-host with the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nCanada's Copa America squad features only two players over age 30 -- goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau (30) and midfielder Jonathan Osorio (32) -- and 15 are aged 25 or younger. \"I think it's been good for this new group. It's kind of a new era and guys are responding really well,\" Osorio said.\n\nThe youthfulness contrasts with Messi, who turns 37 on Monday and has shown no signs of slowing down, with 12 goals in 12 matches for Inter Miami in the MLS this season. Canada's next match is against Peru on Tuesday, the same day Argentina face Chile. Both teams will wrap up their group games on June 29 with Canada taking on Chile and Argentina playing Peru.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Livingstone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Livingstone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Scaloni", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Scaloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Osorio", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Osorio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peru"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Peru"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/14_06_2024_10_08_41_06306.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658543", "eventUri": "eng-9658543", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-14", "textStart": 1381, "textEnd": 1388}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-29", "textStart": 2484, "textEnd": 2491}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Neymar will be absent for 2021 runners-up Brazil, though Vinicius Jr. will hope to have a breakout international tournament as he continues to flourish for Real Madrid.\n\nFor the U.S. men's national team, Christian Pulisic and Co. will seek a deep run to prove they belong against some of the top nations, while Mexico desperately needs to find some form.\n\nFrom how to watch to teams and players to watch for, here's everything to know for the Copa America 2024:\n\nWhat is the Copa America tournament?\n\nThe Copa America tournament is similar to the World Cup except it only involves teams in North and South America and the Caribbean. Teams compete in four-nation groups and play each other round-robin style.\n\nThe top two sides from each group will advance to the knockout stages. From there, each game is single elimination until a winner is crowned in the final.\n\nWhen is the Copa America tournament?\n\nThe 2024 tournament will begin on Thursday, June 20 and run until the final on Sunday, July 14.\n\nArgentina vs. Canada on Thursday at 8 p.m. ET, 5 p.m. PT is the tournament opener.\n\nWhere is the Copa America tournament?\n\nThe United States is the host country for the entire tournament. The final will be held in Miami, Fla.\n\nHow to watch, stream the Copa America tournament\n\nThe 2024 tournament will be available to watch and stream in English on FOX Sports (FOX, FS1, FS2) while Univision and TUDN will broadcast and stream games in Spanish.\n\nWhat are the 2024 Copa America groups?\n\nThere's not a specific \"Group of Death\" in the 2024 Copa America due to the overall quality, but Group D may be the most intriguing. Here's a look at all four groups:\n\nArgentina and Brazil should be the clear-cut favorites to win the tournament based on roster strength.\n\nLed by Messi, Argentina's squad is essentially similar to the team that won the 2022 World Cup. Lionel Scaloni is still the manager, with Julian Alvarez, Exequiel Palacio and Christian Romero establishing themselves more at the club level since the Qatar triumph.\n\nBrazil, now managed by Dorival Junior, also brought a squad quite similar to the Qatar World Cup. Some key names not involved are Neymar, Gabriel Jesus, Casemiro and Richarlison, while Endrick, Gabriel Martinelli, Savio and Ederson are potential breakout candidates.\n\nWho are the underdog teams in the 2024 Copa America?\n\nIf it's not Argentina or Brazil, then Uruguay and Colombia could be the primary underdogs.\n\nUruguay doesn't have a standout goalie, but Federico Valverde, Luis Suarez, Darwin Nunez, Ronald Araujo, Jose Maria Gimenez, Manuel Ugarte and Rodrigo Bentancur are more than enough to potentially topple the few bigger teams.\n\nColombia has veteran David Ospina between the sticks, but Luis Diaz, Jhon Duran, Daniel Munoz, Jefferson Lerma, Luis Sinisterra and Davinson Sanchez could play spoiler if it all pans out.\n\nFringe underdog teams include the USMNT, Mexico and Ecuador, but each have its flaws.\n\nThe U.S. under Gregg Berhalter has struggled to upset bigger teams, Mexico is still in a turbulent phase and Ecuador has a promising defensive structure but it lacks game changers in attack.", "source": {"uri": "necn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NECN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sanjesh_singh@necn.com", "name": "Sanjesh Singh", "type": "author",

Another Copa Ame\u0301rica title for Argentina will continue Messi's dominance atop the sport.\n\n\"Winning again is increasingly difficult, but we are going to try again,\" Messi said after scoring two goals with an assist in Argentina's 4-1 friendly win over Guatemala last Friday.\n\nMessi, the star of Inter Miami in Major League Soccer, turns 37 on June 24. He's still among the best players in the world, despite nearing the end of his illustrious career. And his participation in Copa Ame\u0301rica is a critical moment for the sport in the United States, which will host the FIFA Club World Cup in 2025 and World Cup 2026.\n\nHere's everything you need to know before the match:\n\nArgentina and Canada will kickoff at 8 p.m. ET, 9 p.m. in Argentina.\n\nArgentina vs. Canada will broadcast on FS1 and FS2 (in English) or TUDN and Univision (in Spanish).\n\nYes.

The over/under on goals scored is set at 2.5, according to BETMGM.\n\nMessi has -125 anytime goalscorer odds, and +400 to score two or more goals against Canada. Messi also has +275 odds to score first and his team to win.\n\nArgentina has played in three of the last four Copa Ame\u0301rica finals, losing to Chile in 2015 and 2016, finishing third in 2019, before winning in 2021.\n\nMessi fans and Argentinians agonized the losses -- none worse than the Copa Ame\u0301rica Centenario final in 2016 where he missed a penalty and abruptly retired from the national team.\n\nDating back to Argentina's loss to eventual champion Brazil in the 2019 Copa Ame\u0301rica, Argentina has lost just three times in their last 48 matches together.\n\nMessi is healthy. He played every minute in Argentina's friendly against Guatemala last Friday. His last major match was against MLS club St. Louis City, where he scored a goal in a 3-3 draw. His last injury was a hamstring strain about 2 \u00bd months ago.\n\nMessi has played in 29 of 43 possible matches with Inter Miami since last July - missing 14 games due to rest or injury. He has 25 goals with 16 assists with the club, including five assists in a match on May 4.\n\nMessi recently had a goal and an assist in six games, including a four-game stretch from April 13-May 4 - where he scored six goals with eight assists.\n\nWhen healthy, Messi has been effective and his teams are often victorious.\n\nArgentina (+175) is the betting favorite to win Copa Ame\u0301rica, while the United States is tied among three teams with the fourth-best odds to win, according to BETMGM. Brazil (+225) and Uruguay (+500) are next in line, followed by Colombia, Mexico and the U.S. men's national team (+1200).\n\nArgentina (-400) and Canada (+550) are the favorites to advance in Group A, ahead of Chile and Peru (both +1100).\n\nAfter the Copa Ame\u0301rica opener, Argentina continues group play against Chile and Peru.\n\n\u220eJune 25: Argentina vs. Chile, 9 p.m. ET, MetLife Stadium

play a quarterfinal matchup in Houston or Arlington, Texas.\n\n\u220eJuly 9: If Argentina reaches the semifinal, it would play at MetLife Stadium again.\n\n\u220eJuly 13: Copa Am\u00e9rica third-place

Story of 2021 CONMEBOL tournament final between Brazil and Messi's Argentina", "body": "The Copa America is here and, with 16 teams taking part in this year's tournament, there are several big-hitters from North, Central and South America aiming for ultimate continental glory.\n\nOf course, the defending Copa America winners, World Cup champions, world's No. 1-ranked team, and current leaders in the CONMEBOL World Cup Qualifying table, Argentina, are the favorites to retain their crown, with Brazil right behind.\n\nLionel Messi won his first senior international trophy when Argentina lifted the 2021 Copa America, defeating arch-rivals Brazil at the Maracana.\n\nAs La Albiceleste go in search for their 16th title to overtake rivals Uruguay and become the most successful team in the competition's history, The Sporting News takes a ride back in time to the happenings of the last Copa America final.\n\nMORE: Copa America bracket, full schedule of matches and latest results, updated LIVE\n\nLionel Messi's Argentina got their hands on the prestigious Copa America trophy for a record-equaling 15th time. Held in Brazil, and with crowds absent due to COVID-19, Argentina battled their way to the final and beat the hosts 1-0 in the showpiece match at the Maracana on July 10, 2021.\n\nThat triumph marked La Albiceleste's first South American Championship title in nearly three decades, and was legendary attacker Messi's first piece of major international silverware.\n\nFast forward three years to 2024 and not only does Argentina head into the latest Copa America as the defending champions, they are also the World Cup holders, having won world football's greatest prize in Qatar in 2022.\n\nMORE: FIFA Ranking for all Copa America sides\n\nArgentina won their first major title in 28 years as Angel Di Mar\u00eda's 22nd-minute strike gave them a 1-0 victory over Brazil. The final, held at the iconic Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, was a dramatic showdown between two of South America's footballing giants, although it was played in a near-empty stadium due to health protocols as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nArgentina's victory was a particular triumph for then-Barcelona striker Lionel Messi, who picked up his first international trophy in a blue-and-white shirt after more than a decade of club and individual honors.\n\nDi Maria, who started for just the second time in the Copa, scored the only goal of the game midway through the first half, lobbing the stranded Brazil goalkeeper Ederson with aplomb after a long ball from Rodrigo De Paul.\n\nBrazil piled on the pressure in fits and starts, but they just could not get an equalizer against the robust Argentina backline. The match was a hard-fought, scrappy one, with Argentina the better side in a cagey affair that featured 41 fouls and nine yellow cards.\n\nMORE: Copa America winners, who has won the trophy before?\n\nCopa America 2021 was held in Brazil, who stepped in as the host country on short notice, after Argentina and Colombia, the original co-hosts, were unable to stage the tournament due to COVID-19 concerns and political protests, respectively.\n\nThe tournament was played across four locations in Brazil and featured 28 matches, with closer venues and reduced travel time meaning additional rest days between the group stage and quarterfinals.\n\nThe host cities were Rio de Janeiro (Maracana and Nilton Santos Stadiums), Brasi\u00adlia (Mane Garrincha Stadium), Goiania (Olimpico) and Cuiaba (Pantanal Arena).\n\nThe opening game was held at the Mane Garrincha Stadium in Brasilia as hosts Brazil faced Venezuela, while the final was played at the legendary Maracana Stadium on July 10, 2021.\n\nMORE: What Copa America matches are on today?\n\nOriginally scheduled for 2020, the tournament had to be postponed to 2021, with the 47th edition of Copa America delayed primarily due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, which caused unprecedented disruptions to sporting events worldwide.\n\nThe decision was part of a broader move by football governing bodies to reschedule major tournaments, including the UEFA European Championship, which was similarly deferred to 2021 to ensure the safety of players, staff and fans.\n\nAdditionally, the tournament faced logistical issues due to the evolving spread of the virus. Argentina and Colombia were initially set to co-host the event, but both countries faced significant obstacles.\n\nArgentina saw a drastic rise in COVID-19 cases, making it impossible to host the matches safely. Meanwhile, Colombia were dealing with widespread civil unrest and protests, further complicating the situation.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"},

Be sure to vote for your favorite Super Bowl ad with Ad Meter! Go to admeter.usatoday.com.\n\nLionel Messi and Argentina hope to continue their reign as soccer's world champions during Copa Ame\u0301rica 2024.\n\nMessi and Argentina take center stage in the Copa Ame\u0301rica 2024 opener, facing Canada at Mercedes-Benz Stadium on Thursday night.\n\nArgentina's 2021 Copa Ame\u0301rica win was the precursor to Messi's crowning achievement at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, etching his place in soccer lore as we know it. Another Copa Ame\u0301rica title for Argentina will continue Messi's dominance atop the sport.\n\n\"Winning again is increasingly difficult, but we are going to try again,\" Messi said after scoring two goals with an assist in Argentina's 4-1 friendly win over Guatemala last Friday.\n\nMessi, the star of Inter Miami in Major League Soccer, turns 37 on June 24. He's still among the best players in the world, despite nearing the end of his illustrious career. And his participation in Copa Ame\u0301rica is a critical moment for the sport in the United States, which will host the FIFA Club World Cup in 2025 and World Cup 2026.\n\nHere's everything you need to know before the match:\n\nArgentina and Canada will kickoff at 8 p.m. ET, 9 p.m. in Argentina.\n\nArgentina vs. Canada will broadcast on FS1 and FS2 (in English) or TUDN and Univision (in Spanish).\n\nYes. Messi is expected to start and play in Argentina's Copa Ame\u0301rica run this summer, beginning with the Canada match.\n\nArgentina is a -300 favorite to win, while Canada has +875 odds to pull off the upset and a draw is +425 odds. The over/under on goals scored is set at 2.5, according to BETMGM.\n\nMessi has -125 anytime goalscorer odds, and +400 to score two or more goals against Canada. Messi also has +275 odds to score first and his team to win.\n\nArgentina has played in three of the last four Copa Ame\u0301rica finals, losing to Chile in 2015 and 2016, finishing third in 2019, before winning in 2021.\n\nMessi fans and Argentinians agonized the losses -- none worse than the Copa Ame\u0301rica Centenario final in 2016 where he missed a penalty and abruptly retired from the national team.\n\nDating back to Argentina's loss to eventual champion Brazil in the 2019 Copa Ame\u0301rica, Argentina has lost just three times in their last 48 matches together.\n\nMessi is healthy. He played every minute in Argentina's friendly against Guatemala last Friday. His last major match was against MLS club St. Louis City, where he scored a goal in a 3-3 draw. His last injury was a hamstring strain about 2 \u00bd months ago.\n\nMessi has played in 29 of 43 possible matches with Inter Miami since last July - missing 14 games due to rest or injury. He has 25 goals with 16 assists with the club, including five assists in a match on May 4.\n\nMessi recently had a goal and an assist in six games, including a four-game stretch from April 13-May 4 - where he scored six goals with eight assists.\n\nWhen healthy, Messi has been effective and his teams are often victorious.\n\nArgentina (+175) is the betting favorite to win Copa Ame\u0301rica, while the United States is tied among three teams with the fourth-best odds to win, according to BETMGM. Brazil (+225) and Uruguay (+500) are next in line, followed by Colombia, Mexico and the U.S. men's national team (+1200).\n\nArgentina (-400) and Canada (+550) are the favorites to advance in Group A, ahead of Chile and Peru (both +1100).\n\nAfter the Copa Ame\u0301rica opener, Argentina continues group play against Chile and Peru.\n\n\u220eJune 25: Argentina vs. Chile, 9 p.m. ET, MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey,\n\n\u220eJune 29: Argentina vs. Peru, 8 p.m., Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.\n\n\u220eJuly 4 or 5: If Argentina advances out of the group stage, it will play a quarterfinal matchup in Houston or Arlington, Texas.\n\n\u220eJuly 9: If Argentina reaches the semifinal, it would play at MetLife Stadium again.\n\n\u220eJuly 13: Copa Am\u00e9rica third-place game at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte.\n\n\u220eJuly 14: Copa Am\u00e9rica final will be held at Hard Rock Stadium.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA

The tournament will feature 16 of the best countries North and South America have to offer, including the United States.\n\nThe U.S. Men's National Team hasn't done particularly well in this tournament though. 2024 will be just the fifth time the United States has been invited since guest nations were allowed to join in 1993. In that time, the U.S. has never finished better than fourth (1995, 2016).\n\nOnce again, the States will enter the tournament without much in the way of expectations. While they certainly aren't the worst team to compete in this year's Copa America, they're still a far cry from the favorites Argentina (2021 champions) and Brazil (2019 champions). If there's one thing to know about Copa America though, it's that surprises can happen at any time.\n\nWANNA BET? Check out new customer offers with the best online sportsbooks and sports betting apps\n\nHere's every team competing in the 2024 Copa America ranked by their championship odds. All odds via BetMGM.\n\nCopa America: Argentina begins Copa Ame\u0301rica vs. Canada. How to watch Messi play, best bets, and more\n\nCopa America is the perfect opportunity for Panama to prove its worth as a potential 2026 World Cup qualifier. Still, this is a team that is definitely a step down from others in its group, and their championship odds reflect that.\n\n15) Jamaica, +20000\n\nJamaica's chances lie with the availability of two of their star players: wide forward Leon Bailey and goalkeeper Andre Blake. While both players are listed on the team's roster ahead of the tournament, Bailey has expressed disinterest in playing for the national team and insists he will not be playing in Copa America. Blake, meanwhile, recently underwent meniscus surgery, and is expected to miss considerable time, putting his odds of playing in Copa America in jeopardy.\n\n14) Costa Rica, +15000\n\nCosta Rica is not a terrible team. After all, they did have a shot to survive the group stage in the 2022 World Cup, but they have been placed in the daunting Group D alongside Brazil, Colombia, and Paraguay. It would take several upsets for them to even come close to a shot at a championship.\n\n13) Bolivia, +12500\n\nBolivia has failed to record a single point (meaning they haven't even managed a draw) in each of the last three Copa Americas. Bolivia's inexperienced roster and lack of recent success do not bode well for their chances this year either.\n\n12) Venezuela, +10000\n\nThough Venezuela is not the most talented team in their group, let alone the tournament, their team has a lot of experience together and they have performed tremendously well as of late, with nine points through their first six World Cup qualifying matches.\n\nVenezuela has certainly been the beneficiary of a lot of luck though. The team was expected to surrender 7.74 goals during those six matches, but only wound up giving up three. As people say, sometimes it's better to be lucky than good, but lucky eventually runs out and that could very well happen early on during Copa America.\n\n11) Canada, +8000\n\nCanada's manager Jesse Marsch is known for playing very quick and intense, which could suit the Canadian team well if Marsch had enough time to implement his gameplan. That's a huge question mark for the national team heading into Copa America. If Marsch had enough time to start making his mark on the team, this Canadian team could make some waves during the group stage. That's still a massive unknown though.\n\nT-9) Peru, +6600\n\nAfter losing a penalty shootout against Australia for the final 2022 World Cup spot, Peru has not won an international match since. Despite their history and supposedly talented roster, they've yet to win a single World Cup qualifying match, losing four and drawing two, all while scoring only one goal throughout all six games. Peru's recent 2-0 loss to Bolivia is arguably the most embarrassing of all though. It's tough to see this team making waves in a group with Argentina, Chile, and Canada.\n\nT-9) Paraguay, +6600\n\nParaguay has had serious trouble scoring as of late with just one goal in their first six World Cup qualifying matches. However, Paraguay is too talented up front to expect that scoring drought to last much longer. Unfortunately for Paraguay though, they find themselves in the daunting Group D and are not expected to reach the knockout rounds. That puts a real damper on their championship odds.\n\n8) Chile, +3300\n\nThis Chile team is nowhere close to the 2015 squad that won Copa America. Still, they are expected to reach the knockout rounds as the second-best team in Group A behind Argentina. The team has had a lot of trouble scoring goals, resulting in just 0.5 goals per match in their first six World Cup qualifying matches.\n\nOn the bright side, they were able to dominate Paraguay 3-0 a week ago, but it's still not the elite win that gives Chilean fans hope for their team to win Copa America.\n\n7) Ecuador, +1600\n\nDespite being ranked seventh in Copa America championship odds, Ecuador has battled tough against very strong opponents as of late. In their three biggest World Cup qualifying matches thus far, Ecuador has lost 1-0 to Argentina, tied Colombia, and beaten Uruguay.\n\nGiven that Ecuador is in arguably the least threatening group of any in this year's Copa America, there's a chance that Ecuador can sneak into the quarterfinals without much trouble, well-rested, and capable of doing some serious damage once the knockout rounds start.\n\nT-4) United States, +1200\n\nDespite their recent 5-1 loss to Colombia, most people agree that the U.S. played surprisingly well for most of that game until a series of errors caught up to them. This is undoubtedly the most talented team the United States has had in some time with each of their 11 starters playing in amongst Europe's most elite leagues during club season. Christian Pulisic is obviously a tremendous player capable of leading this team far, and given their relatively easy group (should get six points from Bolivia and Panama), they should go far. Still, their path to a championship is tough and will likely force the U.S. to defeat a team like Colombia, Uruguay, or Brazil for any hope of reaching the Finals.\n\nT-4) Mexico, +1200\n\nDespite their incredible track record in CONCACAF, the Mexican national team has started to lose in their rivalry against the United States. The U.S. has beaten Mexico in each of their last two meetings by a combined five goals,. Given Mexico's 4-0 loss to Uruguay in June and 3-2 defeat at the hands of Brazil's B team just a few days later, it's safe to assume that Mexico is not at the top of their game currently.\n\nT-4) Colombia, +1200\n\nDating back to February 1, 2022, Colombia's national team has not lost a match. They were ousted in the 2021 Copa America semifinals in a penalty shootout, and just barely missed out on qualifying for the 2022 World Cup. Since then though, Colombia is undefeated. And they've been very impressive as well.\n\nSome of their recent wins include a 5-1 thrashing over the United States, a win over Brazil in World Cup qualifying, shut outs over Germany and Spain, and two wins over Mexico. For a team that is currently tied with the U.S.A. and Mexico in Copa America odds, Colombia certainly seems to have their numbers. Their impressive track record and relatively high odds should make Colombia a popular bet.\n\n3) Uruguay, +500\n\nThroughout the 2020's, Argentina has just two losses: their 2022 World Cup opening round shocker against Saudi Arabia and their loss to Uruguay in November. That alone should tell you just how improved this Uruguay team is since their last trot on the international stage. The team currently sits in second in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying standings, six points ahead of Brazil. They've also beaten Brazil as recently as October.\n\n2) Brazil, +225\n\nNeymar's absence for this year's tournament is obviously a huge blow. He was undoubtedly Brazil's best player in the team's 2021 Copa America Finals loss to Argentina. Still, Brazil has an undeniably great roster filled with tons of players who could break out and win the tournament's Golden Boot.\n\nThe drawback to this team though has been their inability to prove themselves. Their results during CONMEBOL 2026 World Cup qualifying were underwhelming to say the least. Brazil failed to win in each of their last four qualifying matches, including three losses to Uruguay, Colombia, and Argentina. They even failed to record a win at full strength in an international friendly against a hobbled United States team a week ago, settling for a 1-1 draw.\n\nBrazil is tremendously talented, but until they can put it all together, they do not deserve to be named Copa America favorites.\n\n1) Argentina, +175\n\nThe reigning Copa America champions, Argentina has the luxury of one of the easier group stages in the tournament with Canada, Peru, and Chile. They also boast the most talented roster in this year's tournament, with players like Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez, Cristian Romero, and , of course, Lionel Messi.\n\nGiven Argentina's incredible hot streak in recent years, winning the World Cup in 2022 and recording the best expected goal difference during CONMEBOL 2026 World Cup qualifying, it's hard to argue against Argentina. They have the best odds for good reason and they'll be very difficult to take down.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

For me, more complicated than a World Cup,\" the French national team captain said at a news conference before his team's first game.\n\nHold my beer, said former club teammate Lionel Messi, who led Argentina past France in an epic 2022 World Cup final, in which he and Mbappe -- who broke his nose in France's Euro-opening win over Austria on Monday -- combined for five of the game's six goals.\n\nSure the Euros, the quadrennial championship for FIFA's 55-member European confederation, is difficult. However, don't sleep on Copa Am\u00e9rica, the South American tournament expanded this year to include the U.S., Mexico and four other teams.\n\nRead more:How an amputee soccer team is helping Ukrainian soldiers overcome the trauma of war\n\n\"Well, everybody prioritizes their tournament,\" Messi fired back in a TV interview ahead of the Copa Am\u00e9rica opener Thursday between Argentina and Canada. \"The Euros is very important and has the best teams, but he's leaving out three-time champion Argentina, five-time champion Brazil, two-time champion Uruguay.\n\n\"There are a lot of world champions left off to say that it's the most difficult tournament.\"\n\nNot just world champions. In top-ranked Argentina and No. 5 Brazil, the Copa Am\u00e9rica field also has two of the top five teams in the latest FIFA world rankings. Colombia, which is also in the 16-team field, hasn't lost in 23 games over more than two years, the longest unbeaten streak in international soccer.\n\nA third of the 24 teams in the top-heavy Euro field are ranked outside the top 32.\n\nWith that as an introduction, here are four things to watch when the 48th Copa Am\u00e9rica kicks off at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta:\n\nIt's a World Cup dress rehearsal\n\nThe South American championship is being played in the U.S. for the second time in eight years and eight of the 14 venues, including Inglewood's SoFi Stadium, also will play host to games in the 2026 World Cup. That makes the tournament an important trial run.\n\n\"We will always look at every event as a test for the next things that's coming up,\" said Otto Benedict, senior vice president for facility and campus operations at SoFi Stadium. \"Copa will allow us to have an international fan base that's coming through the building, so we're going to understand how those guests come, how they perceive the building.\"\n\nRead more:Emma Hayes won't let her USWNT coaching dream turn into a nightmare\n\nSoFi, which will stage eight games in the World Cup, will host two Copa group-stage matches: Brazil's tournament opener with Costa Rica on June 24 and Mexico's second game, with Venezuela, on June 26.\n\nBenedict said the stadium's Matrix Turf surface will be covered with a carpet of natural grass, a procedure that will be repeated for the World Cup, but the retractable bleachers in the corners will remain in place, leaving the pitch slightly narrower than FIFA will require for the World Cup.\n\n\"We're still going to have opportunities to learn,\" Benedict said. \"All those things are data points that will be collected.\"\n\nThe seven other Copa stadiums staging World Cup matches will conduct similar trials.\n\nCopa Am\u00e9rica will be a World Cup test for the USMNT as well\n\nThe 2026 World Cup will be a defining moment for the U.S., and the Copa might give an indication how the national team will be defined.\n\nIs the U.S. one of the world's top soccer-playing nations, as U.S. Soccer would like you to believe, or is it a pretender, a team that struggles against top competition and is undeserving of being ranked 11th -- ahead of Colombia, Germany and Uruguay -- in the latest FIFA rankings?\n\nAs a World Cup host, the U.S. -- along with co-hosts Mexico and Canada -- will not have to go through qualifying for 2026, making Copa the most challenging tournament it will face in the next two years.\n\nThe roster coach Gregg Berhalter will take into the team's opener against Bolivia at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on Saturday is collectively the best in USMNT history, with 23 of 26 players coming off major European clubs. Copa provides an important international stage on which to display those talents.\n\n\"It's a chance for us to show, before the World Cup, that we're a team to be feared,\" defender Chris Richards told reporters.\n\nIs Gregg Berhalter up to the task?\n\nNo U.S. manager who has coached more than seven games has a better winning percentage than Berhalter, but given the quality of the roster and the team's recent struggles -- the U.S. has won only two of its last six games -- he has come under fire. The protests grew louder after an especially poor showing in a 5-1 loss to Colombia earlier this month.\n\nThe Copa group stage, in which the U.S. will play Bolivia, Panama and Uruguay, offers a chance to flip that script. The three teams will present vastly different challenges, giving Berhalter a chance to show off his coaching chops with three different game plans.\n\nGetting out of group play is the bare minimum for the U.S., but matters will get a little tougher if it advances and probably will face either Colombia or Brazil in the quarterfinals.\n\nWhat about the rest of the field?\n\nArgentina, the reigning World Cup champion and ranked No. 1 in the world, has lost only two of its last 57 games and has made the Copa Am\u00e9rica final a record 29 times, winning 15.\n\nAlthough the team led by the 36-year-old Messi has aged -- 11 players over 30 and the third-oldest roster in the tournament -- it appears to have a fairly comfortable path to a 30th final at Hard Rock Stadium in suburban Miami on July 14.\n\nWith Colombia and Brazil, Group D could be the toughest of the four four-team groups. Brazil, still without injured Neymar, needs to improve play after losing its last three games -- albeit to Uruguay, Colombia and Argentina -- in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying.\n\nEcuador, whose only losses in 14 games came to Argentina and Italy, could be a dark horse.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"},

48th Copa America", "body": "World champions Argentina get an expanded Copa America under way on Friday morning with Lionel Messi looking to add a second continental title in what is almost certainly his final appearance in the tournament.\n\nThe 108-year-old competition is being held in the United States with the host nation among six teams from the CONCACAF region joining the 10 South American nations looking for a place in the July 14 final in Miami.\n\nWhether this is Messi's goodbye to elite international football remains to be seen, but what is certain is that the eight-times Ballon d'Or winner would relish the chance to win a third straight major tournament with his country, having won the last Copa America in 2021 which featured 10 teams and the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\"It's great to have records and continue to achieve things but I won't take part in a World Cup just to say I've done six,\" Messi told ESPN last week.\n\nAfter facing Canada, Argentina have Chile and Peru to deal with, but they know that tough opposition awaits in the knock-out stage with rivals Brazil and Uruguay the two expected challengers for the title.\n\nBrazil have struggled in CONMEBOL qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup having won just two of their opening six games and they currently sit in sixth place in the standings having lost to Uruguay, Colombia and Argentina.\n\nThere are several familiar names missing from Dorival Junior's Brazil squad with Casemiro, Gabriel Jesus and Thiago Silva left out while Richarlison and Neymar are both missing due to injury.\n\nThe pressure will be on the Real Madrid attacking pair of Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo to translate their club form into success for the Selecao while there is much excitement around the senior tournament debut of 17-year-old talent Endrick, who is set to join Real next month from Palmeiras.\n\nMeanwhile, Uruguay, also 15-times winners, have impressed under their 68-year-old Argentina coach Marcelo Bielsa, who has brought his trademark high-energy style to the team and raised expectations with recent wins over Argentina and Brazil.\n\nColombia head into the tournament without a loss in over two years and with Liverpool's livewire winger Luis Diaz a constant threat and James Rodriguez enjoying a late career revival, Nestor Lorenzo's team can't be discounted.\n\nThe USA will hope that they can generate some sorely needed excitement after losing their way since a creditable run to the last-16 at the World Cup.\n\nMexico have guested frequently in the Copa in the past and reached the final in 1993 and 2001, but they look well below their usual level although they can, as always, count on huge support in the USA.\n\nWhile FIFA will be looking closely at the organization of the event, two years out from the World Cup which will be co-hosted by the USA, Canada and Mexico, the tournament's rich history and prestige means it is much, much more than a 'trial event'.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nCopa is the oldest active international football tournament, having started in 1916, with Uruguay winning the first edition of the tournament.\n\nArgentina and Uruguay are the most successful teams in the Copa America, with 15 titles each while Brazil, another South American giant and the most successful team in the FIFA World Cup (with five titles) is second with nine titles.\n\nThe Copa Am\u00e9rica which was held in the United States in 2016 to celebrate 100 years of the tournament, was the first edition of the competition that took place outside the South American territory and had featured 16 teams.\n\nThe 48th edition of the tournament will be held in 14 cities across the United States, with each location hosting 2 or 3 games.", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType": "news",

Emotional scenes expected in 2024 Copa America", "body": "Messi-mania is at an all-time high as the great man looks to have another major trophy in the bag. The 2024 Copa America starts early Friday morning with defending champions Argentina taking on Canada at Atlanta in the United States of America.\n\nIn all likelihood, this is going to be Messi's last international tournament. The next major tournament is going to be the World Cup in 2026 and the forward, who is going to turn 37 next week, can't sure have enough legs to last another two years, can he? Football is a demanding game after all, not just mentally, but also physically.\n\nThat's why the 2024 Copa America becomes such an important spectacle for fans all over the world. Last time when the tournament happened in 2021, things were starkly different for the Argentine superstar. He had not had any major international trophy to speak of and fans and experts alike were questioning his greatness. He appeared to have fallen behind Cristiano Ronaldo - winner of Euro 2016 with Portugal -- in the GOAT debate too.\n\nThree years on... a lot has happened. Feels like Providence had a hand as Messi not only won the Copa America in 2021 but the very next year he also won the biggest trophy on the planet. Yes, the World Cup in Qatar. Mind you, he wasn't just a participant. He actually played a very important role in the South American nation's success in those two tournaments. The GOAT debate was swiftly thrown out the window.\n\nMessi is heading into the 2024 edition as an ultra-achiever. There is nothing to prove. World Cup winner, Copa America winner, one of highest goal-scorers in the history of international football and highly decorated footballer at club level... he has seen and done it all.\n\nBut if it's going to his last international tournament, we have seen him enough in action to know that he is going to do his damnedest to win another trophy. In the months before the 2021 Copa America, he was visibly on the decline, didn't look as potent as before. The way he has resurrected himself since says a lot about what kind of person he is, and his mentality.\n\nBelieve it or not, there is a strong possibility that if Argentina can defend their Copa title successfully, he may continue and eventually feature in the US-Canada-Mexico event in 2026.\n\nHis strategy is very clear. He is taking one tournament at a time. If he can be resourceful on the pitch benefiting his team in a desired way, why should he call it quits?! This argument perfectly makes sense.\n\nMessi could have left after the 2022 World Cup win. There couldn't have been a better time. But the fact he didn't suggests his hunger for trophies was not satiated after all. So, there is a very strong possibility that Messi continues to play for Argentina even after the Copa. Besides, he has not said anything concrete about whether the Copa will be his last appearance.\n\nWe will know that soon enough. For now, we should treat the Copa America as if it's Messi's last appearance. The European Championship - Copa's equivalent -- is also going on at present and whenever these two tournaments coincide, the Euros manages to get more eyeballs, for, from a holistic point of view, much better teams and players are on view over there.\n\nBut thanks to the uncertainty surrounding him, there will be plenty of focus on the tournament this time around. The 2024 Copa America is going to be an emotional ride for his fans, to be sure. In the absence of Neymar of Brazil owing to injury, Messi is carrying the flag for both the North and South continents now.\n\nWhen all is said and done, whatever may be the outcome of the tournament and whether or not Messi decides to continue, his place in history as one of the greatest footballers is already sealed.

Chile again prevailed against Messi, as he missed his spot-kick in the penalty shootout and Jorge Sampaoli's side held their nerve.\n\nMessi was far more prolific in that tournament, with five goals from his six matches, but so heartbroken was he after a second successive final defeat that Argentina's talisman opted to initially retire from international football after the game.\n\nThree years later, however, he was back. He scored once in 2019 and then four times in 2021, when he was finally able to get his first title in the competition. That was the precursor to his first-ever World Cup title 12 months later in Qatar.\n\nCuriously, his only Copa America in which he did not score was the only one he played at home: in Argentina in 2011.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Sampaoli", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jorge Sampaoli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica_Centenario", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Petanque", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Petanque", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2021-11/lionel-messi-argentina-nigeria-world-cup-russi-2018-26062018_118t4k5tj7m031rdbtmimtq3y9.jpg?itok=1OVbmIl7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658543", "eventUri": "eng-9658543", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Prior to the tournament, Argentina, Canada, Chile, and Peru were sorted into Group A, and Canada have the unlucky pleasure of playing the 2021 winners in their first ever Copa America match.\n\nCanada's lack of experience in the tournament is the complete opposite to Argentina's Copa America dominance. Lionel Messi just lifted Argentina's 15th Copa America title two years ago, and will look to lead his team to a strong start against Jesse Marsch's squad in La Albiceleste's campaign to go back-to-back.\n\nHere's 90min's guide to Argentina vs Canada tomorrow.\n\nArgentina are coming into this summer's Copa America after winning both of their tournament tune-ups in fairly convincing fashion, extending their unbeaten run to five matches.\n\nEnzo Fernandez and Lisandro Mart\u00ednez have recovered from their respective injuries and are fully fit for the competition, giving Lionel Scaloni some decisions to make in the midfield and on the backline. Inserting Mart\u00ednez into the starting XI will break-up the World Cup winning-center-back duo of Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi and Cristian Romero.\n\nMeanwhile, Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez will look to cement himself as Argentina's undisputed No. 9 this summer after Lautaro Mart\u00ednez's string of impressive performances.\n\nArgentina predicted lineup vs Canada (4-3-3): E. Mart\u00ednez; Molina, Romero, Otamendi, Tagliafico; De Paul, Paredes, Mac Allister; Messi, Alvarez, Di Maria\n\nCalling Canada the underdogs of Group A is an understatement. Jesse Marsch has only been in charge for a month, and the manager has yet to secure his first win. Canada also did not score in their two recent international friendlies ahead of Copa America 2024.\n\nStill, they have flashes of immense talent on the pitch, including Bayern Munich's Alphonso Davies and Lille's Jonathan David. Even if Canada manage to steal a point from the reigning Copa America and World Cup champions, it will be considered an upset.\n\nCanada predicted lineup vs Argentina (4-4-2): Crepeau; Johnston, Bombito, Cornelius, Davies; Buchanan, Eustaquio, Kone, Millar; David, Larin\n\nAs good as Alphonso Davies is, he is not enough to get Canada on the winning side of a match with Argentina. La Albiceleste is coming off a 4-1 victory over Guatemala without even playing their true starting XI; Argentina should make easy work of the first-time Copa America participants with the entire world

But that does not make us believe that we are going to win this Copa America by walking,\" Messi said.\n\nRanked number one in the FIFA world rankings, Argentina will face 49th-ranked Canada.\n\nWith newly appointed American coach Jesse Marsch, Canada are using the tournament as preparation for the 2026 World Cup which they will co-host with the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nCanada's Copa America squad features only two players over age 30 -- goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau (30) and midfielder Jonathan Osorio (32) -- and 15 are aged 25 or younger.\n\n\"I think it's been good for this new group. It's kind of a new era and guys are responding really well,\" Osorio said.\n\nThe youthfulness contrasts with Messi, who turns 37 on Monday and has shown no signs of slowing down, with 12 goals in 12 matches for Inter Miami in the MLS this season.\n\nCanada's next match is against Peru on Tuesday, the same day Argentina face Chile. Both teams will wrap up their group games on June 29 with Canada taking on Chile and Argentina playing Peru.

Lionel Messi knows it is.", "body": "By Kevin Baxter, Los Angeles Times The Tribune Content Agency\n\nLOS ANGELES - Kylian Mbappe clearly ruffled some feathers last week when he suggested the European Championship was the world's most difficult international soccer competition.\n\n\"The Euros are complicated. For me, more complicated than a World Cup,\" the French national team captain said at a news conference before his team's first game.\n\nHold my beer, said former club teammate Lionel Messi, who led Argentina past France in an epic 2022 World Cup final, in which he and Mbappe - who broke his nose in France's Euro-opening win over Austria on Monday - combined for five of the game's six goals.\n\nSure the Euros, the quadrennial championship for FIFA's 55-member European confederation, is difficult. However, don't sleep on Copa Am\u00e9rica, the South American tournament expanded this year to include the U.S., Mexico and four other teams.\n\n\"Well, everybody prioritizes their tournament,\" Messi fired back in a TV interview ahead of the Copa Am\u00e9rica opener Thursday between Argentina and Canada. \"The Euros is very important and has the best teams, but he's leaving out three-time champion Argentina, five-time champion Brazil, two-time champion Uruguay.\n\n\"There are a lot of world champions left off to say that it's the most difficult tournament.\"\n\nNot just world champions. In top-ranked Argentina and No. 5 Brazil, the Copa Am\u00e9rica field also has two of the top five teams in the latest FIFA world rankings. Colombia, which is also in the 16-team field, hasn't lost in 23 games over more than two years, the longest unbeaten streak in international soccer.\n\nA third of the 24 teams in the top-heavy Euro field are ranked outside the top 32.\n\nWith that as an introduction, here are four things to watch when the 48th Copa Am\u00e9rica kicks off at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta:\n\nIt's a World Cup dress rehearsal\n\nThe South American championship is being played in the U.S. for the second time in eight years and eight of the 14 venues, including Inglewood's SoFi Stadium, also will play host to games in the 2026 World Cup. That makes the tournament an important trial run.\n\n\"We will always look at every event as a test for the next things that's coming up,\" said Otto Benedict, senior vice president for facility and campus operations at SoFi Stadium. \"Copa will allow us to have an international fan base that's coming through the building, so we're going to understand how those guests come, how they perceive the building.\"\n\nSoFi, which will stage eight games in the World Cup, will host two Copa group-stage matches: Brazil's tournament opener with Costa Rica on June 24 and Mexico's second game, with Venezuela, on June 26.\n\nBenedict said the stadium's Matrix Turf surface will be covered with a carpet of natural grass, a procedure that will be repeated for the World Cup, but the retractable bleachers in the corners will remain in place, leaving the pitch slightly narrower than FIFA will require for the World Cup.\n\n\"We're still going to have opportunities to learn,\" Benedict said. \"All those things are data points that will be collected.\"\n\nThe seven other Copa stadiums staging World Cup matches will conduct similar trials.\n\nCopa Am\u00e9rica will be a World Cup test for the USMNT as well\n\nThe 2026 World Cup will be a defining moment for the U.S., and the Copa might give an indication how the national team will be defined.\n\nIs the U.S. one of the world's top soccer-playing nations, as U.S. Soccer would like you to believe, or is it a pretender, a team that struggles against top competition and is undeserving of being ranked 11th - ahead of Colombia, Germany and Uruguay - in the latest FIFA rankings?\n\nAs a World Cup host, the U.S. - along with co-hosts Mexico and Canada - will not have to go through qualifying for 2026, making Copa the most challenging tournament it will face in the next two years.\n\nThe roster coach Gregg Berhalter will take into the team's opener against Bolivia at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on Saturday is collectively the best in USMNT history, with 23 of 26 players coming off major European clubs. Copa provides an important international stage on which to display those talents.\n\n\"It's a chance for us to show, before the World Cup, that we're a team to be feared,\" defender Chris Richards told reporters.\n\nIs Berhalter up to the task?\n\nNo U.S. manager who has coached more than seven games has a better winning percentage than Berhalter, but given the quality of the roster and the team's recent struggles - the U.S. has won only two of its last six games - he has come under fire. The protests grew louder after an especially poor showing in a 5-1 loss to Colombia earlier this month.\n\nThe Copa group stage, in which the U.S. will play Bolivia, Panama and Uruguay, offers a chance to flip that script. The three teams will present vastly different challenges, giving Berhalter a chance to show off his coaching chops with three different game plans.\n\nGetting out of group play is the bare minimum for the U.S., but matters will get a little tougher if it advances and probably will face either Colombia or Brazil in the quarterfinals.\n\nWhat about the rest of the field?\n\nArgentina, the reigning World Cup champion and ranked No. 1 in the world, has lost only two of its last 57 games and has made the Copa Am\u00e9rica final a record 29 times, winning 15.\n\nAlthough the team led by the 36-year-old Messi has aged - 11 players over 30 and the third-oldest roster in the tournament - it appears to have a fairly comfortable path to a 30th final at Hard Rock Stadium in suburban Miami on July 14.\n\nWith Colombia and Brazil, Group D could be the toughest of the four four-team groups. Brazil, still without injured Neymar, needs to improve play after losing its last three games - albeit to Uruguay, Colombia and Argentina - in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying.\n\nEcuador, whose only losses in 14 games came to Argentina and Italy, could be a dark horse.", "source": {"uri": "bradenton.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bradenton Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

best...", "body": "Before hosting the World Cup in two years, the U.S. is getting an appetizer this summer.\n\nCopa America, South America's continental championship, will be played in America this summer for the first time in eight years, with North American teams invited to compete against the likes of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Uruguay.\n\nThough teams from outside South America have regularly been invited to Copa America, none have ever won the tournament, with Mexico's pair of final appearances in 1993 and 2001 accounting for the best result for a team outside the continent.\n\nThe U.S., Mexico and Canada, however, will be among the teams looking to change that this summer, starting on Thursday night.\n\nThe Post's Ethan Sears breaks down five games to watch in the Copa America group stage:\n\nIt's rare in an international tournament that the opening match is not contested by the host nation, but that will be the case in Miami on Thursday, since Lionel Messi is an enterprise of his own.\n\nArgentina opens its defense of the 2021 Copa title in Messi's new home city against a Canada squad that has struggled since an insurgent campaign to qualify for the 2022 World Cup.\n\nUnder new head coach Jesse Marsch, though, the Canadians will have their eyes on qualification for the knockout stage, with the opener being an immediate litmus test.\n\nOne of two group stage matches to be contested at MetLife Stadium should be one of the highlights of the early part of the tournament.\n\nThe last time Chile and Argentina faced off in New Jersey was in the 2016 Copa America final -- a 0-0 draw that ended with the Chileans winning a penalty shootout to deny Messi's Argentina a first major trophy.\n\nChile's core is on the older side now and it will come as no surprise that Argentina will be considerable favorites in this game.\n\nBut this is a classic South American rivalry and a chance to catch Messi close to home, and that alone qualifies it for this slot.\n\nAs the U.S. has risen to the top of North American soccer, so too has Mexico fallen off a perch it once dominated.\n\nA failure to make it out of the group stage in the Qatar World Cup represented the worst result for Mexico at the tournament since they were banned from the 1990 edition, and the worst at a tournament in which they qualified since 1978.\n\nCoach Jaime Lozano, a native of Mexico, comes into this tournament with the program under immense scrutiny despite winning the 2023 Gold Cup, and with a chance for his squad to prove itself in front of what will be a de facto home crowd in every game.\n\nMexico should get out of a group that also includes Ecuador, Venezuela and Jamaica, but this match against the Ecuadorians will be their biggest test of the three.\n\nIf they can win it -- and likely win the group along with it -- that would likely mean avoiding Argentina in the quarterfinals.\n\nThere is not quite as much unease with the USMNT heading into this tournament as with Mexico, but compared to the optimism heading into the World Cup two years ago, Gregg Berhalter's squad is very much at a crossroads.\n\nUruguay, a traditional South American powerhouse, will be the first major test of this Copa America for a squad that has yet to score a victory against such a team.\n\nThe result here will help set the tone for the discourse around the national team for the next couple years -- though not as much as the ultimate outcome of this tournament -- and is likely to decide the group winner.\n\nIt's a shame that Brazil-Colombia is the Group D finale and not the opener, since it's possible that both teams will have secured advancement by the time they face off.\n\nStill, this looks on paper like the best match of the group stage, and could determine the U.S. opponent in the quarterfinal should the Americans advance.\n\nBrazil is in a particularly interesting spot coming into this tournament, with a new generation headlined by Vinicius Jr., Rodrygo and Endrick stepping into the spotlight.\n\nA 1-1 draw against the USMNT in its last match before the tournament caused histrionics at home, with Brazilian legend Ronaldinho blasting the squad and saying he wouldn't watch the Copa.\n\nWe'll see whether he ultimately goes back on that promise.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New

After previously stating that the 2022 World Cup would be his last, Messi told Star+ in December that \"time will tell.\"\n\n\"As long as I feel I am well and that I am able to help, I will do it,\" Messi, who will turn 37 during the Copa Am\u00e9rica, said. \"Today, all I think about is to get well to the Copa Am\u00e9rica and play it. Fight for it again, as we always do, try to be the champions.\n\n\"If we do well at Copa Am\u00e9rica and I can keep playing, maybe it happens.\"\n\nBut Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni, who has overseen just four defeats in the team's last 50 games, had a message for Messi fans: Don't worry about the future, just enjoy the now.\n\n\"We Argentines are too melancholic and we are already thinking about the day when he is gone while he's still playing,\" Scaloni said last week. \"So let's enjoy him and we'll see what happens tomorrow. I think the present is so important for the whole world - not only for Argentina - because, in the end, Leo plays for everyone who likes football.\"\n\nOne player who will definitely be making his last tournament appearance for Argentina is \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda.\n\nThe 36-year-old has made 140 appearances for the national team and enjoys legendary status back home thanks to his winner in the final of the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica and a goal in the 2022 World Cup final.\n\nDi Mar\u00eda also won the U20 World Cup in 2007 and an Olympic gold medal at Beijing 2008.\n\nThe best of the rest\n\nBrazil\n\nPreviously thought of as one of, if not the greatest football nation on earth, Brazil currently finds itself navigating a complicated transitional period.\n\nThe squad for the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica is largely inexperienced, with 15 players on less than 10 caps for their country. Only one player, West Ham's Lucas Paquet\u00e1, has reached 10 goals for Brazil, making the omissions of Casemiro and Richarlison all the more surprising.\n\nThe Sele\u00e7\u00e3o is still reeling from the absence of star man Neymar Jr., who ruptured his ACL playing for the national team in October. Brazil's all-time record goalscorer and a player with the ability to change a game in an instant, Neymar will be sorely missed for his contributions on the pitch, but also his leadership and status as an icon in an inexperienced dressing room.\n\nBrazil recently suffered back-to-back World Cup qualifier set-backs for the first time in its history, before going on to lose a third in a row. That third defeat - a 1-0 loss to Argentina at the Maracan\u00e3 - was historic, too, marking the first time Brazil had ever lost a home World Cup qualifier.\n\nInterim coach Fernando Diniz was sacked in January, less than halfway through his one-year deal, and replaced by journeyman manager Dorival J\u00fanior, who has so far overseen narrow wins against England and Mexico and draws against the USA and Spain.\n\nBut despite the team's recent struggles, the pressure and expectation will still be high back home - in particular with Vin\u00edcius Jr. leading the attack.\n\nThe Real Madrid forward has enjoyed a sensational season for Los Blancos, helping the team to a La Liga and Champions League double and making himself the favorite to win the Ballon d'Or.\n\nUruguay\n\nPerennial overachiever Uruguay once again goes into a Copa Am\u00e9rica among the favorites to win the title.\n\nThe nation of just 3.5 million people holds the joint record alongside Argentina for most Copa Am\u00e9rica titles won with 15.\n\nUnder new manager Marcelo Bielsa, who took charge in May 2023, a new, youthful Uruguay has made a tremendous start to World Cup qualifying, winning four of its six matches so far - including 2-0 wins over Brazil and Argentina - to sit second in the standings.\n\nWhile Bielsa has called up many inexperienced and uncapped players during his tenure so far to better implement his high intensity press, national team icon Luis Su\u00e1rez made the cut and will be supported by a talented cast that includes Jos\u00e9 Gim\u00e9nez, Ronald Ara\u00fajo and Federico Valverde.\n\nThe host\n\nThe USA enters the Copa Am\u00e9rica off the back of winning a third straight Nations League title, beating bitter rival Mexico 2-0 in the final less than two months ago.\n\nHowever, preparations for the tournament got off to the worst possible start with a 5-1 hammering at the hands of Colombia in Washington.\n\nAfter the defeat, goalkeeper Matt Turner said the team needed to \"bounce back in a big way,\" and a much-improved performance followed in a morale-boosting 1-1 draw against Brazil.\n\nDespite boasting several talented players, including Tim Weah, Christian Pulisic, Yunus Musah and Folarin Balogun, serious questions remain about whether the US men can consistently compete against teams outside of the weaker CONCACAF bubble.\n\nFortunately for the US, the group draw has been kind. First up is a weak Bolivia side which has endured an abysmal start to World Cup qualifying, losing five of its first six matches, before a clash against familiar CONCACAF opponent Panama.\n\nThe sternest test will come last against Uruguay, but Gregg Berhalter's side should have enough quality to at least advance to the knockout stages. Anything less could be a disaster as the team attempts to drum up support across the country ahead of a home World Cup.\n\nDark Horses\n\nChile\n\nOnly a couple of months ago, you will likely have been hard pressed to find a Chile fan optimistic enough to predict that the team would make it past the group stages.\n\nThe failure to qualify for back-to-back World Cups in 2018 and 2022 has been a bitter pill to swallow for everyone involved after the country's 'Golden Generation' won successive Copa Am\u00e9ricas in 2015 and 2016 and reached the final of the 2017 Confederations Cup.\n\nSince Juan Antonio Pizzi was sacked as manager after the team missed out on Russia 2018, three successive coaches failed to get a tune out of the team - then Ricardo Gareca was hired.\n\nGareca, who impressively took Peru to the 2018 World Cup and the final of the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica, has had an immediate impact on the team since taking over in January, leading La Roja to comprehensive 3-0 wins over Paraguay and Albania and pushing France close in a 3-2 defeat in Marseille.\n\nBig names such as Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Claudio Bravo remain in the squad, but there is no place for Arturo Vidal or Gary Medel.\n\nIt might be a bit much to say expectations are now high, but fans are finally excited about watching La Roja playing again.\n\nColombia\n\nColombia arrives in the US as arguably the most in-form team in the tournament, if not the world.\n\nLos Cafeteros are currently on a 23-game unbeaten run that includes wins in their last eight matches. With three wins and three draws so far in World Cup qualifying, the team has soared to third place in the standings to put the failure of reaching Qatar 2022 behind it.\n\nLiverpool's Luis D\u00edaz will be Colombia's main man at the Copa Am\u00e9rica, supported by well-known veterans such as James Rodriguez, David Ospina and Yerry Mina.\n\nThe main issue for Colombia is its brutal potential route to the final, during which it will likely have to face Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType":

As the 2022 World Cup champions and defending Copa America winners, Lionel Messi and Argentina certainly appear poised to put on another top-tier performance. The odds-on favorites to hoist the Copa America trophy at +175, but the USMNT can't be counted out.\n\nSitting at No. 11 in the FIFA World Rankings, the United States Men's National Team enter Copa America determined to make a deep run. By snapping its 11-game losing streak against Brazil last week, the USMNT gained some much-needed confidence ahead of the tournament kickoff.\n\nThe U.S. sits at +1400 to win the CONMEBOL Copa America and depending on the sportsbook, near or equal to archrival Mexico.\n\nCopa America picks for USMNT & more\n\nIf you comb through the top Copa America sportsbook apps including BetMGM, DraftKings and others, you will find plenty of options surrounding the United States.\n\nOf course, there are odds to win Copa America but sportsbooks also include odds to win and qualify from Group C, individual player and team props and betting lines for each game.\n\nBelow are our favorite United States Copa America picks:\n\nUSA Copa America Best Bets: USMNT to win Group C (+140 or better)\n\nThe United States is planted closely behind Uruguay (-145) when it comes to winning the group. These two don't meet up until the third group stage game, so there's plenty to play out beforehand.\n\nThe USA must beat Bolivia in their opening match Sunday (6 p.m. ET) and get another result from Panama (June 27, 6 p.m.) to give themselves a realistic shot at the group, but it's entirely possible to cash this plus-money bet and it provides a rooting interest over multiple matches.\n\nCopa America USA best bets: Christian Pulisic top USA goal scorer (+380 or better)\n\nUSA wunderkind Christian Pulisic is eager to show why he should have been called up for the 2023 Gold Cup.\n\nThe AC Milan midfielder made his presence felt in Serie A last year, finding the back of the net 12 times and tallying eight assists. Pulisic is the USMNT's biggest threat in the scoring third, so expect him to be at - or near - the top of the list of the Yanks' goal scoring leaders.\n\nIf you want to take a dark horse bet involving the United States' most important player, he's +4000 at DraftKings to lead the tournament in scoring.\n\nUSMNT Copa America picks: To Win All Group C Games (+450 or better)\n\nConsider this among the many Copa America long shot picks you can make and while it's not too likely, it's certainly possible.\n\nThe USMNT did receive a 5-1 shellacking at the hands of Colombia ahead of the Copa America, their 1-1 draw against Brazil should inspire confidence in their performance in Group C.\n\nUruguay poises the largest looming challenge, the Yanks have fared well against La Celeste of late, posting draws in their last two meetings. Striker Luis Suarez will pose the biggest challenge, but with USMNT notching 11 saves against Brazil, the defense seems up for the challenge.\n\nDue to confederation familiarity, the fixture against Panama is another one to watch - especially considering the USA's loss to them in last year's Gold Cup. They're 5-3-2 against them in the last 10 meetings. This market can be found at DraftKings.\n\nYou must be over 21 to play. Gambling Problem?

Through a partnership between CONMEBOL, the South American soccer federation that hosts the tournament every four years, and North America's CONCACAF, Copa America will feature six CONCACAF teams participating as guests.\n\nThe six CONCACAF nations competing in Copa America 2024 are: the United States, Mexico, Canada, Jamaica, Panama and Costa Rica.\n\nThe groups of the CONMEBOL's Copa America are:\n\nHere is a breakdown of the Copa America championships in history:", "source": {"uri": "wfaa.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFAA-TV Channel 8"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CONCACAF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Costa Rica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Costa Rica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Panama"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Panama"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Petanque", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Petanque", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Croquet", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Croquet", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://media.wfaa.com/assets/WFAA/images/dc3c26e8-c724-4591-bacd-013be80a9c04/20240619T114816/dc3c26e8-c724-4591-bacd-013be80a9c04_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658543", "eventUri": "eng-9658543", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Lionel Messi knows it is", "body": "LOS ANGELES -- Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 clearly ruffled some feathers last week when he suggested the European Championship was the world's most difficult international soccer competition.\n\n\"The Euros are complicated. For me, more complicated than a World Cup,\" the French national team captain said at a news conference before his team's first game.\n\nHold my beer, said former club teammate Lionel Messi, who led Argentina past France in an epic 2022 World Cup final, in which he and Mbapp\u00e9 -- who broke his nose in France's Euro-opening win over Austria on Monday -- combined for five of the game's six goals.\n\nSure the Euros, the quadrennial championship for FIFA's 55-member European confederation, is difficult. However, don't sleep on Copa Am\u00e9rica, the South American tournament expanded this year to include the U.S., Mexico and four other teams.\n\n\"Well, everybody prioritizes their tournament,\" Messi fired back in a TV interview ahead of the Copa Am\u00e9rica opener Thursday between Argentina and Canada. \"The Euros is very important and has the best teams, but he's leaving out three-time champion Argentina, five-time champion Brazil, two-time champion Uruguay.\n\n\"There are a lot of world champions left off to say that it's the most difficult tournament.\"\n\nNot just world champions. In top-ranked Argentina and No. 5 Brazil, the Copa Am\u00e9rica field also has two of the top five teams in the latest FIFA world rankings. Colombia, which is also in the 16-team field, hasn't lost in 23 games over more than two years, the longest unbeaten streak in international soccer.\n\nA third of the 24 teams in the top-heavy Euro field are ranked outside the top 32.\n\nWith that as an introduction, here are four things to watch when the 48th Copa Am\u00e9rica kicks off at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta:\n\nThe South American championship is being played in the U.S. for the second time in eight years and eight of the 14 venues, including Inglewood's SoFi Stadium, also will play host to games in the 2026 World Cup. That makes the tournament an important trial run.\n\n\"We will always look at every event as a test for the next things that's coming up,\" said Otto Benedict, senior vice president for facility and campus operations at SoFi Stadium. \"Copa will allow us to have an international fan base that's coming through the building, so we're going to understand how those guests come, how they perceive the building.\"\n\nSoFi, which will stage eight games in the World Cup, will host two Copa group-stage matches: Brazil's tournament opener with Costa Rica on June 24 and Mexico's second game, with Venezuela, on June 26.\n\nBenedict said the stadium's Matrix Turf surface will be covered with a carpet of natural grass, a procedure that will be repeated for the World Cup, but the retractable bleachers in the corners will remain in place, leaving the pitch slightly narrower than FIFA will require for the World Cup.\n\n\"We're still going to have opportunities to learn,\" Benedict said. \"All those things are data points that will be collected.\"\n\nThe seven other Copa stadiums staging World Cup matches will conduct similar trials.\n\nThe 2026 World Cup will be a defining moment for the U.S., and the Copa might give an indication how the national team will be defined.\n\nIs the U.S. one of the world's top soccer-playing nations, as U.S. Soccer would like you to believe, or is it a pretender, a team that struggles against top competition and is undeserving of being ranked 11th -- ahead of Colombia, Germany and Uruguay -- in the latest FIFA rankings?\n\nAs a World Cup host, the U.S. -- along with co-hosts Mexico and Canada -- will not have to go through qualifying for 2026, making Copa the most challenging tournament it will face in the next two years.\n\nThe roster coach Gregg Berhalter will take into the team's opener against Bolivia at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on Saturday is collectively the best in USMNT history, with 23 of 26 players coming off major European clubs. Copa provides an important international stage on which to display those talents.\n\n\"It's a chance for us to show, before the World Cup, that we're a team to be feared,\" defender Chris Richards told reporters.\n\nNo U.S. manager who has coached more than seven games has a better winning percentage than Berhalter, but given the quality of the roster and the team's recent struggles -- the U.S. has won only two of its last six games -- he has come under fire. The protests grew louder after an especially poor showing in a 5-1 loss to Colombia earlier this month.\n\nThe Copa group stage, in which the U.S. will play Bolivia, Panama and Uruguay, offers a chance to flip that script. The three teams will present vastly different challenges, giving Berhalter a chance to show off his coaching chops with three different game plans.\n\nGetting out of group play is the bare minimum for the U.S., but matters will get a little tougher if it advances and probably will face either Colombia or Brazil in the quarterfinals.\n\nArgentina, the reigning World Cup champion and ranked No. 1 in the world, has lost only two of its last 57 games and has made the Copa Am\u00e9rica final a record 29 times, winning 15.\n\nAlthough the team led by the 36-year-old Messi has aged -- 11 players over 30 and the third-oldest roster in the tournament -- it appears to have a fairly comfortable path to a 30th final at Hard Rock Stadium in suburban Miami on July 14.\n\nWith Colombia and Brazil, Group D could be the toughest of the four four-team groups. Brazil, still without injured Neymar, needs to improve play after losing its last three games -- albeit to Uruguay, Colombia and Argentina -- in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying.\n\nEcuador, whose only losses in 14 games came to Argentina and Italy, could be a dark horse.", "source": {"uri": "courant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hartfort Courant"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He's also the author of \"Net Gains: Inside the Beautiful Game's Analytics Revolution.\"\n\nThe last time the United States hosted a Copa America in 2016, Brazil got knocked out in the group stages. The U.S. men's national team lost 4-0 to Argentina in the semifinals. And Argentina lost the final in penalties to Chile at MetLife Stadium, home of the New York Giants and Jets. It was Argentina's second loss to Chile in a Copa America final in as many years, and it led to Lionel Messi -- presumably distraught at being unable to live up to the legacies created by Eli Manning and Ryan Fitzpatrick on that same field -- retiring from international soccer immediately following the match.\n\nWhile Messi has spent his career expanding our collective imagination of what's possible on a soccer field and in a soccer career, I don't think anyone could've accurately predicted where we'd be eight years later. Messi is in Year 2 of playing for Inter Miami, a soccer team that didn't exist in 2016. He spent two barely memorable seasons playing for Paris Saint-Germain. Oh, and he unretired so he and Argentina could finally win the Copa America and World Cup in consecutive years in his mid-30s.\n\nElsewhere, Chile have since failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup and the 2022 World Cup. The other semifinalists in 2016 missed one a piece: the U.S. failed to qualify for 2018, Colombia for 2022. Brazil didn't make it past the quarterfinals of either tournament, and just two players from their 2016 Copa team are still around in 2024 (Alisson and Marquinhos).\n\nMexico, meanwhile, continue to lose to the USMNT in the Nations League, a tournament that didn't exist eight years ago. And Canada are managed by Jesse Marsch -- a statement that would've been meaningless in 2016 but not so today because he's managed multiple clubs in the Champions League and the Premier League since the Copa America Centenario.\n\nThe Copa America is the kind of tournament that can change the course of soccer as we know it, and it really matters to the teams that participate. So, given all the twists and turns we've had since the last time a Copa America was played on U.S. soil, why not look at the state of the 2024 tournament and make some predictions for where this all might end up?\n\nIt's time to look into our stats-filled, analytics-powered crystal ball and predict how every single game of the 2024 Copa America plays out and who, ultimately, will be crowned the winner.

Copa America record: goals, assists, standout moments", "body": "Sports Mole takes a look at Lionel Messi's for Argentina at the Copa America, including goals, assists and standout moments.\n\nyou have updates\n\nArgentina star Lionel Messi will feature at a seventh Copa America when he represents his country at this summer's tournament in the USA.\n\nThe forward clinched his first international title at Copa America 2021, before he led La Albiceleste to World Cup glory in December 2022.\n\nAlthough he is set to turn 37, Messi still remains a key player for Lionel Scaloni's side and will be crucial to their hopes of winning a third consecutive major tournament.\n\nHere, Sports Mole takes a look at Messi's previous performances at the tournament, including his goal contributions and standout moments.\n\nCopa America 2007 - 2 goals, 1 assist\n\nThe little boy from Rosario made his Copa America debut in 2007 just a year after he made his first major tournament appearance at the 2006 World Cup.\n\nA 20-year-old Messi provided just an assist in the group stage, before he finally got on the scoresheet in Argentina's quarter-final demolition.\n\nMessi made an intelligent run inside to collect Rodrigo Riquelme's exquisite through ball and slot home his first-ever goal at the Copa America.\n\nHis finish in the quarter-final may have been regarded as a relatively simple one, but there was nothing ordinary about the sumptuous strike he produced in the last-four success against Mexico.\n\nWith Argentina a goal to the good, Messi picked up the ball on the right side of the box and opened up his body to conjure up an audacious lob that teased the outstretched Oswaldo Sanchez before nestling in the far corner.\n\nUnfortunately for Messi, his maiden Copa America ended in disappointment as Argentina slumped to a devastating 3-0 defeat to rivals Brazil in the final.\n\nCopa America 2011 - 0 goals, 3 assists\n\nAfter failing to trouble the scorers at the 2010 World Cup, Messi would have hoped to experience improved fortunes at the 2011 Copa America in Argentina.\n\nAs it proved, the attacker would endure another goalless tournament, although he did provide three assists in Argentina's four matches.\n\nHe also kept his composure to dispatch Argentina's first penalty in the quarter-final shootout against Uruguay, but Carlos Tevez failed to convert his spot-kick, ensuring La Albiceleste failed to reach the semi-finals for the first time since 1999.\n\nCopa America 2015 - 1 goal, 3 assists\n\nMessi participated in his second Copa America final in 2015 after helping Argentina progress through the group stage and oust Colombia and Paraguay in the knockout rounds.\n\nHe proved to be a thorn in Paraguay's side, scoring in the opening group game before providing three assists when the two nations met again in Argentina's 6-1 semi-final success.\n\nMessi scored his penalty in the quarter-final shootout against Colombia, and he repeated the feat in the final with Chile after the two countries had played out a goalless draw in Santiago.\n\nHowever, Gonzalo Higuain and Ever Banega were unable to follow Messi's lead as they fluffed their lines to hand Chile the trophy at their home tournament.\n\nCopa America 2016 - 4 goal, 4 assists\n\nJust a year later, Messi and Argentina experienced more penalty shootout heartbreak in another Copa America final against Chile.\n\nMessi sat out Argentina's opening group game with Chile due to a back problem, but he returned with a bang in their next fixture, netting his one and only hat-trick at a major tournament to fire his country to a 5-0 victory.\n\nThe Argentine magician then produced two phenomenal displays in the quarter-final and semi-final, registering a goal and two assists in both games against Venezuela and the USA.\n\nUnfortunately for Messi, those match-winning performances failed to translate into silverware as he and Lucas Biglia missed their penalties in the final shootout with Chile, leaving him to contemplate whether a major international honour would ever come his way.\n\nCopa America 2019 - 4 goals, 4 assists\n\nAfter having three years to reflect on the 2016 disappointment, Messi's return to the Copa America did not go according to plan as he mustered just one goal and one assist in the 2019 tournament.\n\nArgentina's hopes of winning the competition were quashed by a 2-0 semi-final defeat against Brazil, leaving Messi and his colleagues to fight over the third spot with Chile.\n\nMessi teed up Sergio Aguera for the opener in the third-place playoff, but his tournament ultimately ended with a rare red card after he was dismissed for his part in a confrontation with Gary Medel, who was also dismissed in a game that finished 2-1 in Argentina's favour.\n\nCopa America 2021 - 4 goals, 5 assists\n\nAs Messi entered another international tournament, there were certainly some doubts as to whether he would ever celebrate a title with Argentina after falling short in the 2014 World Cup final and three Copa America finals.\n\nHowever, all those years of anguish and frustration were finally laid to rest as Messi ended his long wait for international success in Brazil three years ago.\n\nMessi set out his stall with a goal and an assist in Argentina's opening two games, before he moved through the gears with a scintillating display in the final group game against Bolivia, setting up Papu Gomez for the opener before netting a brace to fire La Albiceleste to a 4-1 victory.\n\nThe former Barcelona star continued to lead from the front in the 3-0 quarter-final success over Ecuador, grabbing two assists and netting a trademark free-kick.\n\nMessi then registered an assist in the semi-final against Colombia, before he held his nerve to score in Argentina's penalty shootout success, setting up a mouthwatering final against bitter rivals Brazil.\n\nIt was perhaps fitting that 14 years after losing to Brazil in his first major international tournament final, the attacker finally got over the line against the same opponent thanks to Angel Di Maria's at the Maracana, generating the iconic scene of Messi's teammates running towards him as soon as the final whistle blew.\n\nIf there was one drawback to the 2021 triumph it was that the tournament was played behind closed doors due to COVID, so Messi may have that extra motivation to win the Copa America in front of his adoring faithful when he leads Argentina in the 2024 compettion.\n\nbody check tags ::", "source": {"uri": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk",

He is either tied for second with Ali Daei or one behind, depending on whether a disputed goal by the Iranian is counted, trailing only Portugal\u00b4s Cristiano Ronaldo at 128.\n\n\"It is not easy to compete again after winning it all,\" Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said.\n\nArgentina and Uruguay are tied with 15 Copa titles each, followed by Brazil with nine. No other nation has won more than two.\n\nFILE - Argentina's Lionel Messi celebrates with the trophy after beating Brazil 1-0 in the Copa America final soccer match at Maracana stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Saturday, July 10, 2021.

(AP Photo/Bruna Prado, File)\n\nBrazil features an attack headed by Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior and Rodrygo, just off a Champions League title with Real Madrid, and Raphinha. The emerging star is 17-year-old Endrick, who joins Real Madrid this summer.\n\n\"If you look at every position in their proposed starting 11, it\u00b4s probably one of the world\u00b4s best players,\" U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter said.\n\nSpain is the only nation to win three consecutive major titles: the European Championship in 2008 and 2012 around the 2010 World Cup.\n\nA look at the tournament:\n\nThere will be 16 teams, just as in 2016. The U.S., Mexico, Canada, Costa Rica, Panama and Jamaica join the 10 South American nations after qualifying from North and Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nEcuador was to host the tournament under the rotation of CONMEBOL, South American soccer\u00b4s governing body, but declined. The tournament was then moved to the U.S., which also hosted the special centennial Copa America in 2016 as Chile won on penalty kicks over Argentina at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\nEleven NFL stadiums are being used, including eight of the 11 U.S. venues for the 2026 World Cup, plus three smaller MLS homes. The final will be at Miami Gardens, Florida, on July 14, starting five hours after the European Championship final in Berlin.\n\nCONMEBOL says more than 1 million tickets have been sold for the 32 matches. The 2016 tournament drew just under 1.5 million, and the 2019 tournament in Brazil about 850,000. The 2021 Copa was played mostly without fans because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThis will be the biggest test for the U.S. team before the World Cup - the Americans get an automatic berth as co-host along with Mexico and Canada - and most Europe-based players are expected to skip next year's CONCACAF Gold Cup.\n\nChristian Pulisic, Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie are the core of a team that returns 18 players from the 2022 World Cup roster.\n\n\"A World Cup on home soil is the biggest thing that you know we\u00b4ll probably do in our career,\" Pulisic said. \"It\u00b4s a special time for this sport in America.\"\n\nIn 2016, CONMEBOL partnered with the U.S. Soccer Federation, which was in charge of most of the logistics. This time, CONMEBOL is co-organizing the tournament with CONCACAF, the governing body of North and Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nUnlike during the World Cup, the organizers have only short-term access to venues. At Hard Rock, a concert is scheduled for July 6, between the last group stage game and the final, and a new grass surface will be installed.\n\nAt MetLife Stadium, where a semifinal will be played July 9, staff will look at it as a preview for the World Cup final on July 19, 2026. The stadium has a camera system designed by Arecont Vision and managed by Genetec Security Center that was installed before the 2014 Super Bowl and a new system by Axis Communications is being put in place this summer in the seating bowl with 80 8K, 41-megapixel cameras.\n\n\"We can see every seat all the time. I think it serves as a good deterrent,\" said Daniel DeLorenzi, vice president of security and safety services. \"We have three drone detection systems. ... Not only can we track the drone, but more importantly, we can track where the operator is.\"\n\nAP sports: https://apnews.com/sports\n\nFILE - Teammates toss Argentina's Lionel Messi in the air after beating Brazil 1-0 in the Copa America final soccer match at the Maracana stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, July 10, 2021.

Can Argentina be champions again?\n\nHow times have changed for Argentina. Three years ago, the country's press and fans were openly wondering if the Albiceleste would ever win another major trophy as their title drought approached three decades. That changed when Lionel Scaloni's men beat Brazil in the final of the 2021 Copa America at Rio de Janeiro's Maracana stadium.\n\nLess than 18 months later, they went one better by lifting the World Cup trophy for the first time since 1986 with a penalty shootout victory over France in Qatar.\n\nLionel Messi (C) of Argentina competes during the 2026 FIFA World Cup South American qualification match against Uruguay in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on Nov. 16, 2023. (Photo by Martin Sabala/Xinhua)\n\nBut can the South American giants make it three major trophies in a row?\n\nRecent results would suggest so. The Albiceleste have been in ominous form of late, having scored three goals or more in three of their past four matches, including a 4-1 rout of Guatemala in their final Copa America warmup fixture last Friday (June 14).\n\nAnother triumph in the United States would make Scaloni's side the first team to successfully defend the Copa America while simultaneously holding the World Cup trophy.\n\n2. Is this really the United States' Golden Generation?\n\nManager Gregg Berhalter has what is arguably the strongest playing list ever assembled by the United States for a major football tournament.\n\nEighteen of the 26 players named in Berhalter's squad ply their trade in one of Europe's top leagues (England, Spain, Italy, France, Germany and the Netherlands).\n\nThe midfield looks particularly dangerous, marshaled by Juventus star Weston McKennie, AC Milan's Yunus Musah and Nottingham Forest playmaker Giovanni Reyna.\n\nThe attack will be led by Christian Pulisic, who says he is in career-best form after a superb season at AC Milan.\n\n3. Brazil's new Golden Boy\n\nEndrick this month became the youngest player since Pele to score in three consecutive matches for Brazil. But the 17-year-old is no certainty to start for the Selecao at the Copa America.\n\nHead coach Dorival Junior has promised not to ask too much of Endrick during the Copa America as the attacker vies for a place in the starting lineup alongside Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, Raphinha, Savinho and Gabriel Martinelli.\n\n\"I have always been in favor of giving chances to young players but I just ask for a little patience with the boy so that things can happen naturally,\" Dorival told reporters earlier this month.\n\n4: Uruguay: The Bielsa effect\n\nUpon his appointment as Uruguay's manager in May last year, Marcelo Bielsa said his role would involve daring the Celeste's players to dream. The team's impressive sequence of results under the Argentine would suggest he is succeeding.\n\nThe Celeste have won seven, drawn three and lost two matches under Bielsa's stewardship, a run that has included World Cup qualifying victories over Brazil and Argentina.\n\nBielsa's 26-man Copa America list includes a balanced mix of youth and experience while boasting an array of world-class talent such as Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde, Barcelona defender Ronald Araujo, Atletico Madrid defender Jose Gimenez and Liverpool forward Darwin Nunez.\n\nVeteran marksman Luis Suarez will likely be an option off the bench, despite his prolific recent scoring form for Inter Miami. Suarez's long-time national team strike partner Edinson Cavani is not a part of the Celeste squad after announcing his retirement from international football in May.\n\n5. Colombia's formidable form\n\nColombia will deservedly enter the Copa America as one of the tournament favorites. The Cafeteros are unbeaten in 20 matches since Argentine Nestor Lorenzo replaced Reinaldo Rueda as manager in June 2022.\n\nThe sequence has included victories over Germany, Spain, Brazil, Mexico and the United States over the past year.\n\nColombia's strength is a stable defense - led by the center-back pairing of Jhon Lucumi and Carlos Cuesta - and an attack spearheaded by Liverpool winger Luis Diaz.\n\nPerhaps one weak spot is the middle of the park. James Rodriguez and Jhon Arias are the central pieces of a midfield that could lack depth, particularly if injuries strike.\n\n6. Gareca's Copa America record\n\nChile boss Ricardo Gareca, has a Midas touch in the Copa America, having guided Peru to second and third places in the previous two editions.\n\nThe 66-year-old Argentine, who was appointed Chile manager in January, has shown that he is not afraid to make tough decisions as he oversees a generational overhaul of La Roja's squad.\n\nAmong those missing from Chile's current playing group are Arturo Vidal and Gary Medel, integral members of the side that won back-to-back Copa America titles in 2015 and 2016.\n\nOne veteran who has remained in Gareca's plans is Eduardo Vargas, who was the Copa America's leading scorer in both 2015 and 2016, with four and six goals, respectively.\n\nThe 34-year-old Atletico Mineiro forward has 14 Copa America goals, three shy of the record that is jointly held by Argentine midfielder Norberto Mendez and Brazil playmaker Zizinho.\n\n7. The last dance?\n\nWhile Lionel Messi has not yet entertained the idea of retirement - at least publicly - this will almost certainly be his last Copa America.\n\nArgentina's talismanic captain will turn 37 during the tournament's group stage and he will be 41 when the next edition comes around.\n\nOne player who has already made a decision about his future is Messi's long-time national teammate and close friend, Angel Di Maria.\n\nThe 36-year-old has confirmed that he will end his 16-year international career after the Copa America.\n\nThe Benfica winger has been capped 140 times for his country and, with one World Cup trophy and a Copa America triumph to his name, he is already guaranteed legend status for the Albiceleste. Who would deny him one last shot at glory?\n\n8. Venezuela's high hopes\n\nVenezuela have never progressed beyond the quarterfinals of the continental tournament, having reached the last eight in 2011 and 2016.\n\nBut the Vinotinto have good reason to believe this could be their best ever Copa America campaign.\n\nSince Fernando Batista replaced Jose Pekerman as head coach in March 2023, Venezuela have played 12 matches, winning five, drawing five and losing just two.\n\nThe encouraging run of results has included victories over Chile and Paraguay and a draw against Brazil in 2026 World Cup qualifiers.", "source": {"uri": "china.org.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "China.org.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Scaloni", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Scaloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Berhalter", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gregg Berhalter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_Bielsa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marcelo Bielsa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CONCACAF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

They have been spotless, winning four games by a combined score of 11-2. Canada's form hasn't been as good, with a 1-1-1 record in 2024, including a loss and a tie in June. Canada didn't take it easy going into the tournament, taking on Netherlands and France in those two friendly matches. It is time to continue our Copa America odds series with an Argentina-Canada prediction, pick, and how-to-watch.\n\nArgentina has been the best country in international soccer since losing to Saudi Arabia in the 2022 World Cup. After losing the opening game of that tournament, Argentina won six consecutive games, finishing the journey with a penalty kick victory over France in the final. The Argentinians sent Lionel Messi into World Cup retirement with his first-ever title, as one of soccer's greatest players said the Qatar World Cup would be his last. However, he isn't ready to call it quits yet, as he will be playing in the Copa America, which is likely his final significant international competition.\n\nCanada has lost some steam after their dramatic qualification for the 2022 World Cup. The tournament didn't go as planned for Canada, and they've lost big games in the Concacaf Gold Cup and Concacaf Nations League since their elimination in Qatar. Canada won't have to go through the dramatics of qualifying for the 2026 World Cup, as they're co-hosting the tournament with the United States and Mexico. The Copa America will be a good chance for the Canadian team to get back on track.\n\nArgentina's reasons to win are clear. They lost one match in their last 20, a qualifying game against Uruguay. Argentina has run over teams that are better than Canada on this path, and they could be highly motivated to win the Copa America. If this is Messi's last tournament they'll want to send him off on a winning note, and they could become just the second nation ever to win three consecutive major titles after winning the 2021 Copa America and 2022 World Cup.\n\nWhy Canada Will Win\n\nCanada has some crucial players in their squad, including Alphonso Davies, one of the best full-backs in the world, and Jonathan David, one of the top goal-scorers in Ligue 1. The Canadians used these players and other unsung heroes to qualify for the 2022 World Cup. However, once they got to the big stage, they realized the difficulties of playing some of the better teams in the world for an entire tournament.\n\nCanada will be prepared better in Copa America, but this opening-round matchup with Argentina is a difficult draw. Canada could make some noise against Peru and Chile and advance to the knockout stage, but they'll need heroic performances to get past Argentina. Their most significant reason to believe is Argentina's propensity to start the bigger tournaments on the wrong foot, as we saw in the 2022 World Cup against Saudi Arabia.\n\nFinal Argentina-Canada Prediction & Pick\n\nArgentina's odds are astronomical to win this game since most expect them to dominate the group stage. Their odds of -350 are too juiced for a team that lost their World Cup opener to Saudi Arabia. The better value in this matchup is on the over, as Argentina could cover this number themselves, but Canada can also contribute a goal or two. Jonathan David and Alphonso Davies are more than capable of combining on a goal against the Argentinians.\n\nClick here for more betting news & predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nate_duffett@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Nate Duffett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF_Gold_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CONCACAF Gold Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Nations_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Nations League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonso_Davies", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphonso Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligue_1", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ligue 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peru"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Peru"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Argentina-vs-Canada-2024-Copa-America-prediction-odds-pick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658543", "eventUri": "eng-9658543", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

The Albiceleste get the tournament underway on Thursday.\n\nWorld champions Argentina get an expanded Copa Am\u00e9rica under way on Thursday with Lionel Messi looking to add a second continental title in what is almost certainly his final appearance in the tournament.\n\nThe 108-year-old competition is being held in the United States with the host nation among six teams from the CONCACAF region joining the 10 South American nations looking for a place in the July 14 final in Miami.\n\nWhile FIFA will be looking closely at the organisation of the event, two years out from the World Cup which will be co-hosted by the USA, Canada and Mexico, the tournament's rich history and prestige means it is much, much more than a 'trial event.'\n\nArgentina have won the Copa Am\u00e9rica 15 times but only once, in 2021, during the Messi era and coach Lionel Scaloni has stuck largely with his World Cup-winning squad, with veterans \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda and Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi likely taking their final bow in a major tournament.\n\nWhether this is Messi's goodbye to elite international football remains to be seen - the eight-times Ballon d'Or winner, now playing in Major League Soccer with Inter Miami, will turn 37 four days after Thursday's opener in Atlanta against Canada and has yet to decide whether he will try to play in a record sixth World Cup.\n\n\"It's great to have records and continue to achieve things but I won't take part in a World Cup just to say I've done six,\" Messi told ESPN last week.\n\n\"If I feel good and everything is in place for me to be there, fine, but I won't go just to go. It's very difficult to imagine what can happen because it's still two years away. I don't need to commit right now to whether or not I'll be there,\" he added.\n\nWhat is certain is that Messi, who has managed his workload to try to be in peak condition for the tournament, would relish the chance to win a third straight major tournament with his country after so many years of frustration with his national team.\n\nAfter facing Canada, Argentina take on Chile in New Jersey before finishing their group A action against Peru in Miami but they know that tough opposition awaits in the knock-out stage with rivals Brazil and Uruguay the two expected challengers for the title.\n\nBrazil have struggled in CONMEBOL qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup having won just two of their opening six games and they currently sit in sixth place in the standings having lost to Uruguay, Colombia and Argentina.\n\nThere are several familiar names missing from Dorival Junior's Brazil squad with Casemiro, Gabriel Jesus and Thiago Silva left out while Richarlison and Neymar are both missing due to injury.\n\nThe pressure will be on the Real Madrid attacking pair of Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior and Rodrygo to translate their club form into success for the Sele\u00e7ao while there is much excitement around the senior tournament debut of 17-year-old talent Endrick, who is set to join Real next month from Palmeiras.\n\nUruguay, also 15-times winners, have impressed under their 68-year-old Argentina coach Marcelo Bielsa, who has brought his trademark high-energy style to the team and raised expectations with recent wins over Argentina and Brazil.\n\nLiverpool forward Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez will lead the line although Bielsa has the option of introducing veteran Luis Su\u00e1rez from the bench.\n\nColombia head into the tournament without a loss in over two years and with Liverpool's livewire winger Luis D\u00edaz a constant threat and James Rodr\u00edguez enjoying a late career revival, Nestor Lorenzo's team can't be discounted.\n\nThe USA will hope that they can generate some sorely needed excitement after losing their way since a creditable run to the last-16 at the World Cup.\n\nCoach Gregg Berhalter is under some pressure to show he can get his team, which relies on the smart wing play of Christian Pulisic, to compete with teams from outside of CONCACAF.\n\nMexico have guested frequently in the Copa in the past and reached the final in 1993 and 2001, but they look well below their usual level although they can, as always, count on huge support in the USA.\n\nThis is the second time the Copa Am\u00e9rica is being held in the USA, after the centenary tournament in 2016, and while that is a break with tradition the presence of significant immigrant communities from all the competing nations, should ensure big crowds at the mostly NFL stadiums being used.", "source": {"uri": "batimes.com.ar", "dataType": "news", "title": "Buenos Aires Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@batimes.com.ar", "name": "Agence

MAXPPP - Le Parisien/Arnaud Journois\n\nThe 48th Copa America is being played in the United States against a backdrop of rivalry between Argentina and Brazil.\n\nThe reigning Argentine world champions, led by their totem Lionel Messi, and Vinicius Jr's Brazil, in great shape, are dreaming of the 48th Copa America, played in the United States, from Thursday until the 14th. ;July. The tournament launches a series of three major competitions in the land of \"soccer\", before the new version of the FIFA Club World Cup in 2025 and then the 48-country Gigantism World Cup co-organized with Mexico and Canada in 2026.\n\nLionel Messi has not ruled out still being present in 2026, but for the moment he is eyeing the Copa America, which he finally won with the ;rsquo;Argentina in 2021. In an experienced group which includes 22 world champions, Messi obviously finds Angel di Maria or even Lautaro Martinez.\n\nThe eight-time Ballon d'Or, who will celebrate its 37th anniversary on June 24, will open the competition against Canada on Thursday in Atlanta before a shock in the first round on June 25 against Chile, reminder of the two finals lost by the Albiceleste in 2015 and 2016. Messi is even more the face of this Copa since he has been playing at Inter Miami since July 2023.\n\nThe city with a Latino accent (the community most focused on \"soccer\" in the USA) is establishing itself as the new stronghold of American football, where the final will take place of the tournament and where Fifa has set up offices. Freed from the rhythm and harshness of European football, Messi offers himself the luxury of arriving fresher at the Copa, little marked by the senatorial train of the MLS championship, where he continues to pile up the goals (12 after 19 days) without being criticized for his lack of races.\n\nWith his dragster acceleration, Vinicius Junior has brought European football into line, recently winning a second Champions League with Real Madrid, and establishing himself as leader of Brazil, another giant of the world. South America, in the absence of Neymar, operated in November for a rupture of the cruciate ligaments and meniscus of the left knee.\n\n\"I haven't won a national team title yet, I hope to do so now. We prepared well. This generation is strong and we want to do great things with the Sele\u00e7ao\", said Vinicius, who will celebrate his 24th birthday on July 12.\n\nHe will play in the Sele\u00e7ao with his Real teammates Rodrygo (attacker) and Eder Militao (defender), and will be able to cover his future Madrid teammate Endrick, the new star of Auriverde football who is playing at 17 years old his first big tournament.\n\nJoint record holder for the number of victories in the competition with Argentina (15), Uruguay advances with Darwin Nunez and the eternal Luis Suarez, Messi's teammate in Miami, but without Edinson Cavani, who announced his international retirement at the end of May. Argentina's Marcelo Bielsa will sit on the bench (or the icebox) of the Celeste, in search of a first personal Copa after his failures with Argentina.\n\nAs in 2016, for the centenary Copa, the competition will take place in the United States with a format expanded to 16 teams, the ten usual South American competitors of Conmebol being joined by six members of Concacaf (North, Central America and the Caribbean).\n\nThe Copa and its 32 matches are like an aperitif before the World Cup 2026 and its 104 matches, including 78 in the United States. Eight stadiums are part of the system for the two competitions, including the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami and the MetLife Stadium in New York, future home of the World Cup final.\n\nThe American host, with a team in full doubt, lacks a priori arguments to compete with the great South American nations, despite the draw snatched against Brazil (1-1) last week in a preparation match.", "source":

Lionel Messi knows it is", "body": "Kylian Mbappe clearly ruffled some feathers last week when he suggested the European Championship was the world's most difficult international soccer competition.\n\n\"The Euros are complicated. For me, more complicated than a World Cup,\" the French national team captain said at a news conference before his team's first game.\n\nHold my beer, said former club teammate Lionel Messi, who led Argentina past France in an epic 2022 World Cup final, in which he and Mbappe -- who broke his nose in France's Euro-opening win over Austria on Monday -- combined for five of the game's six goals.\n\nSure the Euros, the quadrennial championship for FIFA's 55-member European confederation, is difficult. However, don't sleep on Copa Am\u00e9rica, the South American tournament expanded this year to include the U.S., Mexico and four other teams.\n\nRead more: How an amputee soccer team is helping Ukrainian soldiers overcome the trauma of war\n\n\"Well, everybody prioritizes their tournament,\" Messi fired back in a TV interview ahead of the Copa Am\u00e9rica opener Thursday between Argentina and Canada. \"The Euros is very important and has the best teams, but he's leaving out three-time champion Argentina, five-time champion Brazil, two-time champion Uruguay.\n\n\"There are a lot of world champions left off to say that it's the most difficult tournament.\"\n\nNot just world champions. In top-ranked Argentina and No. 5 Brazil, the Copa Am\u00e9rica field also has two of the top five teams in the latest FIFA world rankings. Colombia, which is also in the 16-team field, hasn't lost in 23 games over more than two years, the longest unbeaten streak in international soccer.\n\nA third of the 24 teams in the top-heavy Euro field are ranked outside the top 32.\n\nWith that as an introduction, here are four things to watch when the 48th Copa Am\u00e9rica kicks off at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta:\n\nThe South American championship is being played in the U.S. for the second time in eight years and eight of the 14 venues, including Inglewood's SoFi Stadium, also will play host to games in the 2026 World Cup. That makes the tournament an important trial run.\n\n\"We will always look at every event as a test for the next things that's coming up,\" said Otto Benedict, senior vice president for facility and campus operations at SoFi Stadium. \"Copa will allow us to have an international fan base that's coming through the building, so we're going to understand how those guests come, how they perceive the building.\"\n\nRead more: Emma Hayes won't let her USWNT coaching dream turn into a nightmare\n\nSoFi, which will stage eight games in the World Cup, will host two Copa group-stage matches: Brazil's tournament opener with Costa Rica on June 24 and Mexico's second game, with Venezuela, on June 26.\n\nBenedict said the stadium's Matrix Turf surface will be covered with a carpet of natural grass, a procedure that will be repeated for the World Cup, but the retractable bleachers in the corners will remain in place, leaving the pitch slightly narrower than FIFA will require for the World Cup.\n\n\"We're still going to have opportunities to learn,\" Benedict said. \"All those things are data points that will be collected.\"\n\nThe seven other Copa stadiums staging World Cup matches will conduct similar trials.\n\nThe 2026 World Cup will be a defining moment for the U.S., and the Copa might give an indication how the national team will be defined.\n\nIs the U.S. one of the world's top soccer-playing nations, as U.S. Soccer would like you to believe, or is it a pretender, a team that struggles against top competition and is undeserving of being ranked 11th -- ahead of Colombia, Germany and Uruguay -- in the latest FIFA rankings?\n\nAs a World Cup host, the U.S. -- along with co-hosts Mexico and Canada -- will not have to go through qualifying for 2026, making Copa the most challenging tournament it will face in the next two years.\n\nThe roster coach Gregg Berhalter will take into the team's opener against Bolivia at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on Saturday is collectively the best in USMNT history, with 23 of 26 players coming off major European clubs. Copa provides an important international stage on which to display those talents.\n\n\"It's a chance for us to show, before the World Cup, that we're a team to be feared,\" defender Chris Richards told reporters.\n\nNo U.S. manager who has coached more than seven games has a better winning percentage than Berhalter, but given the quality of the roster and the team's recent struggles -- the U.S. has won only two of its last six games -- he has come under fire. The protests grew louder after an especially poor showing in a 5-1 loss to Colombia earlier this month.\n\nThe Copa group stage, in which the U.S. will play Bolivia, Panama and Uruguay, offers a chance to flip that script. The three teams will present vastly different challenges, giving Berhalter a chance to show off his coaching chops with three different game plans.\n\nGetting out of group play is the bare minimum for the U.S., but matters will get a little tougher if it advances and probably will face either Colombia or Brazil in the quarterfinals.\n\nArgentina, the reigning World Cup champion and ranked No. 1 in the world, has lost only two of its last 57 games and has made the Copa Am\u00e9rica final a record 29 times, winning 15.\n\nAlthough the team led by the 36-year-old Messi has aged -- 11 players over 30 and the third-oldest roster in the tournament -- it appears to have a fairly comfortable path to a 30th final at Hard Rock Stadium in suburban Miami on July 14.\n\nWith Colombia and Brazil, Group D could be the toughest of the four four-team groups. Brazil, still without injured Neymar, needs to improve play after losing its last three games -- albeit to Uruguay, Colombia and Argentina -- in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying.", "source": {"uri":

After previously stating that the 2022 World Cup would be his last, Messi told Star+ in December that \"time will tell.\"\n\n\"As long as I feel I am well and that I am able to help, I will do it,\" Messi, who will turn 37 during the Copa Am\u00e9rica, said. \"Today, all I think about is to get well to the Copa Am\u00e9rica and play it. Fight for it again, as we always do, try to be the champions.\n\n\"If we do well at Copa Am\u00e9rica and I can keep playing, maybe it happens.\"\n\nBut Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni, who has overseen just four defeats in the team's last 50 games, had a message for Messi fans: Don't worry about the future, just enjoy the now.\n\n\"We Argentines are too melancholic and we are already thinking about the day when he is gone while he's still playing,\" Scaloni said last week. \"So let's enjoy him and we'll see what happens tomorrow. I think the present is so important for the whole world - not only for Argentina - because, in the end, Leo plays for everyone who likes football.\"\n\nOne player who will definitely be making his last tournament appearance for Argentina is \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda.\n\nThe 36-year-old has made 140 appearances for the national team and enjoys legendary status back home thanks to his winner in the final of the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica and a goal in the 2022 World Cup final.\n\nDi Mar\u00eda also won the U20 World Cup in 2007 and an Olympic gold medal at Beijing 2008.\n\nPreviously thought of as one of, if not the greatest football nation on earth, Brazil currently finds itself navigating a complicated transitional period.\n\nThe squad for the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica is largely inexperienced, with 15 players on less than 10 caps for their country. Only one player, West Ham's Lucas Paquet\u00e1, has reached 10 goals for Brazil, making the omissions of Casemiro and Richarlison all the more surprising.\n\nThe Sele\u00e7\u00e3o is still reeling from the absence of star man Neymar Jr., who ruptured his ACL playing for the national team in October. Brazil's all-time record goalscorer and a player with the ability to change a game in an instant, Neymar will be sorely missed for his contributions on the pitch, but also his leadership and status as an icon in an inexperienced dressing room.\n\nBrazil recently suffered back-to-back World Cup qualifier set-backs for the first time in its history, before going on to lose a third in a row. That third defeat - a 1-0 loss to Argentina at the Maracan\u00e3 - was historic, too, marking the first time Brazil had ever lost a home World Cup qualifier.\n\nInterim coach Fernando Diniz was sacked in January, less than halfway through his one-year deal, and replaced by journeyman manager Dorival J\u00fanior, who has so far overseen narrow wins against England and Mexico and draws against the USA and Spain.\n\nBut despite the team's recent struggles, the pressure and expectation will still be high back home - in particular with Vin\u00edcius Jr. leading the attack.\n\nThe Real Madrid forward has enjoyed a sensational season for Los Blancos, helping the team to a La Liga and Champions League double and making himself the favorite to win the Ballon d'Or.\n\nUruguay\n\nPerennial overachiever Uruguay once again goes into a Copa Am\u00e9rica among the favorites to win the title.\n\nThe nation of just 3.5 million people holds the joint record alongside Argentina for most Copa Am\u00e9rica titles won with 15.\n\nUnder new manager Marcelo Bielsa, who took charge in May 2023, a new, youthful Uruguay has made a tremendous start to World Cup qualifying, winning four of its six matches so far - including 2-0 wins over Brazil and Argentina - to sit second in the standings.\n\nWhile Bielsa has called up many inexperienced and uncapped players during his tenure so far to better implement his high intensity press, national team icon Luis Su\u00e1rez made the cut and will be supported by a talented cast that includes Jos\u00e9 Gim\u00e9nez, Ronald Ara\u00fajo and Federico Valverde.\n\nThe host\n\nThe USA enters the Copa Am\u00e9rica off the back of winning a third straight Nations League title, beating bitter rival Mexico 2-0 in the final less than two months ago.\n\nHowever, preparations for the tournament got off to the worst possible start with a 5-1 hammering at the hands of Colombia in Washington.\n\nAfter the defeat, goalkeeper Matt Turner said the team needed to \"bounce back in a big way,\" and a much-improved performance followed in a morale-boosting 1-1 draw against Brazil.\n\nDespite boasting several talented players, including Tim Weah, Christian Pulisic, Yunus Musah and Folarin Balogun, serious questions remain about whether the US men can consistently compete against teams outside of the weaker CONCACAF bubble.\n\nFortunately for the US, the group draw has been kind. First up is a weak Bolivia side which has endured an abysmal start to World Cup qualifying, losing five of its first six matches, before a clash against familiar CONCACAF opponent Panama.\n\nThe sternest test will come last against Uruguay, but Gregg Berhalter's side should have enough quality to at least advance to the knockout stages. Anything less could be a disaster as the team attempts to drum up support across the country ahead of a home World Cup.\n\nOnly a couple of months ago, you will likely have been hard pressed to find a Chile fan optimistic enough to predict that the team would make it past the group stages.\n\nThe failure to qualify for back-to-back World Cups in 2018 and 2022 has been a bitter pill to swallow for everyone involved after the country's 'Golden Generation' won successive Copa Am\u00e9ricas in 2015 and 2016 and reached the final of the 2017 Confederations Cup.\n\nSince Juan Antonio Pizzi was sacked as manager after the team missed out on Russia 2018, three successive coaches failed to get a tune out of the team - then Ricardo Gareca was hired.\n\nGareca, who impressively took Peru to the 2018 World Cup and the final of the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica, has had an immediate impact on the team since taking over in January, leading La Roja to comprehensive 3-0 wins over Paraguay and Albania and pushing France close in a 3-2 defeat in Marseille.\n\nBig names such as Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Claudio Bravo remain in the squad, but there is no place for Arturo Vidal or Gary Medel.\n\nIt might be a bit much to say expectations are now high, but fans are finally excited about watching La Roja playing again.\n\nColombia\n\nColombia arrives in the US as arguably the most in-form team in the tournament, if not the world.\n\nLos Cafeteros are currently on a 23-game unbeaten run that includes wins in their last eight matches. With three wins and three draws so far in World Cup qualifying, the team has soared to third place in the standings to put the failure of reaching Qatar 2022 behind it.\n\nLiverpool's Luis D\u00edaz will be Colombia's main man at the Copa Am\u00e9rica, supported by well-known veterans such as James Rodriguez, David Ospina and Yerry Mina.\n\nThe main issue for Colombia is its brutal potential route to the final, during which it will likely have to face Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

clinched his first international title at Copa America 2021, before he led La Albiceleste to World Cup glory in December 2022.\n\nAlthough he is set to turn 37, Messi still remains a key player for Lionel Scaloni's side and will be crucial to their hopes of winning a third consecutive major tournament.\n\nHere, Sports Mole takes a look at Messi's previous performances at the tournament, including his goal contributions and standout moments.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nCopa America 2007 - 2 goals, 1 assist\n\nThe little boy from Rosario made his Copa America debut in 2007 just a year after he made his first major tournament appearance at the 2006 World Cup.\n\nA 20-year-old Messi provided just an assist in the group stage, before he finally got on the scoresheet in Argentina's quarter-final demolition.\n\nMessi made an intelligent run inside to collect Rodrigo Riquelme's exquisite through ball and slot home his first-ever goal at the Copa America.\n\nHis finish in the quarter-final may have been regarded as a relatively simple one, but there was nothing ordinary about the sumptuous strike he produced in the last-four success against Mexico.\n\nWith Argentina a goal to the good, Messi picked up the ball on the right side of the box and opened up his body to conjure up an audacious lob that teased the outstretched Oswaldo Sanchez before nestling in the far corner.\n\nUnfortunately for Messi, his maiden Copa America ended in disappointment as Argentina slumped to a devastating 3-0 defeat to rivals Brazil in the final.\n\nCopa America 2011 - 0 goals, 3 assists\n\nAfter failing to trouble the scorers at the 2010 World Cup, Messi would have hoped to experience improved fortunes at the 2011 Copa America in Argentina.\n\nAs it proved, the attacker would endure another goalless tournament, although he did provide three assists in Argentina's four matches.\n\nHe also kept his composure to dispatch Argentina's first penalty in the quarter-final shootout against Uruguay, but Carlos Tevez failed to convert his spot-kick, ensuring La Albiceleste failed to reach the semi-finals for the first time since 1999.\n\nCopa America 2015 - 1 goal, 3 assists\n\nMessi participated in his second Copa America final in 2015 after helping Argentina progress through the group stage and oust Colombia and Paraguay in the knockout rounds.\n\nHe proved to be a thorn in Paraguay's side, scoring in the opening group game before providing three assists when the two nations met again in Argentina's 6-1 semi-final success.\n\nMessi scored his penalty in the quarter-final shootout against Colombia, and he repeated the feat in the final with Chile after the two countries had played out a goalless draw in Santiago.\n\nHowever, Gonzalo Higuain and Ever Banega were unable to follow Messi's lead as they fluffed their lines to hand Chile the trophy at their home tournament.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nCopa America 2016 - 4 goal, 4 assists\n\nJust a year later, Messi and Argentina experienced more penalty shootout heartbreak in another Copa America final against Chile.\n\nMessi sat out Argentina's opening group game with Chile due to a back problem, but he returned with a bang in their next fixture, netting his one and only hat-trick at a major tournament to fire his country to a 5-0 victory.\n\nThe Argentine magician then produced two phenomenal displays in the quarter-final and semi-final, registering a goal and two assists in both games against Venezuela and the USA.\n\nUnfortunately for Messi, those match-winning performances failed to translate into silverware as he and Lucas Biglia missed their penalties in the final shootout with Chile, leaving him to contemplate whether a major international honour would ever come his way.\n\nCopa America 2019 - 4 goals, 4 assists\n\nAfter having three years to reflect on the 2016 disappointment, Messi's return to the Copa America did not go according to plan as he mustered just one goal and one assist in the 2019 tournament.\n\nArgentina's hopes of winning the competition were quashed by a 2-0 semi-final defeat against Brazil, leaving Messi and his colleagues to fight over the third spot with Chile.\n\nMessi teed up Sergio Aguera for the opener in the third-place playoff, but his tournament ultimately ended with a rare red card after he was dismissed for his part in a confrontation with Gary Medel, who was also dismissed in a game that finished 2-1 in Argentina's favour.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nCopa America 2021 - 4 goals, 5 assists\n\nAs Messi entered another international tournament, there were certainly some doubts as to whether he would ever celebrate a title with Argentina after falling short in the 2014 World Cup final and three Copa America finals.\n\nHowever, all those years of anguish and frustration were finally laid to rest as Messi ended his long wait for international success in Brazil three years ago.\n\nMessi set out his stall with a goal and an assist in Argentina's opening two games, before he moved through the gears with a scintillating display in the final group game against Bolivia, setting up Papu Gomez for the opener before netting a brace to fire La Albiceleste to a 4-1 victory.\n\nThe former Barcelona star continued to lead from the front in the 3-0 quarter-final success over Ecuador, grabbing two assists and netting a trademark free-kick.\n\nMessi then registered an assist in the semi-final against Colombia, before he held his nerve to score in Argentina's penalty shootout success, setting up a mouthwatering final against bitter rivals Brazil.\n\nIt was perhaps fitting that 14 years after losing to Brazil in his first major international tournament final, the attacker finally got over the line against the same opponent thanks to Angel Di Maria's at the Maracana, generating the iconic scene of Messi's teammates running towards him as soon as the final whistle blew.\n\nIf there was one drawback to the 2021 triumph it was that the tournament was played behind closed doors due to COVID, so Messi may have that extra motivation to win the Copa America in front of his adoring faithful when he leads Argentina in the 2024 compettion.\n\nID:546129:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect9244:", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports

Eastern Time, Lionel Messi's Argentina will defend its title as the South American champion in the opening game of the Copa Am\u00e9rica, the longest-running international soccer tournament in the world. It won't take place, however, in any country south of the Dari\u00e9n jungle but in the Mercedes-Benz Stadium, in Atlanta, and Argentina's first opponent will be Canada. The United States, Mexico, Jamaica, Panama, and Costa Rica will also participate in this South American tournament, which will be held in Atlanta, East Rutherford, Orlando, Charlotte, Kansas City, Arlington, Houston, Austin, Glendale, Las Vegas, Inglewood, and Santa Clara. The final, on Sunday, July 14th, will be played in Miami Gardens.\n\nHow has it come to this? The first and most simple answer is that South America is in such a mess that it can no longer take care of its most precious tournament. It's not like the Copa has had a smooth history. Conceived as part of the centennial celebrations of Argentina's independence from Spain, in 1816, its first edition took place in Buenos Aires during two weeks in July of 1916, among only four teams -- Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Chile. Six more national teams were added in the following decades: Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela, covering almost all the continent. (Guyana and Suriname, the remaining South American nations, became and still are part of CONCACAF, the association that governs North American, Central American, and Caribbean teams, including the U.S. national team. All other South American teams belong to CONMEBOL.)\n\nDifferent crises have interrupted the Copa over the years. It was played annually until 1929, apart from 1918, owing to the flu pandemic, and 1928, when Argentina and Uruguay participated in the Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, instead. In 1930, Uruguay hosted the first-ever World Cup, defeating Argentina in the final; the subsequent beef between the two countries -- and the two leading teams -- prevented the Copa from being played for most of the following decade. Various reasons contributed to only six Copa Am\u00e9ricas being held in the nineteen-forties, six in the fifties, and just two in the sixties, among them a waning interest in some countries before broadcasting rights made the sport hugely profitable.\n\nIn the nineteen-eighties, it was decided that host countries would be appointed in alphabetical order. Argentina and Colombia were scheduled to co-host the Copa in 2020, but it was delayed owing to the COVID pandemic. The following year, the games in Colombia were suspended in the midst of widespread anti-government protests, and in Argentina, owing to health concerns. And then Brazil, which had hosted it in 2019, took over again. The final, won 1-0 by Messi's Argentina over his friend Neymar's Brazil, was played in an almost empty Maracan\u00e3 Stadium, in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThis year, it was Ecuador's turn to host. But, in November, 2022, the president of the Ecuadorian Football Federation, Francisco Egas, warned in a radio interview that \"we don't have the capacity to organize the Copa Am\u00e9rica.\" In fact, the nation was in an unprecedented crisis, the result of an especially devastating bout of the pandemic that led to the collapse of public services and brutal gang violence, which, at the beginning of this year, resulted in a declaration of national emergency. When Ecuador decided to pass, CONMEBOL and CONCACAF saw an opportunity to offer an expanded Copa Am\u00e9rica in the U.S. in anticipation of the 2026 World Cup, when the U.S. will be one of the host countries. They not only embraced the U.S. as the host of the Copa but changed the structure of the tournament to include six CONCACAF members.\n\n\"Why is Copa Am\u00e9rica played in the United States this year? Simple answer: money,\" Pablo Alabarces, a sociologist and the author of several books on soccer, including \"A Minimal History of Football in Latin America,\" told me. Oscar Barnade, the vice-president of the Argentinean Center for Research on the History of Football, concurred, saying that CONMEBOL's management has \"surrendered to the economic power of the U.S. and the M.L.S. (Major League Soccer).\"\n\nThe Copa had been hosted in the U.S. once before, in 2016, for a special celebration of its centennial. It took place a year into the FIFA corruption case, an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice which found that federation executives, including a number from CONMEBOL and CONCACAF, had received more than two hundred million dollars in bribes on marketing and broadcast deals. Despite that scandal, the Cup broke records of attendance with nearly 1.5 million spectators, giving a serious boost to the effort, several decades old, to make soccer a popular sport in the United States. More than a hundred million people watched the matches on Univision and Fox. (Broadcasting rights are core to the soccer business: they generated forty-five per cent of FIFA's revenue between 2019 and 2022, which totalled nearly $7.6 billion.)\n\nLast year, Messi, who had led Argentina to victory in both the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica and the 2022 World Cup, joined Inter Miami, an M.L.S. team. Apple TV+ had recently signed a $2.5-billion, ten-year deal to stream the league's games. The operation has been quite successful. After Messi joined Inter Miami, the club's value increased from six hundred million dollars to more than a billion. On the day he made his d\u00e9but, Apple TV+ saw a 1,690-per-cent increase in subscriptions to its M.L.S. Season Pass. Ticket prices for his first Inter Miami games increased by more than a thousand per cent in the secondary market. The club's Instagram account jumped from 1.1 million to 6.9 million followers immediately after Messi announced his decision; Messi now has more than five hundred million followers of his own. Celebrities have been flocking to see him play, including LeBron James, Serena Williams, Prince Harry, Kim Kardashian, Leonardo DiCaprio, Will Ferrell, and Selena Gomez. Earlier this year, Messi was named America's favorite professional athlete in a national poll conducted by Social Science Research Solutions; it was the first time a soccer player topped the list.\n\nRecent surveys by Gallup and Pew Research show that soccer, the most popular sport in the world, is now the fourth most popular in the U.S., behind football, baseball, and basketball. Additionally, it has a more diverse and younger fan base than other major sports. It is the favorite sport among Latinos, a population of more than sixty-three million people and growing; if U.S Latinos were a country, it would be the third-largest in Latin America, after Brazil and Mexico. Not surprisingly, most of the Copa Am\u00e9rica matches will be played in cities with significant Latino populations.\n\nBeyond the conquest of this tantalizing American market, the transformation of the Copa Am\u00e9rica from a purely South American tournament into a transcontinental one fits perfectly with a global, twenty-first-century trend: the transnationalization of the sport that Americans know as soccer and the rest of the world knows as football. These days, major European teams routinely tour the U.S., Asia, and Australia in the pre-season; players from the Global South are sold as soon as they are turned out by local academies to European clubs owned not only by millionaires from around the world but even by state proxies, as in the case of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. You can even follow the adventures of two Hollywood actors buying an old and failing club in a small town in Wales and turning it into a global sensation.", "source": {"uri": "newyorker.com",

The 108-year-old competition is being held in the United States with the host nation among six teams from the CONCACAF region joining the 10 South American nations looking for a place in the July 14 final in Miami. While FIFA will be looking closely at the organization of the event, two years out from the World Cup which will be co-hosted by the USA, Canada and Mexico, the tournament's rich history and prestige means it is much, much more than a 'trial event'.\n\nArgentina have won the Copa 15 times but only once, in 2021, during the Messi era and coach Lionel Scaloni has stuck largely with his World Cup-winning squad, with veterans Angel Di Maria and Nicolas Otamendi likely taking their final bow in a major tournament.\n\nWhether this is Messi's goodbye to elite international football is yet to be found out - the eight-times Ballon d'Or winner, now playing in Major League Soccer with Inter Miami, will turn 37 four days after Thursday's opener in Atlanta against Canada and has yet to decide whether he will try to play in a record sixth World Cup.\n\n\"It's great to have records and continue to achieve things but I won't take part in a World Cup just to say I've done six,\" Messi told ESPN last week.\n\n\"If I feel good and everything is in place for me to be there, fine, but I won't go just to go. It's very difficult to imagine what can happen because it's still two years away. I don't need to commit right now to whether or not I'll be there,\" he added.\n\nWhat is certain is that Messi, who has managed his workload to try to be in peak condition for the tournament, would relish the chance to win a third straight major tournament with his country after so many years of frustration with his national team.\n\nAfter facing Canada, Argentina take on Chile in New Jersey before finishing their group A action against Peru in Miami but they know that tough opposition awaits in the knock-out stage with rivals Brazil and Uruguay the two expected challengers for the title.\n\nBrazil have struggled in CONMEBOL qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup having won just two of their opening six games and they currently sit in sixth place in the standings having lost to Uruguay, Colombia and Argentina.\n\nThe pressure will be on the Real Madrid attacking pair of Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo to translate their club form into success for the Selecao while there is much excitement around the senior tournament debut of 17-year-old talent Endrick, who is set to join Real next month from Palmeiras.\n\nUruguay, also 15-times winners, have impressed under their 68-year-old Argentina coach Marcelo Bielsa, who has brought his trademark high-energy style to the team and raised expectations with recent wins over Argentina and Brazil.\n\nColombia head into the tournament without a loss in over two years and with Liverpool's livewire winger Luis Diaz a constant threat and James Rodriguez enjoying a late career revival, Nestor Lorenzo's team can't be discounted.\n\nThe USA will hope that they can generate some sorely needed excitement after losing their way since a creditable run to the last-16 at the World Cup.\n\nCoach Gregg Berhalter is under some pressure to show he can get his team, which relies on the smart wing play of Christian Pulisic, to compete with teams from outside of CONCACAF.\n\nMexico have guested frequently in the Copa in the past and reached the final in 1993 and 2001, but they look well below their usual level although they can, as always, count on huge support in the USA.\n\nThis is the second time the Copa America is being held in the USA, after the Centenary tournament in 2016, and while that is a break with tradition the presence of significant immigrant communities from all the competing nations, should ensure big crowds at the mostly NFL stadiums being used.", "source": {"uri": "sports.ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTVSports.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

And if you aren't one already, it's the perfect time to jump onboard.\n\n\"Don't let anybody tell you that we're not a soccer nation. Don't let anybody tell that we don't have a soccer culture,\" FOX analyst and former U.S. men's national team standout Alexi Lalas told USA TODAY Sports. \"It's different. It is unique and it is uniquely American. And that's something I think we should lean into and celebrate.\"\n\nCONMEBOL Copa Am\u00e9rica, or the American cup, is the world's oldest running continental tournament, dating to 1916. It is used to determine the champion of South America, but select teams from North America and Asia have been invited to compete since the 1990s. This year, the 10 CONMEBOL teams will be joined by six Concacaf teams.\n\nThis summer's edition will be the 48 tournament and only the second time it has ever been held outside of South America. The United States also hosted Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario in 2016, a special edition of the tournament to commemorate 100 years of CONMEBOL and Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\nThe tournament is now held every four years, coinciding with the UEFA European Championship.\n\nDefending champions Argentina and Uruguay have won Copa Am\u00e9rica 15 times each, most of any country followed by Brazil (nine, last in 2019).\n\nThe tournament will be held in 14 cities across the U.S., with each location hosting two or three matches over a 25-day period. The opening match is Thursday in Atlanta and the final is July 14 in Miami. The third-place match will be in Charlotte July 13.\n\nMatches will also be played at stadiums in Arizona (Glendale); California (Santa Clara and Inglewood); Florida (Orlando and Miami); Kansas and Missouri (in Kansas City); Nevada (Las Vegas); New Jersey (East Rutherford) and Texas (Arlington, Austin and Houston).\n\nMore than 1 million tickets have been sold for 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica games, according to CONMEBOL. Tickets can be purchased at copamerica.com and other ticketing platforms.\n\nCOPA AMERICA TICKETS: Experience Copa America 2024 in person\n\nHere's the Copa Am\u00e9rica schedule for group play (June 20-July 2), round of 16 (July 4-6), semifinals (July 9 and 10), third-place (July 13) and final (July 14).\n\nBefore the 8 p.m. ET kickoff of Argentina vs. Canada at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, fans will get a show for the opening ceremony of Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\nColombian musician Feid is the opening act. He is a nine-time Latin Grammy nominee.\n\nThe U.S. men's national team begins play in Group C against Bolivia on Sunday, then Panama on June 27 and Uruguay July 1.\n\nDuring friendlies to prepare for the tournament, the U.S. played Brazil to a 1-1 draw last Wednesday, rebounding from a disappointing 5-1 defeat to Colombia.\n\nThe Americans' best Copa Am\u00e9rica finish has been fourth place, losing the third-place game in 1995 and 2016.\n\nFOX analyst Alexi Lalas says: \"I think Gregg Berhalter, the head coach, is under pressure to provide one of those seminal types of moments, and to do things that haven't been done in the past. And this group, we have put them on this pedestal, and I think fairly so because we expect them to do things that we haven't seen in the past and that people don't think can be done. And I don't think that that's unfair. But it's up to them to believe that they can do it.\"\n\nMessi and Argentina are the defending Copa Am\u00e9rica 2021 and World Cup 2022 champions, and the favorites to win this summer's Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\nMessi, the star of Inter Miami in Major League Soccer, turns 37 on June 24. He's still among the best players in the world, despite nearing the end of his illustrious career. And his participation in Copa Am\u00e9rica is a critical moment for the sport in the United States, which will host the FIFA Club World Cup in 2025 and World Cup 2026.\n\nArgentina (+175) is the betting favorite to win Copa Am\u00e9rica, while the United States is tied among three teams with the fourth-best odds to win, according to BETMGM.\n\nHere's the next Top 5: Brazil (+225), Uruguay (+500), while Colombia, Mexico and the U.S. have +1200 odds.\n\nArgentina and Brazil (+225) are the oddsmakers' favorites to reach the Copa Am\u00e9rica final, to be played at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla. on July 14.\n\nThere will be 41 Major League Soccer players (including one MLS Next Pro player) in Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\nUnited States: Sean Johnson (GK, Toronto FC), Shaq Moore

The historic 108-year-old competition is being held in the United States, featuring six CONCACAF teams joining the ten South American nations vying for a spot in the July 14 final in Miami. While FIFA will closely observe the event's organization ahead of the 2026 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the USA, Canada, and Mexico, the Copa America's rich history and prestige make it far more than just a 'trial event'.\n\nArgentina has claimed the Copa America 15 times, but only once during Messi's era, in 2021. Coach Lionel Scaloni has largely retained the World Cup-winning squad, with veterans Angel Di Maria and Nicolas Otamendi likely participating in their final major tournament.\n\nWhether this will be Messi's farewell to elite international football remains uncertain. The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner, now playing in Major League Soccer with Inter Miami, will turn 37 four days after Thursday's opener in Atlanta against Canada and has yet to decide if he will pursue a record sixth World Cup appearance.\n\n\"It's great to have records and continue to achieve things, but I won't take part in a World Cup just to say I've done six,\" Messi told ESPN last week. \"If I feel good and everything is in place for me to be there, fine, but I won't go just to go. It's very difficult to imagine what can happen because it's still two years away. I don't need to commit right now to whether or not I'll be there,\" he added.\n\nOne thing is certain: Messi, who has managed his workload to be in peak condition for the tournament, would cherish the chance to win a third consecutive major title with his country after years of frustration with the national team.\n\nTough Opposition\n\nAfter facing Canada, Argentina will play against Chile in New Jersey and then finish their group stage matches against Peru in Miami. They are aware that tough opposition awaits in the knockout stage, with Brazil and Uruguay expected to be the main challengers for the title.\n\nBrazil has struggled in CONMEBOL qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup, winning only two of their first six games and currently sitting in sixth place after losses to Uruguay, Colombia, and Argentina.\n\nSeveral familiar names are absent from Dorival Junior's Brazil squad, including Casemiro, Gabriel Jesus, and Thiago Silva, while Richarlison and Neymar are out due to injuries. The pressure will be on Real Madrid's attacking duo, Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo, to replicate their club success for the national team. There is also much excitement around 17-year-old talent Endrick, set to join Real Madrid next month from Palmeiras, making his senior tournament debut.\n\nUruguay, also 15-time winners, has impressed under their 68-year-old Argentine coach Marcelo Bielsa, who has instilled his high-energy style into the team, raising expectations with recent wins over Argentina and Brazil. Liverpool forward Darwin Nunez will lead the line, although Bielsa can call on veteran Luis Suarez from the bench.\n\nColombia enters the tournament unbeaten in over two years, with Liverpool's dynamic winger Luis Diaz and James Rodriguez, who is experiencing a late-career revival, making Nestor Lorenzo's team a formidable opponent.\n\nThe USA hopes to generate excitement after losing momentum since their last-16 finish at the World Cup. Coach Gregg Berhalter is under pressure to prove that his team, relying on the smart wing play of Christian Pulisic, can compete with teams outside of CONCACAF.\n\nMexico, frequent guests at the Copa America, reached the final in 1993 and 2001, but currently look below their usual level. However, they can always count on massive support in the USA.\n\nThis is the second time the Copa America is being held in the USA, following the Centenary tournament in 2016. Despite breaking tradition, the presence of significant immigrant communities from all competing nations should ensure large crowds at the NFL stadiums being used.", "source": {"uri":

Kickoff from Atlanta is at 8 p.m. Eastern on FS1.\n\nSeveral streaming services will broadcast the game live, and you can watch on Fubo (free trial), DirecTV Stream (free trial) and Sling (promotional offers).\n\nThe 36-year-old Messi highlights an Argentina squad that includes Premier League stars Enzo Fernandez and Alexis Mac Allister among many other key players.\n\nFor Canada, it will be the first match with new coach Jesse Marsch in charge.

He is either tied for second with Ali Daei or one behind, depending on whether a disputed goal by the Iranian is counted, trailing only Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo at 128.\n\n\"It is not easy to compete again after winning it all,\" Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said.\n\nArgentina and Uruguay are tied with 15 Copa titles each, followed by Brazil with nine. No other nation has won more than two.\n\nBrazil features an attack headed by Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior and Rodrygo, just off a Champions League title with Real Madrid, and Raphinha.

Stay up to speed on what's happening in sports by subscribing here.\n\nWhat a time for soccer fans. With the men's European Championship underway in Germany and the Olympic tournaments in Paris just five weeks away, another big international event kicks off on Thursday night in Atlanta as Canada faces World Cup champion Argentina in the Copa America opener.\n\nHere are a few key things to know about the Copa and what it means for Canada:\n\nThis is South America's version of the European Championship.\n\nIt's not as large, as deep or as widely celebrated as the 24-team Euro, which includes eight of the world's top 10 teams. But the Copa features No. 1 ranked Argentina (the reigning Copa and World Cup champion) and No. 5 Brazil (winner of a record five World Cups) among its 16 entries. The other top South American countries in the tournament are 12th-ranked Colombia and No. 15 Uruguay, along with Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Venezuela, Paraguay and Bolivia (all ranked outside the top 30).\n\nWith the United States hosting this year, six teams from the CONCACAF confederation (North and Central America and the Caribbean) were invited to play. The top qualifiers from the region are the 11th-ranked United States and No. 15 Mexico. They're joined by Canada, ranked 49th, and Panama, Costa Rica and Jamaica (all ranked between 45th and 55th).\n\nThe teams are divided into four groups of four for round-robin play in various U.S. cities, with the top two in each group advancing to the quarterfinals starting July 4 in Texas, Arizona and Las Vegas. The semifinals are July 9 and 10 in New Jersey and North Carolina, and the final takes place July 14 in Miami.\n\nLionel Messi is nearing the end.\n\nIn the 2021 Copa final, Messi captained Argentina to a 1-0 win over rival Brazil at famed Maracana Stadium in Rio, giving La Albiceleste their first South American title since 1993 and Messi the first senior international trophy of his career. The following year in Qatar, Messi led Argentina to its first World Cup title since Diego Maradona's iconic Hand of God-assisted victory in 1986.\n\nNow that Messi has silenced (at least some of) his Maradona-worshipping critics in Argentina, there's speculation that the Copa could be the final international tournament for the almost-37-year-old superstar. But with the 2026 World Cup taking place mostly in the United States, and Messi still playing brilliantly for Inter Miami of U.S.-based Major League Soccer (he has 12 goals in 12 games this season) it seems like there's a good chance he'll stick around.\n\nBrazil is trying to regain continental supremacy.\n\nAn Argentina-Brazil rematch is expected for the final. Messi's team is the slight betting favourite to win the title over the Brazilians, who have fallen on tough times by their lofty standards. The Selecao's last World Cup title came more than two decades ago, in 2002, and they were eliminated in the quarterfinals in four of the five World Cups since then, including the last two.\n\nNeymar, who last year overtook Pel\u00e9 to become Brazil's all-time leading men's scorer, is out with a knee injury. But Brazil still has plenty of stars at the Copa, including Champions League MVP Vinicius Junior, his Real Madrid teammate Rodrygo and 17-year-old phenom Endrick, who already has three goals in six matches for the senior national team and is about to join the others on Real Madrid.\n\nThis is a big test for Canada.\n\nQualifying for the Copa for the first time gave the Canadian men's team a valuable opportunity to face quality opponents from outside their region in a high-pressure environment as they prepare for the 2026 World Cup, which Canada is co-hosting with the U.S. and Mexico. But they nearly blew it, losing a home-and-home qualifier against Jamaica in November after taking a two-goal lead into the final half.\n\nThe Canadians ducked into the Copa by defeating 98th-ranked Trinidad and Tobago in a last-chance play-in game in March. They later replaced interim head coach Mauro Biello with Jesse Marsch, a 50-year-old American who has guided teams in the English Premier League, the German Bundesliga and Major League Soccer. Biello filled the role after John Herdman left for Toronto FC after guiding Canada to its first World Cup appearance in 36 years.\n\nMarsch's results since taking over last month have been mixed. His team got outclassed 4-0 by the seventh-ranked Netherlands on June 7 before battling No. 2 France to a scoreless draw in another away friendly three days later.\n\nFor his first tournament in charge of Canada, Marsch named 23-year-old Alphonso Davies as team captain. The Bayern Munich star replaces Atiba Hutchinson, who retired last year with a Canadian men's record 104 appearances. Vice captain Stephen Eustaquio (FC Porto), Jonathan David (Lille) and Tajon Buchanan (Inter Milan) are also among the holdovers from the 2022 World Cup, where Canada lost all three of its matches and scored just one goal. Marsch was forced to make a late change on Sunday, replacing injured winger Junior Hoilett with Joel Waterman. Read more about the Canadian roster here.\n\nAfter their date with Messi's Argentina on Thursday at 8 p.m. ET in Atlanta, Canada will play 32nd-ranked Peru on June 25 at 6 p.m. ET in Kansas City and No. 42 Chile on June 29 at 8 p.m. ET in Orlando.\n\nAs the lowest-ranked team in Group A, Canada is not expected to advance. The betting markets give them only about a 30 per cent chance of placing in the top two, putting them well behind Argentina (above 90 per cent) and Chile (above 50 per cent) but slightly ahead of Peru (about 27 per cent). \"We know it's a big challenge,\" Marsch said.

Messi and Argentina will try to win their third straight major title when they defend their Copa America championship while Brazil hopes 17-year-old Endrick will combine with Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior and Rodrygo for success.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Lionel Messi and Argentina will try to match Spain's feat of three consecutive major titles when the Copa America kicks off Thursday night.\n\nComing off championships in the 2021 Copa America and the 2022 World Cup, Messi will be four days shy of his 37th birthday when the Albiceleste take the field against Canada at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.\n\n\"I want to enjoy a couple of more matches being a world champion,\" Messi said after Argentina beat France on penalty kicks to win the 2022 World Cup final.\n\nHe has 10 goals in 10 international appearances since, raising his total to 108 in 182 games for Argentina's national team. He is either tied for second with Ali Daei or one behind, depending on whether a disputed goal by the Iranian is counted, trailing only Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo at 128.\n\n\"It is not easy to compete again after winning it all,\" Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said.\n\nArgentina and Uruguay are tied with 15 Copa titles each, followed by Brazil with nine. No other nation has won more than two.\n\nBrazil features an attack headed by Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior and Rodrygo, just off a Champions League title with Real Madrid, and Raphinha. The emerging star is 17-year-old Endrick, who joins Real Madrid this summer.\n\n\"If you look at every position in their proposed starting 11, it's probably one of the world's best players,\" U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter said.\n\nSpain is the only nation to win three consecutive major titles: the European Championship in 2008 and 2012 around the 2010 World Cup.\n\nA look at the tournament:\n\nExpanded field\n\nThere will be 16 teams, just as in 2016. The U.S., Mexico, Canada, Costa Rica, Panama and Jamaica join the 10 South American nations after qualifying from North and Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nBack in the USA\n\nEcuador was to host the tournament under the rotation of CONMEBOL, South American soccer's governing body, but declined. The tournament was then moved to the U.S., which also hosted the special centennial Copa America in 2016 as Chile won on penalty kicks over Argentina at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\nEleven NFL stadiums are being used, including eight of the 11 U.S. venues for the 2026 World Cup, plus three smaller MLS homes. The final will be at Miami Gardens, Florida, on July 14, starting five hours after the European Championship final in Berlin.\n\nCONMEBOL says more than 1 million tickets have been sold for the 32 matches. The 2016 tournament drew just under 1.5 million, and the 2019 tournament in Brazil about 850,000. The 2021 Copa was played mostly without fans because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nU.S. team\n\nThis will be the biggest test for the U.S. team before the World Cup -- the Americans get an automatic berth as co-host along with Mexico and Canada -- and most Europe-based players are expected to skip next year's CONCACAF Gold Cup.\n\nChristian Pulisic, Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie are the core of a team that returns 18 players from the 2022 World Cup roster.\n\n\"A World Cup on home soil is the biggest thing that you know we'll probably do in our career,\" Pulisic said. \"It's a special time for this sport in America.\"\n\nWorld Cup test?\n\nIn 2016, CONMEBOL partnered with the U.S. Soccer Federation, which was in charge of most of the logistics. This time, CONMEBOL is co-organizing the tournament with CONCACAF, the governing body of North and Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nUnlike during the World Cup, the organizers have only short-term access to venues. At Hard Rock, a concert is scheduled for July 6, between the last group stage game and the final, and a new grass surface will be installed.\n\nAt MetLife Stadium, where a semifinal will be played July 9, staff will look at it as a preview for the World Cup final on July 19, 2026. The stadium has a camera system designed by Arecont Vision and managed by Genetec Security Center that was installed before the 2014 Super Bowl and a new system by Axis Communications is being put in place this summer in the seating bowl with 80 8K, 41-megapixel cameras.\n\n\"We can see every seat all the time. I think it serves as a good deterrent,\" said Daniel DeLorenzi, vice president of security and safety services. \"We have three drone detection systems. ... Not only can we track the drone, but more importantly, we can track where the operator is.\"\n\nAP sports: https://apnews.com/sports", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news",

After previously stating that the 2022 World Cup would be his last, Messi told Star+ in December that \"time will tell.\"\n\n\"As long as I feel I am well and that I am able to help, I will do it,\" Messi, who will turn 37 during the Copa Am\u00e9rica, said. \"Today, all I think about is to get well to the Copa Am\u00e9rica and play it. Fight for it again, as we always do, try to be the champions.\n\n\"If we do well at Copa Am\u00e9rica and I can keep playing, maybe it happens.\"\n\nBut Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni, who has overseen just four defeats in the team's last 50 games, had a message for Messi fans: Don't worry about the future, just enjoy the now.\n\n\"We Argentines are too melancholic and we are already thinking about the day when he is gone while he's still playing,\" Scaloni said last week. \"So let's enjoy him and we'll see what happens tomorrow. I think the present is so important for the whole world - not only for Argentina - because, in the end, Leo plays for everyone who likes football.\"\n\nOne player who will definitely be making his last tournament appearance for Argentina is \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda.\n\nThe 36-year-old has made 140 appearances for the national team and enjoys legendary status back home thanks to his winner in the final of the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica and a goal in the 2022 World Cup final.\n\nDi Mar\u00eda also won the U20 World Cup in 2007 and an Olympic gold medal at Beijing 2008.\n\nBrazil\n\nPreviously thought of as one of, if not the greatest football nation on earth, Brazil currently finds itself navigating a complicated transitional period.\n\nThe squad for the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica is largely inexperienced, with 15 players on less than 10 caps for their country. Only one player, West Ham's Lucas Paquet\u00e1, has reached 10 goals for Brazil, making the omissions of Casemiro and Richarlison all the more surprising.\n\nThe Sele\u00e7\u00e3o is still reeling from the absence of star man Neymar Jr., who ruptured his ACL playing for the national team in October. Brazil's all-time record goalscorer and a player with the ability to change a game in an instant, Neymar will be sorely missed for his contributions on the pitch, but also his leadership and status as an icon in an inexperienced dressing room.\n\nBrazil recently suffered back-to-back World Cup qualifier set-backs for the first time in its history, before going on to lose a third in a row. That third defeat - a 1-0 loss to Argentina at the Maracan\u00e3 - was historic, too, marking the first time Brazil had ever lost a home World Cup qualifier.\n\nInterim coach Fernando Diniz was sacked in January, less than halfway through his one-year deal, and replaced by journeyman manager Dorival J\u00fanior, who has so far overseen narrow wins against England and Mexico and draws against the USA and Spain.\n\nBut despite the team's recent struggles, the pressure and expectation will still be high back home - in particular with Vin\u00edcius Jr. leading the attack.\n\nThe Real Madrid forward has enjoyed a sensational season for Los Blancos, helping the team to a La Liga and Champions League double and making himself the favorite to win the Ballon d'Or.\n\nUruguay\n\nPerennial overachiever Uruguay once again goes into a Copa Am\u00e9rica among the favorites to win the title.\n\nThe nation of just 3.5 million people holds the joint record alongside Argentina for most Copa Am\u00e9rica titles won with 15.\n\nUnder new manager Marcelo Bielsa, who took charge in May 2023, a new, youthful Uruguay has made a tremendous start to World Cup qualifying, winning four of its six matches so far - including 2-0 wins over Brazil and Argentina - to sit second in the standings.\n\nWhile Bielsa has called up many inexperienced and uncapped players during his tenure so far to better implement his high intensity press, national team icon Luis Su\u00e1rez made the cut and will be supported by a talented cast that includes Jos\u00e9 Gim\u00e9nez, Ronald Ara\u00fajo and Federico Valverde.\n\nThe USA enters the Copa Am\u00e9rica off the back of winning a third straight Nations League title, beating bitter rival Mexico 2-0 in the final less than two months ago.\n\nHowever, preparations for the tournament got off to the worst possible start with a 5-1 hammering at the hands of Colombia in Washington.\n\nAfter the defeat, goalkeeper Matt Turner said the team needed to \"bounce back in a big way,\" and a much-improved performance followed in a morale-boosting 1-1 draw against Brazil.\n\nDespite boasting several talented players, including Tim Weah, Christian Pulisic, Yunus Musah and Folarin Balogun, serious questions remain about whether the US men can consistently compete against teams outside of the weaker CONCACAF bubble.\n\nFortunately for the US, the group draw has been kind. First up is a weak Bolivia side which has endured an abysmal start to World Cup qualifying, losing five of its first six matches, before a clash against familiar CONCACAF opponent Panama.\n\nThe sternest test will come last against Uruguay, but Gregg Berhalter's side should have enough quality to at least advance to the knockout stages. Anything less could be a disaster as the team attempts to drum up support across the country ahead of a home World Cup.\n\nChile\n\nOnly a couple of months ago, you will likely have been hard pressed to find a Chile fan optimistic enough to predict that the team would make it past the group stages.\n\nThe failure to qualify for back-to-back World Cups in 2018 and 2022 has been a bitter pill to swallow for everyone involved after the country's 'Golden Generation' won successive Copa Am\u00e9ricas in 2015 and 2016 and reached the final of the 2017 Confederations Cup.\n\nSince Juan Antonio Pizzi was sacked as manager after the team missed out on Russia 2018, three successive coaches failed to get a tune out of the team - then Ricardo Gareca was hired.\n\nGareca, who impressively took Peru to the 2018 World Cup and the final of the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica, has had an immediate impact on the team since taking over in January, leading La Roja to comprehensive 3-0 wins over Paraguay and Albania and pushing France close in a 3-2 defeat in Marseille.\n\nBig names such as Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Claudio Bravo remain in the squad, but there is no place for Arturo Vidal or Gary Medel.\n\nIt might be a bit much to say expectations are now high, but fans are finally excited about watching La Roja playing again.\n\nColombia\n\nColombia arrives in the US as arguably the most in-form team in the tournament, if not the world.\n\nLos Cafeteros are currently on a 23-game unbeaten run that includes wins in their last eight matches. With three wins and three draws so far in World Cup qualifying, the team has soared to third place in the standings to put the failure of reaching Qatar 2022 behind it.\n\nLiverpool's Luis D\u00edaz will be Colombia's main man at the Copa Am\u00e9rica, supported by well-known veterans such as James Rodriguez, David Ospina and Yerry Mina.\n\nThe main issue for Colombia is its brutal potential route to the final, during which it will likely have to face Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors":

Messi and Argentina will try to win their third straight major title when they defend their Copa America championship. Bruna Prado/Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK -- Lionel Messi and Argentina will try to match Spain's feat of three consecutive major titles when the Copa America kicks off Thursday night.\n\nComing off championships in the 2021 Copa America and the 2022 World Cup, Messi will be four days shy of his 37th birthday when the Albiceleste take the field against Canada at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.\n\n\"I want to enjoy a couple of more matches being a world champion,\" Messi said after Argentina beat France on penalty kicks to win the 2022 World Cup final.\n\nHe has 10 goals in 10 international appearances since, raising his total to 108 in 182 games for Argentina's national team. He is either tied for second with Ali Daei or one behind, depending on whether a disputed goal by the Iranian is counted, trailing only Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo at 128.\n\n\"It is not easy to compete again after winning it all,\" Argentina Coach Lionel Scaloni said.\n\nArgentina and Uruguay are tied with 15 Copa titles each, followed by Brazil with nine. No other nation has won more than two.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrazil features an attack headed by Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior and Rodrygo, just off a Champions League title with Real Madrid, and Raphinha. The emerging star is 17-year-old Endrick, who joins Real Madrid this summer.\n\n\"If you look at every position in their proposed starting 11, it's probably one of the world's best players,\" U.S. Coach Gregg Berhalter said.\n\nSpain is the only nation to win three consecutive major titles: the European Championship in 2008 and 2012 around the 2010 World Cup.\n\nA look at the tournament:\n\nEXPANDED FIELD\n\nThere will be 16 teams, just as in 2016. The U.S., Mexico, Canada, Costa Rica, Panama and Jamaica join the 10 South American nations after qualifying from North and Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBACK IN THE USA\n\nEcuador was to host the tournament under the rotation of CONMEBOL, South American soccer's governing body, but declined. The tournament was then moved to the U.S., which also hosted the special centennial Copa America in 2016 as Chile won on penalty kicks over Argentina at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\nEleven NFL stadiums are being used, including eight of the 11 U.S. venues for the 2026 World Cup, plus three smaller MLS homes. The final will be at Miami Gardens, Florida, on July 14, starting five hours after the European Championship final in Berlin.\n\nCONMEBOL says more than 1 million tickets have been sold for the 32 matches. The 2016 tournament drew just under 1.5 million, and the 2019 tournament in Brazil about 850,000. The 2021 Copa was played mostly without fans because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nU.S. TEAM\n\nThis will be the biggest test for the U.S. team before the World Cup - the Americans get an automatic berth as co-host along with Mexico and Canada - and most Europe-based players are expected to skip next year's CONCACAF Gold Cup.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristian Pulisic, Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie are the core of a team that returns 18 players from the 2022 World Cup roster.\n\n\"A World Cup on home soil is the biggest thing that you know we'll probably do in our career,\" Pulisic said. \"It's a special time for this sport in America.\"\n\nWORLD CUP TEST\n\nIn 2016, CONMEBOL partnered with the U.S. Soccer Federation, which was in charge of most of the logistics. This time, CONMEBOL is co-organizing the tournament with CONCACAF, the governing body of North and Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nUnlike during the World Cup, the organizers have only short-term access to venues. At Hard Rock, a concert is scheduled for July 6, between the last group stage game and the final, and a new grass surface will be installed.\n\nAt MetLife Stadium, where a semifinal will be played July 9, staff will look at it as a preview for the World Cup final on July 19, 2026. The stadium has a camera system designed by Arecont Vision and managed by Genetec Security Center that was installed before the 2014 Super Bowl and a new system by Axis Communications is being put in place this summer in the seating bowl with 80 8K, 41-megapixel cameras.\n\n\"We can see every seat all the time. I think it serves as a good deterrent,\" said Daniel DeLorenzi, vice president of security and safety services. \"We have three drone detection systems. ... Not only can we track the drone, but more importantly, we can track where the operator is.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Messi won the title thanks to his greater number of assists.\n\nNo player has scored over six goals, and won the award, since Adriano netted seven for Brazil in 2004.\n\nThe Golden Boot award is always a key battle in the Copa America.\n\nLionel Messi is set to move up the all-time list in the USA this summer.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrygo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rodrygo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sporting_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sporting News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_D\u00edaz_(footballer,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis D\u00edaz (footballer, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriano_(footballer,_born_February_1982)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adriano (footballer, born February 1982)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin\u00edcius_J\u00fanior", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zizinho", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zizinho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Petanque", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Petanque", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-06/nba-canada--88f2d012-47a4-482a-a281-5267889cfacd.jpeg?itok=nmRt7r2B", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658543", "eventUri": "eng-9658543", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 1121, "textEnd": 1128}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-14", "textStart": 1153, "textEnd": 1160}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-06-", "textStart": 2086, "textEnd": 2093}], "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The news and editorial departments had no role in the creation or display of this content.\n\nOn the heels of a statement 1-1 international friendly draw against Brazil, the U.S. Men's National Team heads into the CONMEBOL Copa America looking to put the world on notice.\n\nBelow, we dig into United States Copa America odds and preview some of the markets being offered for Team USA at DraftKings, BetMGM & more:\n\nSoccer sportsbook bonuses: Top Copa America 2024 betting sites, apps & offers\n\nREAD: Copa America odds, preview & picksREAD: Argentina, Lionel Messi odds for Copa America\n\n2024 Copa America United States Odds & Preview: Argentina Favored to repeat with USA as dark horse\n\nFIFA world No. 1 Argentina has racked up the silverware of late. As the 2022 World Cup champions and defending Copa America winners, Lionel Messi and Argentina certainly appear poised to put on another top-tier performance. The odds-on favorites to hoist the Copa America trophy at +175, but the USMNT can't be counted out.\n\nSitting at No. 11 in the FIFA World Rankings, the United States Men's National Team enter Copa America determined to make a deep run. By snapping its 11-game losing streak against Brazil last week, the USMNT gained some much-needed confidence ahead of the tournament kickoff.\n\nThe U.S. sits at +1400 to win the CONMEBOL Copa America and depending on the sportsbook, near or equal to archrival Mexico.\n\nCopa America picks for USMNT & more\n\nIf you comb through the top Copa America sportsbook apps including BetMGM, DraftKings and others, you will find plenty of options surrounding the United States.\n\nOf course, there are odds to win Copa America but sportsbooks also include odds to win and qualify from Group C, individual player and team props and betting lines for each game.\n\nBelow are our favorite United States Copa America picks:\n\nUSA Copa America Best Bets: USMNT to win Group C (+140 or better)\n\nThe United States is planted closely behind Uruguay (-145) when it comes to winning the group. These two don't meet up until the third group stage game, so there's plenty to play out beforehand.\n\nThe USA must beat Bolivia in their opening match Sunday (6 p.m. ET) and get another result from Panama (June 27, 6 p.m.) to give themselves a realistic shot at the group, but it's entirely possible to cash this plus-money bet and it provides a rooting interest over multiple matches.\n\nCopa America USA best bets: Christian Pulisic top USA goal scorer (+380 or better)\n\nUSA wunderkind Christian Pulisic is eager to show why he should have been called up for the 2023 Gold Cup.\n\nThe AC Milan midfielder made his presence felt in Serie A last year, finding the back of the net 12 times and tallying eight assists. Pulisic is the USMNT's biggest threat in the scoring third, so expect him to be at - or near - the top of the list of the Yanks' goal scoring leaders.\n\nIf you want to take a dark horse bet involving the United States' most important player, he's +4000 at DraftKings to lead the tournament in scoring.\n\nUSMNT Copa America picks: To Win All Group C Games (+450 or better)\n\nConsider this among the many Copa America long shot picks you can make and while it's not too likely, it's certainly possible.\n\nThe USMNT did receive a 5-1 shellacking at the hands of Colombia ahead of the Copa America, their 1-1 draw against Brazil should inspire confidence in their performance in Group C.\n\nUruguay poises the largest looming challenge, the Yanks have fared well against La Celeste of late, posting draws in their last two meetings. Striker Luis Suarez will pose the biggest challenge, but with USMNT notching 11 saves against Brazil, the defense seems up for the challenge.\n\nDue to confederation familiarity, the fixture against Panama is another one to watch - especially considering the USA's loss to them in last year's Gold Cup. They're 5-3-2 against them in the last 10 meetings. This market can be found at DraftKings.\n\nYou must be over 21 to play. Gambling Problem?

Can Argentina be champions again?\n\nHow times have changed for Argentina. Three years ago, the country's press and fans were openly wondering if the Albiceleste would ever win another major trophy as their title drought approached three decades. That changed when Lionel Scaloni's men beat Brazil in the final of the 2021 Copa America at Rio de Janeiro's Maracana stadium.\n\nLess than 18 months later, they went one better by lifting the World Cup trophy for the first time since 1986 with a penalty shootout victory over France in Qatar.\n\nBut can the South American giants make it three major trophies in a row?\n\nRecent results would suggest so. The Albiceleste have been in ominous form of late, having scored three goals or more in three of their past four matches, including a 4-1 rout of Guatemala in their final Copa America warmup fixture last Friday (June 14).\n\nAnother triumph in the United States would make Scaloni's side the first team to successfully defend the Copa America while simultaneously holding the World Cup trophy.\n\n2. Is this really the United States' Golden Generation?\n\nManager Gregg Berhalter has what is arguably the strongest playing list ever assembled by the United States for a major football tournament.\n\nEighteen of the 26 players named in Berhalter's squad ply their trade in one of Europe's top leagues (England, Spain, Italy, France, Germany and the Netherlands).\n\nThe midfield looks particularly dangerous, marshaled by Juventus star Weston McKennie, AC Milan's Yunus Musah and Nottingham Forest playmaker Giovanni Reyna.\n\nThe attack will be led by Christian Pulisic, who says he is in career-best form after a superb season at AC Milan.\n\n3. Brazil's new Golden Boy\n\nEndrick this month became the youngest player since Pele to score in three consecutive matches for Brazil. But the 17-year-old is no certainty to start for the Selecao at the Copa America.\n\nHead coach Dorival Junior has promised not to ask too much of Endrick during the Copa America as the attacker vies for a place in the starting lineup alongside Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, Raphinha, Savinho and Gabriel Martinelli.\n\n\"I have always been in favor of giving chances to young players but I just ask for a little patience with the boy so that things can happen naturally,\" Dorival told reporters earlier this month.\n\n4: Uruguay: The Bielsa effect\n\nUpon his appointment as Uruguay's manager in May last year, Marcelo Bielsa said his role would involve daring the Celeste's players to dream. The team's impressive sequence of results under the Argentine would suggest he is succeeding.\n\nThe Celeste have won seven, drawn three and lost two matches under Bielsa's stewardship, a run that has included World Cup qualifying victories over Brazil and Argentina.\n\nBielsa's 26-man Copa America list includes a balanced mix of youth and experience while boasting an array of world-class talent such as Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde, Barcelona defender Ronald Araujo, Atletico Madrid defender Jose Gimenez and Liverpool forward Darwin Nunez.\n\nVeteran marksman Luis Suarez will likely be an option off the bench, despite his prolific recent scoring form for Inter Miami. Suarez's long-time national team strike partner Edinson Cavani is not a part of the Celeste squad after announcing his retirement from international football in May.\n\n5. Colombia's formidable form\n\nColombia will deservedly enter the Copa America as one of the tournament favorites. The Cafeteros are unbeaten in 20 matches since Argentine Nestor Lorenzo replaced Reinaldo Rueda as manager in June 2022.\n\nThe sequence has included victories over Germany, Spain, Brazil, Mexico and the United States over the past year.\n\nColombia's strength is a stable defense - led by the center-back pairing of Jhon Lucumi and Carlos Cuesta - and an attack spearheaded by Liverpool winger Luis Diaz.\n\nPerhaps one weak spot is the middle of the park. James Rodriguez and Jhon Arias are the central pieces of a midfield that could lack depth, particularly if injuries strike.\n\n6. Gareca's Copa America record\n\nChile boss Ricardo Gareca, has a Midas touch in the Copa America, having guided Peru to second and third places in the previous two editions.\n\nThe 66-year-old Argentine, who was appointed Chile manager in January, has shown that he is not afraid to make tough decisions as he oversees a generational overhaul of La Roja's squad.\n\nAmong those missing from Chile's current playing group are Arturo Vidal and Gary Medel, integral members of the side that won back-to-back Copa America titles in 2015 and 2016.\n\nOne veteran who has remained in Gareca's plans is Eduardo Vargas, who was the Copa America's leading scorer in both 2015 and 2016, with four and six goals, respectively.\n\nThe 34-year-old Atletico Mineiro forward has 14 Copa America goals, three shy of the record that is jointly held by Argentine midfielder Norberto Mendez and Brazil playmaker Zizinho.\n\n7. The last dance?\n\nWhile Lionel Messi has not yet entertained the idea of retirement - at least publicly - this will almost certainly be his last Copa America.\n\nArgentina's talismanic captain will turn 37 during the tournament's group stage and he will be 41 when the next edition comes around.\n\nOne player who has already made a decision about his future is Messi's long-time national teammate and close friend, Angel Di Maria.\n\nThe 36-year-old has confirmed that he will end his 16-year international career after the Copa America.\n\nThe Benfica winger has been capped 140 times for his country and, with one World Cup trophy and a Copa America triumph to his name, he is already guaranteed legend status for the Albiceleste. Who would deny him one last shot at glory?\n\n8. Venezuela's high hopes\n\nVenezuela have never progressed beyond the quarterfinals of the continental tournament, having reached the last eight in 2011 and 2016.\n\nBut the Vinotinto have good reason to believe this could be their best ever Copa America campaign.\n\nSince Fernando Batista replaced Jose Pekerman as head coach in March 2023, Venezuela have played 12 matches, winning five, drawing five and losing just two.\n\nThe encouraging run of results has included victories over Chile and Paraguay and a draw against Brazil in 2026 World Cup qualifiers.", "source": {"uri": "europesun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "europesun.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Scaloni", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Scaloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Berhalter", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gregg Berhalter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

It's very difficult to imagine what can happen because it's still two years away. I don't need to commit right now to whether or not I'll be there,\" he added.\n\nWhat is certain is that Messi, who has managed his workload to try to be in peak condition for the tournament, would relish the chance to win a third straight major tournament with his country after so many years of frustration with his national team.\n\n- Tough opposition -\n\nAfter facing Canada, Argentina take on Chile in New Jersey before finishing their group A action against Peru in Miami but they know that tough opposition awaits in the knock-out stage with rivals Brazil and Uruguay the two expected challengers for the title.\n\nBrazil have struggled in CONMEBOL qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup having won just two of their opening six games and they currently sit in sixth place in the standings having lost to Uruguay, Colombia and Argentina.\n\nUruguay, also 15-times winners, have impressed under their 68-year-old Argentina coach Marcelo Bielsa, who has brought his trademark high-energy style to the team and raised expectations with recent wins over Argentina and Brazil.\n\nLiverpool forward Darwin Nunez will lead the line although Bielsa has the option of introducing veteran Luis Suarez from the bench.\n\nColombia head into the tournament without a loss in over two years and with Liverpool's livewire winger Luis Diaz a constant threat and James Rodriguez enjoying a late career revival, Nestor Lorenzo's team can't be discounted.\n\nThe USA will hope that they can generate some sorely needed excitement after losing their way since a creditable run to the last-16 at the World Cup.\n\nCoach Gregg Berhalter is under some pressure to show he can get his team, which relies on the smart wing play of Christian Pulisic, to compete with teams from outside of CONCACAF.\n\nMexico have guested frequently in the Copa in the past and reached the final in 1993 and 2001, but they look well below their usual level although they can, as always, count on huge support in the USA.\n\nThis is the second time the Copa America is being held in the USA, after the Centenary tournament in 2016, and while that is a break with tradition the presence of significant immigrant communities from all the competing nations, should ensure big crowds at the mostly NFL stadiums being used.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"},

But that does not make us believe that we are going to win this Copa America by walking,\" Messi said.\n\nRanked number one in the FIFA world rankings, Argentina will face 49th-ranked Canada.\n\nWith newly appointed American coach Jesse Marsch, Canada are using the tournament as preparation for the 2026 World Cup which they will co-host with the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nCanada's Copa America squad features only two players over age 30 -- goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau (30) and midfielder Jonathan Osorio (32) -- and 15 are aged 25 or younger.\n\n\"I think it's been good for this new group. It's kind of a new era and guys are responding really well,\" Osorio said.\n\nThe youthfulness contrasts with Messi, who turns 37 on Monday and has shown no signs of slowing down, with 12 goals in 12 matches for Inter Miami in the MLS this season.\n\nCanada's next match is against Peru on Tuesday, the same day Argentina face Chile. Both teams will wrap up their group games on June 29 with Canada taking on Chile and Argentina playing Peru.\n\nLatest on SportstarWI vs ENG Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Pooran, Russell fall in

After previously stating that the 2022 World Cup would be his last, Messi told Star+ in December that \"time will tell.\"\n\n\"As long as I feel I am well and that I am able to help, I will do it,\" Messi, who will turn 37 during the Copa Am\u00e9rica, said. \"Today, all I think about is to get well to the Copa Am\u00e9rica and play it. Fight for it again, as we always do, try to be the champions.\n\n\u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda is retiring after the tournament.\n\nCatherine Ivill/Getty Images\n\n\"If we do well at Copa Am\u00e9rica and I can keep playing, maybe it happens.\"\n\nBut Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni, who has overseen just four defeats in the team's last 50 games, had a message for Messi fans: Don't worry about the future, just enjoy the now.\n\n\"We Argentines are too melancholic and we are already thinking about the day when he is gone while he's still playing,\" Scaloni said last week. \"So let's enjoy him and we'll see what happens tomorrow. I think the present is so important for the whole world - not only for Argentina - because, in the end, Leo plays for everyone who likes football.\"\n\nOne player who will definitely be making his last tournament appearance for Argentina is \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda.\n\nThe 36-year-old has made 140 appearances for the national team and enjoys legendary status back home thanks to his winner in the final of the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica and a goal in the 2022 World Cup final.\n\nDi Mar\u00eda also won the U20 World Cup in 2007 and an Olympic gold medal at Beijing 2008.\n\nThe best of the rest\n\nBrazil\n\nPreviously thought of as one of, if not the greatest football nation on earth, Brazil currently finds itself navigating a complicated transitional period.\n\nThe squad for the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica is largely inexperienced, with 15 players on less than 10 caps for their country. Only one player, West Ham's Lucas Paquet\u00e1, has reached 10 goals for Brazil, making the omissions of Casemiro and Richarlison all the more surprising.\n\nThe Sele\u00e7\u00e3o is still reeling from the absence of star man Neymar Jr., who ruptured his ACL playing for the national team in October. Brazil's all-time record goalscorer and a player with the ability to change a game in an instant, Neymar will be sorely missed for his contributions on the pitch, but also his leadership and status as an icon in an inexperienced dressing room.\n\nVin\u00edcius Jr. has been one of the best players in the world this season.\n\nCatherine Ivill/Getty Images\n\nBrazil recently suffered back-to-back World Cup qualifier set-backs for the first time in its history, before going on to lose a third in a row. That third defeat - a 1-0 loss to Argentina at the Maracan\u00e3 - was historic, too, marking the first time Brazil had ever lost a home World Cup qualifier.\n\nInterim coach Fernando Diniz was sacked in January, less than halfway through his one-year deal, and replaced by journeyman manager Dorival J\u00fanior, who has so far overseen narrow wins against England and Mexico and draws against the USA and Spain.\n\nBut despite the team's recent struggles, the pressure and expectation will still be high back home - in particular with Vin\u00edcius Jr. leading the attack.\n\nThe Real Madrid forward has enjoyed a sensational season for Los Blancos, helping the team to a La Liga and Champions League double and making himself the favorite to win the Ballon d'Or.\n\nUruguay\n\nPerennial overachiever Uruguay once again goes into a Copa Am\u00e9rica among the favorites to win the title.\n\nThe nation of just 3.5 million people holds the joint record alongside Argentina for most Copa Am\u00e9rica titles won with 15.\n\nUnder new manager Marcelo Bielsa, who took charge in May 2023, a new, youthful Uruguay has made a tremendous start to World Cup qualifying, winning four of its six matches so far - including 2-0 wins over Brazil and Argentina - to sit second in the standings.\n\nMarcelo Bielsa has made a great start as Uruguay manager.\n\nAnder Gillenea/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhile Bielsa has called up many inexperienced and uncapped players during his tenure so far to better implement his high intensity press, national team icon Luis Su\u00e1rez made the cut and will be supported by a talented cast that includes Jos\u00e9 Gim\u00e9nez, Ronald Ara\u00fajo and Federico Valverde.\n\nThe host\n\nThe USA enters the Copa Am\u00e9rica off the back of winning a third straight Nations League title, beating bitter rival Mexico 2-0 in the final less than two months ago.\n\nHowever, preparations for the tournament got off to the worst possible start with a 5-1 hammering at the hands of Colombia in Washington.\n\nAfter the defeat, goalkeeper Matt Turner said the team needed to \"bounce back in a big way,\" and a much-improved performance followed in a morale-boosting 1-1 draw against Brazil.\n\nDespite boasting several talented players, including Tim Weah, Christian Pulisic, Yunus Musah and Folarin Balogun, serious questions remain about whether the US men can consistently compete against teams outside of the weaker CONCACAF bubble.\n\nThe US won a third straight CONCACAF Nations League title.\n\nRon Jenkins/Getty Images\n\nFortunately for the US, the group draw has been kind. First up is a weak Bolivia side which has endured an abysmal start to World Cup qualifying, losing five of its first six matches, before a clash against familiar CONCACAF opponent Panama.\n\nThe sternest test will come last against Uruguay, but Gregg Berhalter's side should have enough quality to at least advance to the knockout stages. Anything less could be a disaster as the team attempts to drum up support across the country ahead of a home World Cup.\n\nDark Horses\n\nChile\n\nOnly a couple of months ago, you will likely have been hard pressed to find a Chile fan optimistic enough to predict that the team would make it past the group stages.\n\nThe failure to qualify for back-to-back World Cups in 2018 and 2022 has been a bitter pill to swallow for everyone involved after the country's 'Golden Generation' won successive Copa Am\u00e9ricas in 2015 and 2016 and reached the final of the 2017 Confederations Cup.\n\nSince Juan Antonio Pizzi was sacked as manager after the team missed out on Russia 2018, three successive coaches failed to get a tune out of the team - then Ricardo Gareca was hired.\n\nChile is finding form at the right time.\n\nMarcelo Hernandez/Getty Images\n\nGareca, who impressively took Peru to the 2018 World Cup and the final of the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica, has had an immediate impact on the team since taking over in January, leading La Roja to comprehensive 3-0 wins over Paraguay and Albania and pushing France close in a 3-2 defeat in Marseille.\n\nBig names such as Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Claudio Bravo remain in the squad, but there is no place for Arturo Vidal or Gary Medel.\n\nIt might be a bit much to say expectations are now high, but fans are finally excited about watching La Roja playing again.\n\nColombia\n\nColombia arrives in the US as arguably the most in-form team in the tournament, if not the world.\n\nLos Cafeteros are currently on a 23-game unbeaten run that includes wins in their last eight matches. With three wins and three draws so far in World Cup qualifying, the team has soared to third place in the standings to put the failure of reaching Qatar 2022 behind it.\n\nColombia is on a long unbeaten run.\n\nGonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Getty Images\n\nLiverpool's Luis D\u00edaz will be Colombia's main man at the Copa Am\u00e9rica, supported by well-known veterans such as James Rodriguez, David Ospina and Yerry Mina.\n\nThe main issue for Colombia is its brutal potential route to the final, during which it will likely have to face Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com",

The U.S., Mexico, Canada, Costa Rica, Panama and Jamaica join the 10 South American nations after qualifying from North and Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nEcuador was to host the tournament under the rotation of CONMEBOL, South American soccer's governing body, but declined. The tournament was then moved to the U.S., which also hosted the special centennial Copa America in 2016 as Chile won on penalty kicks over Argentina at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\nEleven NFL stadiums are being used, including eight of the 11 U.S. venues for the 2026 World Cup, plus three smaller MLS homes. The final will be at Miami Gardens, Florida, on July 14, starting five hours after the European Championship final in Berlin.\n\nCONMEBOL says more than 1 million tickets have been sold for the 32 matches. The 2016 tournament drew just under 1.5 million, and the 2019 tournament in Brazil about 850,000. The 2021 Copa was played mostly without fans because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThis will be the biggest test for the U.S. team before the World Cup -- the Americans get an automatic berth as co-host along with Mexico and Canada -- and most Europe-based players are expected to skip next year's CONCACAF Gold Cup.\n\nChristian Pulisic, Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie are the core of a team that returns 18 players from the 2022 World Cup roster.\n\n\"A World Cup on home soil is the biggest thing that you know we'll probably do in our career,\" Pulisic said. \"It's a special time for this sport in America.\"\n\nIn 2016, CONMEBOL partnered with the U.S. Soccer Federation, which was in charge of most of the logistics. This time, CONMEBOL is co-organizing the tournament with CONCACAF, the governing body of North and Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nUnlike during the World Cup, the organizers have only short-term access to venues. At Hard Rock, a concert is scheduled for July 6, between the last group stage game and the final, and a new grass surface will be installed.\n\nAt MetLife Stadium, where a semifinal will be played July 9, staff will look at it as a preview for the World Cup final on July 19, 2026. The stadium has a camera system designed by Arecont Vision and managed by Genetec Security Center that was installed before the 2014 Super Bowl and a new system by Axis Communications is being put in place this summer in the seating bowl with 80 8K, 41-megapixel cameras.\n\n\"We can see every seat all the time. I think it serves as a good deterrent,\" said Daniel DeLorenzi, vice president of security and safety services. \"We have three drone detection systems. ...

Date, Time, TV Channels and Online Streaming", "body": "How to watch the FA Cup Final? Date, Time, TV channels and online streaming\n\nWith all the attention on Euro 2024, you may have forgotten that the Copa America is taking place alongside it this summer.\n\nArgentina are the current holders having won the tournament for the 15th time in 2021, beating Brazil in the final.\n\nBut a long line of nations will be looking to pinch Lionel Messi and Co's crown and become the top dogs of the continent.\n\nThe 2022 World Cup winners enter as favourites and are being tipped to move clear of Uruguay and become the most successful nation in the tournament's history.\n\nBut the likes of Brazil, Uruguay, Colombia, Mexico and the United States will fancy themselves to provide stiff competition.\n\nWith games on almost every day between 21 June and 15 July, you will not want to miss a second of the action. In this article, we will tell you how you can watch and keep up to date with the 2024 Copa America.\n\nThe United States will host the 2024 Copa America having only been involved in the tournament four times previously.\n\n14 different stadiums will be used across the entire country, meaning local kick-off times will also be varied due to the different time zones in the US.\n\nThe final will be played at the Hard Rock Stadium in Florida, home of the Miami Dolphins, while the semi-finals will take place in New Jersey and North Carolina.\n\nChampions Argentina will kick off the tournament against Group A opponents Canada in the early hours of Friday morning for UK viewers.\n\nFollowing that, a minimum of two group games a day will be played until 3 July, before the quarter-finals take place on 5, 6 and 7 July.\n\nA few days break will come after the first round of knockouts before the semi-finals on 10 and 11 July, before the grand final in Miami on 15 July.\n\nArgentina are on an incredible run in major competitions, having won the last two they have competed in.\n\nMessi has only got so many years left on the international stage but his hunger to win another title with his country will be as fierce as ever.\n\nLa Albiceleste have not lost a friendly game since 2019 and have only suffered defeat in all competitions once since the Saudi Arabia loss in the World Cup two years ago.\n\nThey rounded off their warm-up fixtures with a win over Guatemala and enter the tournament as strong favourites.\n\nBrazil - 2021 finalists and nine-time winners of the Copa America - are going to be a huge threat to Argentina. With the likes of Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo and Endrick running things in attack, they will feel confident ahead of the tournament.\n\nUruguay beat both Argentina and Brazil in recent World Cup qualifying matches and they have some hidden gems in their squad. Darwin Nunez, Federico Valverde and Ronald Aruajo are three top-class players who will help lead the third favourites into battle.\n\nElsewhere, there is little to split Mexico and the US in the bookies' odds, but they are certainly dark horses, especially the host nation who will be playing in front of energised crowds.\n\nMeanwhile, Ecuador are an outside shout, but realistically it would take something special for them to win the tournament.\n\nPremier Sports hold exclusive rights to broadcast the 2024 Copa America and will be showing all 32 games live across June and July.\n\nYou can find Premier Sports 1 and Premier Sports 2 on channels 419 and 420 on Sky and for Virgin Media, it is 551 and 552.\n\nYes! Premier Sports have a web browser available for all subscribers to watch through their computers or tablets, should you not be able to secure TV rights from your partner or parents!\n\nYou can find the date and time for every Copa America match below:", "source": {"uri": "101greatgoals.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "101greatgoals.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mitch_fretton@101greatgoals.com",

No other nation has won more than two\n\nLionel Messi and Argentina will try to match Spain's feat of three consecutive major titles when the Copa America kicks off on Thursday night.\n\nComing off championships in the 2021 Copa America and the 2022 World Cup, Messi will be four days shy of his 37th birthday when the Albiceleste take the field against Canada at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.\n\n\"I want to enjoy a couple of more matches being a world champion,\" Messi said after Argentina beat France on penalty kicks to win the 2022 World Cup final.\n\nHe has 10 goals in 10 international appearances since, raising his total to 108 in 182 games for Argentina's national team. He is either tied for second with Ali Daei or one behind, depending on whether a disputed goal by the Iranian is counted, trailing only Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo at 128.\n\n\"It is not easy to compete again after winning it all,\" coach Lionel Scaloni said.\n\nArgentina and Uruguay are tied with 15 Copa titles each, followed by Brazil with nine.

The emerging star is 17-year-old Endrick, who joins Real Madrid this summer.\n\n\"If you look at every position in their proposed starting 11, it's probably one of the world's best players,\" US coach Gregg Berhalter said.\n\nSpain is the only nation to win three consecutive major titles: the European Championship in 2008 and 2012 around the 2010 World Cup.\n\nThere will be 16 teams, just as in 2016.

I don't know and I hope he enjoys it as he has been enjoying it until now, and then he will decide.\"\n\nMartino, who is Argentinian, said he believes his country has a great chance of lifting the Copa but added there are other teams that are hungry and capable.\n\n\"Unlike other Copa Am\u00e9ricas, there are several teams besides Argentina and Brazil that are very good, that have a lot of potential and are willing to fight for it,\" Martino said. \"It seems to me that it will be a very attractive competition.

The participating nations were sorted into four groups, and the top two teams from each group will advance to the quarter-finals.\n\nThe tournament is shaping up to be the most competitive edition in recent memory, with Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, the United States, and Colombia all capable of making a deep run in the competition.\n\nOnly one side can win the Copa America, though, and the Opta supercomputer revealed which of the favorites is also the analytics' favorite.\n\nOpta predicted Lionel Messi and Argentina will win Copa America 2024. The analytics say the reigning champions have a 30.8% chance to lift their record-breaking 16th Copa America title this summer.\n\nThe prediction is anything but far-fetched. La Albiceleste were sorted into Group A, featuring Chile, Peru, and Canada, which puts them on the easier side of the Copa America 2024 bracket. Their main competition (Brazil, Uruguay, and Colombia) are all on the other side, meaning Argentina would not meet any of the teams until the final.\n\nArgentina should finish atop Group A quite easily, and then they will presumably face either Mexico or Ecuador in the quarter-finals. Opta gives Lionel Scaloni's men an 89.9% chance to appear in the quarter-finals and a 67.2% to win the match.\n\nLa Albiceleste's semifinal matchup is a bit harder to predict, but again, Argentina should book their ticket to Hard Rock Stadium if they perform to their standards. Opta revealed the defending champions have a 50.5% chance to make the Copa America 2024 final.\n\nArgentina might be the overwhelming favorites to win Copa America 2024, but Opta also predicted where every other team will finish this summer in the United States.\n\nCopa America 2024 kicks off on June 20 as Argentina take on Canada at 8 p.m. ET.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opta_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Opta Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CONCACAF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peru"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Peru"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Scaloni", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Scaloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Rock_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hard Rock Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Petanque", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Petanque", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Croquet", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Croquet", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5410,h_3043,x_0,y_301/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/90min_en_international_web/01j0rq4qb46edkp260tb.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658543", "eventUri": "eng-9658543", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 2055, "textEnd": 2062}], "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

He is either tied for second with Ali Daei or one behind, depending on whether a disputed goal by the Iranian is counted, trailing only Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo at 128.\n\n\"It is not easy to compete again after winning it all,\" Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said.\n\nArgentina and Uruguay are tied with 15 Copa titles each, followed by Brazil with nine. No other nation has won more than two.\n\nBrazil features an attack headed by Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior and Rodrygo, just off a Champions League title with Real Madrid, and Raphinha. The emerging star is 17-year-old Endrick, who joins Real Madrid this summer.\n\n\"If you look at every position in their proposed starting 11, it's probably one of the world's best players,\" U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter said.\n\nSpain is the only nation to win three consecutive major titles: the European Championship in 2008 and 2012 around the 2010 World Cup.\n\nThere will be 16 teams, just as in 2016. The U.S., Mexico, Canada, Costa Rica, Panama and Jamaica join the 10 South American nations after qualifying from North and Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nBack in the USA\n\nEcuador was to host the tournament under the rotation of CONMEBOL, South American soccer's governing body, but declined. The tournament was then moved to the U.S., which also hosted the special centennial Copa America in 2016 as Chile won on penalty kicks over Argentina at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\nEleven NFL stadiums are being used, including eight of the 11 U.S. venues for the 2026 World Cup, plus three smaller MLS homes. The final will be at Miami Gardens, Florida, on July 14, starting five hours after the European Championship final in Berlin.\n\nCONMEBOL says more than 1 million tickets have been sold for the 32 matches. The 2016 tournament drew just under 1.5 million, and the 2019 tournament in Brazil about 850,000. The 2021 Copa was played mostly without fans because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nU.S. team\n\nThis will be the biggest test for the U.S. team before the World Cup -- the Americans get an automatic berth as co-host along with Mexico and Canada -- and most Europe-based players are expected to skip next year's CONCACAF Gold Cup.\n\nChristian Pulisic, Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie are the core of a team that returns 18 players from the 2022 World Cup roster.\n\n\"A World Cup on home soil is the biggest thing that you know we'll probably do in our career,\" Pulisic said. \"It's a special time for this sport in America.\"\n\nWorld Cup test?\n\nIn 2016, CONMEBOL partnered with the U.S. Soccer Federation, which was in charge of most of the logistics. This time, CONMEBOL is co-organizing the tournament with CONCACAF, the governing body of North and Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nUnlike during the World Cup, the organizers have only short-term access to venues. At Hard Rock, a concert is scheduled for July 6, between the last group stage game and the final, and a new grass surface will be installed.\n\nAt MetLife Stadium, where a semifinal will be played July 9, staff will look at it as a preview for the World Cup final on July 19, 2026. The stadium has a camera system designed by Arecont Vision and managed by Genetec Security Center that was installed before the 2014 Super Bowl and a new system by Axis Communications is being put in place this summer in the seating bowl with 80 8K, 41-megapixel cameras.\n\n\"We can see every seat all the time. I think it serves as a good deterrent,\" said Daniel DeLorenzi, vice president of security and safety services. \"We have three drone detection systems. ... Not only can we track the drone, but more importantly, we can track where the operator is.\"", "source": {"uri": "tsn.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "TSN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This tournament is of huge importance to coach Gregg Berhalter and his staff because it's one of the last times he will get to see his players in action in a competitive tournament ahead of the 2026 World Cup, which the USA is co-hosting.\n\nWith mostly friendly matches and no World Cup qualifiers, this is a crucial test for the USMNT to see how they match up with the best from the Western Hemisphere and how far they still have to go.\n\nThe USMNT last played in the Copa America when it was last in the U.S., in 2016 to celebrate Copa America's centenary. The U.S. finished in fourth place, beating Ecuador in the quarterfinals after winning Group A, but being crushed by Argentina in the semifinals. The U.S. then lost the third-place match to Colombia.\n\nPrior to that, the U.S. had three other Copa America appearances, the best of which was a legendary fourth place finish in Uruguay with mostly amateur players in 1995, a year before MLS came into being and a year after the rag-tag USMNT bunch got out of their group at the 1994 World Cup on home soil.\n\nMORE: Where to watch Copa America 2024: Full broadcast schedule for all matches on FOX and Fubo\n\nThe Sporting News looks at the key details ahead of this game, including how to watch it across the world, kickoff times and the latest lineup news.\n\nThe USA begin their Copa America run against Bolivia on Sunday, June 23 at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Kickoff is at 5:00 p.m. local time.\n\nFans from across the region will be tuning in to watch the USMNT's Copa America opener. Here's how that kickoff time translates across the United States and the rest of the world:\n\nHere's how to watch this Copa America 2024 match across selected areas of the world's major regions:\n\nUSA: Copa America 2024 matches will be broadcast in English on Fox Sports with streaming options available on Fubo where new users can sign up to a FREE trial. For this game, fans can find the match on their local Fox network affiliate. Fans can also catch the match in Spanish on Univision or TUDN USA on TV with streaming on ViX.\n\nCanada: TSN and TSN+ is the place to go for Copa America 2024 action in Canada. This match will be broadcast on TSN 4 with streaming also available on RDS.\n\nBerhalter announced his 26-man squad for Copa America on June 14. Of the 27-man squad that took part in a pre-tournament training camp, only midfielder Timothy Tillman was cut. Josh Sargent, a pre-tournament injury worry, was included for the time being.\n\nU.S. Soccer has until Saturday at 6:00 p.m. ET to make any last minute injury replacements.\n\nAges, caps are correct as of June 17, 2024 and the start of Copa America.\n\nThe USMNT has competed at Copa America on four previous occasions, finishing in fourth place twice. The most impressive was in 1995, with a group of mostly amateurs who hadn't yet started MLS, making it to the semifinals and beating Argentina 3-0 in the group stage. In 2007, the U.S. sent a B-team to Copa America while the A-Team competed in the Gold Cup, and they were eliminated in the group stage.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news",

It's very difficult to imagine what can happen because it's still two years away. I don't need to commit right now to whether or not I'll be there,\" he added.\n\nWhat is certain is that Messi, who has managed his workload to try to be in peak condition for the tournament, would relish the chance to win a third straight major tournament with his country after so many years of frustration with his national team.\n\nTough opposition\n\nAfter facing Canada, Argentina take on Chile in New Jersey before finishing their group A action against Peru in Miami but they know that tough opposition awaits in the knock-out stage with rivals Brazil and Uruguay the two expected challengers for the title.\n\nBrazil have struggled in CONMEBOL qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup having won just two of their opening six games and they currently sit in sixth place in the standings having lost to Uruguay, Colombia and Argentina.\n\nThere are several familiar names missing from Dorival Junior's Brazil squad with Casemiro, Gabriel Jesus and Thiago Silva left out while Richarlison and Neymar are both missing due to injury.\n\nThe pressure will be on the Real Madrid attacking pair of Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo to translate their club form into success for the Selecao while there is much excitement around the senior tournament debut of 17-year-old talent Endrick, who is set to join Real next month from Palmeiras.\n\nUruguay, also 15-times winners, have impressed under their 68-year-old Argentina coach Marcelo Bielsa, who has brought his trademark high-energy style to the team and raised expectations with recent wins over Argentina and Brazil.\n\nLiverpool forward Darwin Nunez will lead the line although Bielsa has the option of introducing veteran Luis Suarez from the bench.\n\nColombia head into the tournament without a loss in over two years and with Liverpool's livewire winger Luis Diaz a constant threat and James Rodriguez enjoying a late career revival, Nestor Lorenzo's team can't be discounted.\n\nThe USA will hope that they can generate some sorely needed excitement after losing their way since a creditable run to the last-16 at the World Cup.\n\nCoach Gregg Berhalter is under some pressure to show he can get his team, which relies on the smart wing play of Christian Pulisic, to compete with teams from outside of CONCACAF.\n\nMexico have guested frequently in the Copa in the past and reached the final in 1993 and 2001, but they look well below their usual level although they can, as always, count on huge support in the USA.\n\nThis is the second time the Copa America is being held in the USA, after the Centenary tournament in 2016, and while that is a break with tradition the presence of significant immigrant communities from all the competing nations, should ensure big crowds at the mostly NFL stadiums being used.",

Here's a group-by-group preview and predictions", "body": "Copa America kicks off Thursday night in Atlanta, with Inter Miami icon Lionel Messi and his defending champion Argentina team facing Canada at Mercedes Benz Stadium.\n\nLa Albiceleste (sky blue and white) are not only the reigning Copa champions, but also the World Cup champions, so they are the team to beat as the month-long tournament gets underway. Other teams expected to advance include Uruguay, Colombia, Brazil, Mexico and the host United States.\n\nHow it Works: The 16-team field is comprised of 10 teams from South America and six from North and Central America and the Caribbean. The tournament begins with four groups of four teams. During the group phase, teams earn three points for a win, one for a tie, and zero for a loss. After each team has played its group opponents once, the top two will advance.\n\nHere's a look at the groups, and predictions of which teams will move on to the knockout stage...\n\nGROUP A: Argentina, Peru, Chile, Canada\n\nDefending champion Argentina is the heavy favorite to raise the trophy again. Inter Miami star Messi, the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner, led La Albiceleste to the 2022 World Cup title and since their 2-1 loss to Saudi Arabia in the opening game of that World Cup, Argentina has won 17 of its past 18 matches. Their only loss was 2-0 to Uruguay in a World Cup qualifier.\n\nMessi is joined by a loaded roster that includes Julian Alvarez (Manchester City), Lautaro Martinez (Inter Milan), Rodrigo De Paul (Atletico de Madrid), Alexis Mac Allister (Liverpool), Enzo Fernandez (Chelsea), Cristian Romero and Lisandro Martinez.\n\nChile is expected to be the second-strongest team with veteran Alexis Sanchez among the players to watch. Chile beat Argentina twice in 2015 and 2016 in penalty kicks in the Copa America final.\n\nCanada has a shot to pull off an upset or two under new American coach Jesse Marsch. Peru lost 2-0 to both Argentina and Chile in World Cup qualifying and will have a tough time getting through the group, but if Edison Flores scores goals, La Rojiblanca could pull a surprise.\n\nOnce upon a time, Mexico would have been a lock to win this group, but things are more unpredictable these days.\n\nEl Tri has played in 10 Copa Americas, finished runner-up twice and third three times. But the team has struggled in recent years and lost two Copa warmup matches last week, 4-0 to Uruguay and 3-2 to Brazil, after a 1-0 win against Bolivia. The Mexican team is in a rebuild under coach Jaime Lozano, who left out some of the old guard and called up several Under-23 players. They could still advance, but maybe not win the group.\n\nEcuador has never won the Copa, and its best finish in the past four decades was fourth place in 1993, but this year's team is good enough to finish atop Group B. Coach F\u00e9lix Sanchez Bas has a talented roster, including Piero Hincapie of Bayer Leverkusen, Moises Caicedo of Chelsea and veteran leader Enner Valencia.\n\nThe host USA is the headliner of the group and will have home-field advantage (although South American fans often outnumber the red, white and blue on U.S. soil). This U.S. team, led by captain Christian Pulisic, is arguably the most talented in the nation's history with nearly all its players based overseas. Pulisic and Yunus Musah play for AC Milan. Weston McKennie and Tim Weah play for Juventus. Matt Turner and Gio Reyna are teammates at Nottingham Forest. But the team had mixed results in Copa warmup matches, losing 5-1 to Colombia before rebounding with a 1-1 tie against Brazil.\n\nCo-favorite to advance is Uruguay, the 15-time South American champions, who are hungry to win for the first time since 2011. They have a good shot under the direction of Marcelo Bielsa and with Liverpool's Darwin Nunez leading the attack. Since last June, Uruguay has only lost two of 10 games under Bielsa and the team sits in second place in the CONMEBOL World Cup Qualifiers, three points behind Argentina. Inter Miami star Luis Suarez, 37, is on Uruguay's squad and eager to go far in what will likely be his last Copa.\n\nPanama and Bolivia would have to pull off shockers to survive this group. MLS duo Anibal Godoy and Adalberto 'Coco' Carrasquilla are two Panamanian players to watch. Panama has beaten the USA and made strides in recent years, but advancing will be tough. Bolivia's best player, Marcelo Martins Moreno, retired.\n\nBrazil is desperate to have a good showing after stumbling to sixth place in World Cup qualifying so far. Things are so bad that former star Ronaldinho slammed the team last week, posting on social media: \"That's it folks. l've had enough. This is a sad moment for those who love Brazilian soccer. It's getting hard to find the spirit to watch the games. This is perhaps one of the worst teams in recent years. It has no respectable leaders, only average players for the majority.\"\n\nThe pressure is on Brazil, which was eliminated from the 2022 World Cup by Croatia in the quarterfinals. The team has shown improvement in recent friendlies under new coach Dorival Junior, including wins over England and Mexico and a 1-1 tie against the USA last week.\n\nThe most in-form team in the group is Colombia, which is unbeaten in 23 games since 2022.

He is either tied for second with Ali Daei or one behind, depending on whether a disputed goal by the Iranian is counted, trailing only Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo at 128.\n\n\"It is not easy to compete again after winning it all,\" Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said.\n\nArgentina and Uruguay are tied with 15 Copa titles each, followed by Brazil with nine. No other nation has won more than two.\n\nBrazil features an attack headed by Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior and Rodrygo, just off a Champions League title with Real Madrid, and Raphinha. The emerging star is 17-year-old Endrick, who joins Real Madrid this summer.\n\n\"If you look at every position in their proposed starting 11, it's probably one of the world's best players,\" US coach Gregg Berhalter said.\n\nSpain is the only nation to win three consecutive major titles: The European Championship in 2008 and 2012 around the 2010 World Cup.\n\nA look at the tournament:\n\nExpanded field\n\nThere will be 16 teams, just as in 2016. The US, Mexico, Canada, Costa Rica, Panama and Jamaica join the 10 South American nations after qualifying from North and Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nBack in the US\n\nEcuador was to host the tournament under the rotation of CONMEBOL, South American soccer's governing body, but declined. The tournament was then moved to the US, which also hosted the special centennial Copa America in 2016 as Chile won on penalty kicks over Argentina at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\nEleven NFL stadiums are being used, including eight of the 11 US venues for the 2026 World Cup, plus three smaller MLS homes. The final will be at Miami Gardens, Florida, on July 14, starting five hours after the European Championship final in Berlin.\n\nCONMEBOL says more than 1 million tickets have been sold for the 32 matches. The 2016 tournament drew just under 1.5 million, and the 2019 tournament in Brazil about 850,000. The 2021 Copa was played mostly without fans because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nUS team\n\nThis will be the biggest test for the US team before the World Cup -- the Americans get an automatic berth as co-host along with Mexico and Canada -- and most Europe-based players are expected to skip next year's CONCACAF Gold Cup.\n\nChristian Pulisic, Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie are the core of a team that returns 18 players from the 2022 World Cup roster.\n\n\"A World Cup on home soil is the biggest thing that you know we'll probably do in our career,\" Pulisic said. \"It's a special time for this sport in America.\"\n\nWorld Cup test?\n\nIn 2016, CONMEBOL partnered with the US Soccer Federation, which was in charge of most of the logistics. This time, CONMEBOL is co-organizing the tournament with CONCACAF, the governing body of North and Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nUnlike during the World Cup, the organizers have only short-term access to venues. At Hard Rock, a concert is scheduled for July 6, between the last group stage game and the final, and a new grass surface will be installed.\n\nAt MetLife Stadium, where a semifinal will be played July 9, staff will look at it as a preview for the World Cup final on July 19, 2026. The stadium has a camera system designed by Arecont Vision and managed by Genetec Security Center that was installed before the 2014 Super Bowl and a new system by Axis Communications is being put in place this summer in the seating bowl with 80 8K, 41-megapixel cameras.\n\n\"We can see every seat all the time. I think it serves as a good deterrent,\" said Daniel DeLorenzi, vice president of security and safety services. \"We have three drone detection systems. ... Not only can we track the drone, but more importantly, we can track where the operator is.\"", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The tournament could mark the 36-year-old Messi's final act with the national team. It could also give the number 10 a final push towards the 2026 World Cup. The early rounds of South American World Cup qualifiers suggest Messi's international run could be extended, as Argentina tops the qualifying after six matches. But a good performance at Copa America could prove decisive for his future. Midfielder Mac Allister will have a good opportunity to show he has developed further as a player if he can keep Argentina moving when Messi's energy goes down during games. Striker Martinez will have another chance to show a good club season for him in Europe can translate into great form with the national team.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Fossati became Peru coach in December with the team at the bottom of the 10-team round robin South American World Cup qualifying. A goalless draw with Paraguay at home on June 7, amid Copa America preparations, suggests not much has improved since. Nothing seems to work on a team that is still tied to veteran players, like goalkeeper Gallese, defender Advincula and striker Lapadula. And newcomers don't seem ready to challenge. Fossati will not start the tournament under pressure, but a first-round elimination in a tough group could make his life in the Peru job difficult very soon.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Chile has struggled to leave its golden generation behind, and its Copa America squad shows it. Goalkeeper Bravo (41) and striker Sanchez (35) are sure to be among the key players on a team that has struggled to compete against fitter rivals in recent years. Defender Gary Medel (36) and midfielder Arturo Vidal (37) didn't make the cut but were not far from being included. Gareca, who took Peru to the World Cup in 2018, has yet to find a starting lineup since he joined in January. A recent 3-0 win against Paraguay gave new hope to the team ahead of the tournament, but it is unlikely Chile will find such weak opposition at the start of the group stage.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Jesse Marsch took over as team manager in mid-May after spending a year at the helm of Leeds United. He has already managed a couple of warm-up matches for Copa America, a 4-0 loss to the Netherlands and 0-0 draw against France. After a disappointing World Cup in Qatar, where the team lost all three of its matches, Canada Soccer is hoping Marsch can do better against tough competition in Copa America, including facing off against reigning world champion Argentina.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Jaime Lozano made a surprising move before Copa America by leaving off veterans Guillermo Ochoa, Raul Jim\u00e9nez, Hirving Lozano and Jesus Gallardo, as well as Henry Martin, because he is trying to give new players a chance to prove they can compete for a spot in the 2026 World Cup. So far, the experiment is not going well. Mexico lost 4-0 against Uruguay and 3-2 against Brazil in friendlies ahead of the tournament, leaving many pundits wondering if the move to go younger at this moment was right. As the friendly games have shown, Mexico is weak on defense. Besides Ochoa's absence, the team has lost projected starting goalkeeper Luis Malag\u00f3n to an injury. Carlos Acevedo, who was called to replace Malag\u00f3n, has looked impressive in practice since his arrival and could be a surprising starter.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Ecuador remains one of the most competitive national teams in South America, much of it due to a generation of players that has been developed at local clubs Independiente del Valle and Liga de Quito. It is in fifth position in the regional World Cup qualifying despite starting with -3 points due to a penalty. But it has yet to show it can play well. Striker Valencia is struggling to score for the national team, and midfielder Caicedo has yet to show the pace he had prior to his move to Chelsea. The team's defence is set to be a strength, led by defender Hincapi\u00e9, who had a great season with German champions Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Venezuela seems set to qualify for the World Cup for the first time, and its strengths are likely to show during Copa America. The team's top form, which includes an away draw at Brazil in World Cup qualifying, was built by coach Jos\u00e9 Pekerman, who left the job in March last year without providing any explanation. When many feared Venezuela would once again tank, Batista managed to keep the team's up front power and improve its transitions. Midfielder Soteldo is recovering from a right thigh injury, and his health could be decisive for the team's future in the tournament.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: The Reggae Boyz will appear in the South American tournament for the third time looking to break a six-game losing streak. Its first opponent, Mexico, could be the most difficult one, despite the absence of some key players. Jamaica will miss Aston Villa's Leon Bailey despite being included in the 26-man roster. Bailey's agent Craig Butler said that Bailey decided to take a break from the team. Coach Heimir Hallgr\u00edmsson has been with the team since 2022 and had good moments in the League of Nations, including a win over Canada that secured their spot in Copa America.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Bielsa has begun a rebuilding process in Uruguay, but he can't give up on veteran players as he assembles his squad for the tournament. Striker N\u00fa\u00f1ez had a reasonable season at Liverpool, in which he scored 18 goals in 54 matches. He is expected to step up as 37-year-old Edinson Cavani retired from the national team. N\u00fa\u00f1ez will have to count on veteran Su\u00e1rez, playing his fifth Copa America, to help him up front. Uruguay beat Mexico 4-0 in a friendly early in June to suggest that any rival that does not respect its strikers will suffer. Midfielder Valverde will be the team's leader in the U.S.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: The U.S. has already proven to be the top team in CONCACAF after beating Mexico in the League of Nations final for the second year in a row. Copa America gives the Americans an opportunity to show they can give the South Americans trouble. The team lost 5-1 to Colombia, a nation that is riding a 22-game unbeaten streak, but then played a good match against Brazil, one of the top two contenders alongside Argentina. The U.S. team looks to be the favorite to move on to the second round with Uruguay, although Panama will be tough to beat. The problem for the Americans should they finish second behind Uruguay is there's a good chance they would meet Brazil in the quarterfinals.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Under Thomas Christensen, the Panamanians have shown consistent progress even though they missed the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Christiansen remains at the helm despite that and last year the team was the runner-up in the Gold Cup and this year they made their way to the Nations League semifinals. Led by the Houston Dynamo's Adalberto Carrasquilla, the player of the tournament in last year's Gold Cup, Panama will try to upset the group favorites Uruguay and the United States. The team arrives at the tournament after securing a couple of victories in the CONCACAF qualifiers against Guyana and Montserrat. The 'Canaleros' will have a final warmup against Paraguay before facing Uruguay.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Bolivia has had a slow start under coach Zago, as its penultimate place in South American World Cup qualifying shows, but the team continues to field young players while looking to the future. Bolivia's hopes in Copa America lie in players who are more like 24-year-old striker Menacho, one of the top goal scorers of his country's national championship. A few veterans remain, including goalkeeper Lampe. The team will miss striker Marcelo Martins, who retired in March at age 36. Unlike most of its competitors, Bolivia's squad mostly includes local players.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: New coach, new starters and no Neymar. Brazil is likely to be competitive at Copa America as the team's performances in friendlies this year suggest, but it is hard to see J\u00fanior's team as heavy favorites. There are a few evident starters in goalkeeper Alisson, defender \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o, midfielder Paquet\u00e1 and winger J\u00fanior but that is about it. Teenager Endrick has delivered goals since he was first called up to the senior team in March, but Brazil's coach has not yet decided whether he or Rodrygo will start. Brazil's bench is filled with players getting their first opportunity with the national team.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Unbeaten for 18 matches, Colombia is one of the favorites to win Copa America, something the team has not done in 23 years. Before beating the United States 5-1 amid preparations for the tournament, Colombia beat Brazil 2-1 in South American World Cup qualifying and topped both Spain and Germany in friendlies in Europe. Midfielder Rodr\u00edguez, who has struggled to play for his clubs in recent years, has delivered good performances for the national team. Colombia is in third place in World Cup qualifying, and a convincing campaign at Copa America could make its physical and skillful team aim higher in the next few years.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Paraguay will use Copa America and the Paris Olympics to try to secure a spot at the 2026 World Cup. Garnero is trying to rejuvenate his squad with the support of two key veterans: defender G\u00f3mez, one of the best on the continent since he arrived in Brazil's Palmeiras, and veteran striker Almir\u00f3n. The performances of 21-year-old midfielder G\u00f3mez of Inter Miami will be key for the Paraguayans to have any hopes of getting through the group. The tournament will also help the coach adjust his team to recover in World Cup qualifying, which currently sees Paraguay in 7th, out of the qualification zone.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: After leading Ecuador to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, Alfaro became the Ticos' coach last November, replacing Luis Fernando Su\u00e1rez. Under Alfaro, the team is making a transition and several key players from the past are gone, including iconic goalkeeper Keylor Navas and veterans Celso Borges and Bryan Ruiz, leaving Joel Campbell and Francisco Calvo as the only veterans on the squad. Costa Rica has won its two World Cup qualifiers against Grenada and Saint Kitts and Nevis and had a 0-0 draw against Uruguay on May 31. Alfaro and his players know sharing the group with Brazil and Colombia, two of the contenders in the tournament, will not be an easy task, especially with a young team facing its first major test.",

Julian Alvarez and Lautaro Martinez will be the two-man frontline.\n\nAlphonso Davies and Allistair Johnston have recovered in time to feature for Canada in this game. Cyle Larin and Jonathan David will be two forwards with Stephen Eustaquio and Ismael Kone as the box-to-box midfielders.

And if you aren't one already, it's the perfect time to jump onboard.\n\n\"Don't let anybody tell you that we're not a soccer nation. Don't let anybody tell that we don't have a soccer culture,\" FOX analyst and former U.S. men's national team standout Alexi Lalas told USA TODAY Sports. \"It's different. It is unique and it is uniquely American. And that's something I think we should lean into and celebrate.\"\n\nCONMEBOL Copa Am\u00e9rica, or the American cup, is the world's oldest running continental tournament, dating to 1916. It is used to determine the champion of South America, but select teams from North America and Asia have been invited to compete since the 1990s. This year, the 10 CONMEBOL teams will be joined by six Concacaf teams.\n\nThis summer's edition will be the 48 tournament and only the second time it has ever been held outside of South America. The United States also hosted Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario in 2016, a special edition of the tournament to commemorate 100 years of CONMEBOL and Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\nThe tournament is now held every four years, coinciding with the UEFA European Championship.\n\nDefending champions Argentina and Uruguay have won Copa Am\u00e9rica 15 times each, most of any country followed by Brazil (nine, last in 2019).\n\nThe tournament will be held in 14 cities across the U.S., with each location hosting two or three matches over a 25-day period. The opening match is Thursday in Atlanta and the final is July 14 in Miami. The third-place match will be in Charlotte July 13.\n\nMatches will also be played at stadiums in Arizona (Glendale); California (Santa Clara and Inglewood); Florida (Orlando and Miami); Kansas and Missouri (in Kansas City); Nevada (Las Vegas); New Jersey (East Rutherford) and Texas (Arlington, Austin and Houston).\n\nMore than 1 million tickets have been sold for 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica games, according to CONMEBOL. Tickets can be purchased at copamerica.com and other ticketing platforms.\n\nCOPA AMERICA TICKETS: Experience Copa America 2024 in person\n\nHere's the Copa Am\u00e9rica schedule for group play (June 20-July 2), round of 16 (July 4-6), semifinals (July 9 and 10), third-place (July 13) and final (July 14).\n\nBefore the 8 p.m. ET kickoff of Argentina vs. Canada at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, fans will get a show for the opening ceremony of Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\nColombian musician Feid is the opening act. He is a nine-time Latin Grammy nominee.\n\nThe U.S. men's national team begins play in Group C against Bolivia on Sunday, then Panama on June 27 and Uruguay July 1.\n\nDuring friendlies to prepare for the tournament, the U.S. played Brazil to a 1-1 draw last Wednesday, rebounding from a disappointing 5-1 defeat to Colombia.\n\nThe Americans' best Copa Am\u00e9rica finish has been fourth place, losing the third-place game in 1995 and 2016.\n\nFOX analyst Alexi Lalas says: \"I think Gregg Berhalter, the head coach, is under pressure to provide one of those seminal types of moments, and to do things that haven't been done in the past. And this group, we have put them on this pedestal, and I think fairly so because we expect them to do things that we haven't seen in the past and that people don't think can be done. And I don't think that that's unfair. But it's up to them to believe that they can do it.\"\n\nMessi and Argentina are the defending Copa Am\u00e9rica 2021 and World Cup 2022 champions, and the favorites to win this summer's Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\nMessi, the star of Inter Miami in Major League Soccer, turns 37 on June 24. He's still among the best players in the world, despite nearing the end of his illustrious career.

betting favorite to win Copa Am\u00e9rica, while the United States is tied among three teams with the fourth-best odds to win, according to BETMGM.\n\nHere's the next Top 5: Brazil (+225), Uruguay (+500), while Colombia, Mexico and the U.S. have +1200 odds.\n\nArgentina and Brazil (+225) are the oddsmakers' favorites to reach the Copa Am\u00e9rica final, to be played at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla. on July 14.\n\nThere will be 41 Major League Soccer players (including one MLS Next Pro player) in Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\nUnited States: Sean Johnson (GK, Toronto FC), Shaq Moore

The 2024 Copa America tournament kicks off Thursday for fans across North and South America. Such a huge event is going to draw enormous crowds.\n\nAfter all, this tournament is likely a look ahead to the teams that will represent North and South America in the 2026 World Cup. It's going to be difficult to find places where tickets are available, right?\n\nLuckily, there are still many places offering tickets to this summer's biggest soccer event in North America. So, if you're someone that wants to watch the U.S. Men's National Team in action, or catch Lionel Messi live before he retires in the next few years, or even someone just looking to have fun watching an international soccer match locally, there is still time.\n\nHere is where to go for last-minute tickets and what you can expect to spend.\n\nCopa Am\u00e9rica 2024: Everything you need to know. Schedule, host cities, betting odds, more\n\nThe various venues for Copa America 2024 venue are selling tickets individually for each game played at their stadium through their preferred ticket partners. Those include sites such as StubHub or SeatGeek.\n\nFor example, tickets to the United States' first match against Bolivia in Arlington, Texas are currently available on SeatGeek for as little as $57. Meanwhile, tickets to the Copa America Finals in Miami are available on StubHub with the cheapest tickets going for $689.\n\nSee Copa America Live: Shop 2024 Copa America tickets\n\nArguably the biggest draw of 2024 Copa America is Lionel Messi. With this potentially being one of Messi's last international tournaments, the draw for his games is likely at an all-time high. The ticket prices for Argentina's matches line up with that hypothesis.\n\nAs stated earlier, tickets to the United States' first match are sitting as low as $57. The cheapest tickets for Argentina's first match against Canada are $162.\n\nThose are the cheapest tickets of any of Argentina's three group stage games by the way. The lowest for Argentina vs. Chile are $278, and the lowest for Argentina vs. Peru in Miami are $324. That last one makes sense given that Messi plays for Inter Miami during MLS season.\n\nEvery Copa America game will be broadcast on either FOX Sports 1, FOX Sports 2, or FOX.

It's very difficult to imagine what can happen because it's still two years away. I don't need to commit right now to whether or not I'll be there,\" he added.\n\nWhat is certain is that Messi, who has managed his workload to try to be in peak condition for the tournament, would relish the chance to win a third straight major tournament with his country after so many years of frustration with his national team.\n\nAfter facing Canada, Argentina take on Chile in New Jersey before finishing their group A action against Peru in Miami but they know that tough opposition awaits in the knock-out stage with rivals Brazil and Uruguay the two expected challengers for the title.\n\nBrazil have struggled in CONMEBOL qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup having won just two of their opening six games and they currently sit in sixth place in the standings having lost to Uruguay, Colombia and Argentina.\n\nThere are several familiar names missing from Dorival Junior's Brazil squad with Casemiro, Gabriel Jesus and Thiago Silva left out while Richarlison and Neymar are both missing due to injury.\n\nThe pressure will be on the Real Madrid attacking pair of Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo to translate their club form into success for the Selecao while there is much excitement around the senior tournament debut of 17-year-old talent Endrick, who is set to join Real next month from Palmeiras.\n\nUruguay, also 15-times winners, have impressed under their 68-year-old Argentina coach Marcelo Bielsa, who has brought his trademark high-energy style to the team and raised expectations with recent wins over Argentina and Brazil.\n\nLiverpool forward Darwin Nunez will lead the line although Bielsa has the option of introducing veteran Luis Suarez from the bench.\n\nColombia head into the tournament without a loss in over two years and with Liverpool's livewire winger Luis Diaz a constant threat and James Rodriguez enjoying a late career revival, Nestor Lorenzo's team can't be discounted.\n\nThe USA will hope that they can generate some sorely needed excitement after losing their way since a creditable run to the last-16 at the World Cup.\n\nCoach Gregg Berhalter is under some pressure to show he can get his team, which relies on the smart wing play of Christian Pulisic, to compete with teams from outside of CONCACAF.\n\nMexico have guested frequently in the Copa in the past and reached the final in 1993 and 2001, but they look well below their usual level although they can, as always, count on huge support in the USA.\n\nThis is the second time the Copa America is being held in the USA, after the Centenary tournament in 2016, and while that is a break with tradition the presence of significant immigrant communities from all the competing nations, should ensure big crowds at the mostly NFL stadiums being used.", "source":

This guide contains information on tournament broadcasters across the world, along with free streams and details of how you can use a VPN to keep up with the action from abroad.\n\nThe Copa America kicks off on June 20, with Lionel Messi's Argentina looking to retain their title from 2021 - and it all takes place at the little genius's new stomping ground. The United States are hosting the competition, and Messi knows some of these stadiums pretty well, given that he's now a year into his Inter Miami adventure.\n\nIt's not just Messi and the Argentine squad to look out for either, with Brazil their closest rivals - as ever - and Marcelo Bielsa leading the charge with Uruguay. This one promises to be a fascinating watch, with the opportunity to watch Euro 2024 and the Copa around the clock.\n\nThe coverage is available to watch on Premier Sports in the United Kingdom, on Fox in the States and you'll even find Copa America 2024 free streams in some regions. All the details below plus FourFourTwo will be bring you all the latest news from the tournament, as the South American stars vie for supremacy.\n\nWhile the Copa America 2024 is on paid TV in most places, fans in Chile and Mexico are the lucky ones. They can watch all of the Copa America 2024 matches for free.\n\nIn Mexico, all games are on the Azteca 7 TV channel and TV Azteca Sports streaming site for free. In Chile, it's on national broadcaster Canal 13 with all Copa America 2024 live streams also available for free on the 13Go video player.\n\nTravelling abroad during the tournament? a Copa America live stream as they would back home. All you need is a quality VPN, such as NordVPN, to watch your usual free stream when overseas. Read on to find out how.\n\nIf you're out of the country for some or all of the Copa America 2024, then annoyingly your domestic on-demand services won't work - the broadcaster knows where you are because of your IP address (boo!). You'll be blocked from watching it, which is not ideal when you know you'd have free access back home, and want to watch the games without resorting to illegal feeds you've found on Reddit.\n\nBut help is at hand. All you need to do to navigate those geoblocking restrictions is buy yourself a VPN (Virtual Private Network) - assuming it complies with your broadcaster's T&Cs, of course.\n\nA VPN creates a private connection between your device and t'internet, meaning the service can't work out where you are and won't automatically block the service you've paid for. All the info going between is also entirely encrypted - and that's a result.\n\nThere are plenty of good-value options out there, but NordVPN scores particularly highly for Copa America 2024:\n\nIf you don't live in the UK, there are plenty of other places to watch Copa America 2024 live streams - including free options in Chile and Mexico.\n\nAll of the games in the UK will be shown on Premier Sports.\n\nViewers in Ireland can watch Copa America 2024 live streams on Premier Sports.\n\nIn the USA, you can watch Copa America 2024 live streams on Fox, FS1 and FS2 with English commentary.\n\nIf you don't have cable, you can use services such as Sling and FuboTV to get the Fox channels.\n\nTSN and RDS have the rights to Copa America 2024 in Canada.\n\nIf you're Down Under, Optus Sport will show all Copa America 2024 games in Australia.\n\nIn New Zealand, rights to Copa America 2024 live streams have been listed as belonging to TVNZ but there's nothing about it in the site's schedule at the minute, so you'd best take that with a pinch of salt.\n\nThere are also numerous Copa America 2024 live streams available across the world, including L'Equipe (France), DAZN (Germany) and Mola TV (Italy).\n\nRemember, if you're away from your home country during Copa America 2024, you can use a VPN to watch the action on your usual service.", "source": {"uri": "fourfourtwo.com", "dataType":

With the United States as the host, the next few weeks will be jam-packed with soccer as North American sides take on Central and South America teams in a bid to become the best team in the region. The USMNT boasts plenty of talent with Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, and Yunus Musah, among others, but can they upset international heavyweights Brazil or current World Cup titleholders Argentina?\n\nIt might also be Lionel Messi's last major tournament as the 36-year-old enters the twilight of a sparkling career. Could he help his nation to back-to-back Copa Am\u00e9rica titles? Can striker Santiago Gim\u00e9nez lead Mexico to a deep run in the tournament? Meanwhile, Brazil's Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, arguably the best winger in the world, will attract plenty of attention as he looks to become the main man for his nation.\n\nIt's all up for grabs, and though there are clear favorites, shock results are bound to happen in international soccer. ESPN previews each of the Copa Am\u00e9rica's 16 teams in the tournament, with everything you need to know about the sides, split into their groups.\n\nNickname: La Albiceleste (The White and Sky Blue)\n\nFIFA rank: 1\n\nManager: Lionel Scaloni\n\nRecord in past 12 months: 12W-0D-0L\n\nGroup stage fixtures: Canada (Thursday, 8 p.m. ET); Chile (June 25, 9 p.m. ET); Peru (June 29, 8 p.m. ET)\n\nESPN BET odds to win Copa 2024: +175\n\nCan't-miss star: \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda. Lionel Messi would be too obvious -- so it is time to pay tribute to Di Maria, who retires from international football after this tournament. The 36-year-old will be badly missed. Di Maria is that rarest of things -- a genuine world-class player who seems without ego, consistently doing what is needed to improve the team. He has been key to all Argentina's recent triumphs.\n\nBreakout candidate: Valentin Carboni. The 19-year-old seems most likely to emerge as the Di Maria replacement. Alejandro Garnacho has more pace, but the lanky left-footed Carboni has enchanted the coaching staff with his elegant quality, sufficiently versatile to cover a number of attacking positions. Born in Buenos Aires, but used to play for Italy at under-17 level.\n\nWhy they won't win it all: It is hardly a surprise that Argentina are at the top of the World Cup qualification table. They were the only team that went into the competition as a consolidated unit. The Copa gives the others a chance to catch up. Argentina, meanwhile, might have been treading water. Their friendlies this year have been too easy, teaching them little. And the big question remains unresolved: how long can the team go on with its model of Messi plus 10? Scaloni flirted with resignation last November, almost certainly provoked, at least in part, by a glimpse of the end of the Messi era. Much of the past 18 months have felt like a prolonged lap of honor after the triumph in Qatar.\n\nRealistic chances at Copa 2024: Placed in by far the easiest half of the draw, it will take a major shock for Argentina not to reach the final. As the games become more competitive, an interesting dilemma emerges. Does the status of world and Copa champions mean that the pressure is off? Or might the fact of having something to lose prove nerve-wracking? Argentina go into the tournament as justified favorites, and there will be moments when their possession-based football delights fans, with the rhythm suddenly switching as they bear down on goal. And whatever happens, they should emerge from the Copa with one aspect of their 2026 World Cup challenge enhanced. A collapse at the heart of the defense so nearly cost them the title in Qatar. The Copa is a clear opportunity to consolidate Lisandro Mart\u00ednez in the back four. -- Tim Vickery\n\nNickname: Canucks\n\nFIFA rank: 49\n\nManager: Jesse Marsch\n\nRecord in past 12 months: 4W-3D-5L\n\nGroup stage fixtures: Argentina (Thursday, 8 p.m. ET); Peru (June 25, 6 p.m. ET); Chile (June 29, 8 p.m. ET)\n\nESPN BET odds to win Copa 2024: +6600\n\nCan't-miss star: Jonathan David. Alphonso Davies is typically penciled in here, but David had the better club season, scoring 26 goals in all competitions for Ligue 1 side Lille. Davies is also slated to play left-back, which means his influence might be muted against the tough trio of South American teams -- starting with Argentina -- that comprise Group A. If Canada is to get out of the group stage, David will need to be banging in the goals.\n\nBreakout candidate: Moise Bombito. The back line has long been one of Canada's biggest weaknesses, but Bombito showed well in two recent friendlies against the Netherlands and France with his passing and speed. The Colorado Rapids defender has an opportunity to stake his claim to a starting spot and could prove to be an unlikely catalyst for Canada getting out of the group.\n\nWhy they won't win it all: There just hasn't been enough time for new manager Jesse Marsch -- who was hired last month -- to have implemented his high-pressing system and generate some cohesion. Granted, Canada did record a credible 0-0 draw against France, this after a 4-0 defeat to the Netherlands in which the Reds played well for stretches but ultimately ran out of gas. Whether that effort against France can be replicated while generating a consistent attack remains to be seen. All told, the demands of Marsch's style, as well as a talent gap when compared to the hemisphere's best teams, make it too big of an ask for Canada to come close to being a contender.\n\nRealistic chances at Copa 2024: Getting out of the group ought to be the primary goal here. On paper that's certainly doable, especially given the pace of players such as Davies and Tajon Buchanan. While Argentina are heavy favorites to top Group A, Chile and Peru are beatable. Both teams have struggled in South American World Cup qualifying, occupying eighth and 10th place respectively, but they won't be pushovers either. That will require limiting the damage in the group stage opener against the reigning World Cup and Copa America champions, and then grinding out results in the last two games. This tournament will be mostly about laying foundations ahead of the 2026 World Cup. -- Jeff Carlisle\n\nNickname: La Roja (The Red One)\n\nFIFA rank: 42\n\nManager: Ricardo Gareca\n\nRecord in past 12 months: 5W-3D-4L\n\nGroup stage fixtures: Peru (Friday, 8 p.m. ET); Argentina (June 25, 9 p.m. ET); Canada (June 29, 8 p.m. ET)\n\nESPN BET odds to win Copa 2024: +3300\n\nCan't-miss star: Alexis S\u00e1nchez. With more caps (163) and goals (51) for Chile than any other player, Sanchez is keen to point out that at 35 years old he is not a spent force. Enthused by the project of coach Ricardo Gareca, Sanchez is buzzing around behind the centre-forward, more involved these days in setting up the play than finishing off the moves.\n\nBreakout candidate: Dar\u00edo Osorio. After a long wait for another superstar, there is a cautious sense of optimism around the 20-year-old, a leggy left-footed winger who likes to cut in from the right. He had a fine season in Denmark and scored a splendid debut international goal against France in March, but is fighting to shake off a late season injury.\n\nWhy they won't win it all: Chile's second game is against Argentina in New Jersey -- same venue and same opponents as the 2016 Copa final win, the greatest moment in the history of the national team. Eight years ago seems like light years ago. Chile did not make it to either of the two subsequent World Cups and have made a bad start on the way to 2026 -- hence the recent change of coach. Theirs has been a typical South American problem: a drought of talent following a golden generation. The process of renewing the team has been extremely weak.\n\nRealistic chances at Copa 2024: Chile have pinned their faith in the \"Gareca factor\" -- the hope that Argentine coach Gareca can reproduce what he did with Peru and build a team that adds up to more than the sum of its parts. The new man has certainly made a promising start, with goals and good performances in his first three friendlies. Can this be continued now that the competitive games have come? The group looks easy enough, so Chile can expect a quarterfinal, although a semifinal would seem to be the limit of their chances. The main aim is to build momentum for the coming six rounds of World Cup qualifiers. -- Vickery\n\nNickname: La Blanquirroja (The White and Red)\n\nFIFA rank: 32\n\nManager: Jorge Fossati\n\nRecord in past 12 months: 4W-3D-5L\n\nGroup stage fixtures: Chile (Friday, 8 p.m. ET); Canada (June 25, 6 p.m. ET); Argentina (June 29, 8 p.m. ET)\n\nESPN BET odds to win Copa 2024: +5000\n\nCan't-miss star: Pedro Gallese. Peru is not known for producing goalkeepers, but they can be proud of Gallese. Over a decade in the national team and with more than 100 caps, the Orlando City keeper has been reliable and occasionally outstanding. He would walk into a best all-time Peru XI.\n\nBreakout candidate: Piero Quispe. He's is a little, skipping, give-and-go midfielder who was Peru's player of the year in 2023 and has since made an encouraging start in Mexico. Some say that he is too much of a lightweight for the top level. The Copa is a chance for him to prove them wrong and launch his international career.\n\nWhy they won't win it all: For a few years, former coach Ricardo Gareca performed a minor miracle with Peru, building a team that added up to more than the sum of its parts. Post-Gareca, things returned to normal for a country that has gone 11 years without one of its clubs reaching the knockout stage of the Copa Libertadores, and which is not producing many successful exports. Peru lie bottom of the 2026 World Cup qualification table with just one goal scored in six games. And midfielder Renato Tapia, probably the team's best outfield player, walked out following a row with the local federation. Everything seems stacked against the Peruvians.\n\nRealistic chances at Copa 2024: After a few gentle friendlies, these will be the first competitive games in the reign of the new coach, Uruguayan Jorge Fossati, who has immediately implanted his trademark three centre-back system. Fossati will probably try to focus on defensive solidity, and trust that clever attacking midfielder Edison Flores can buzz effectively around the centre-forward. The opening game with neighbors and bitter rivals Chile is crucial. In a perfect world, this Copa will be to Fossati what the 2016 version in the USA was to Gareca. Eight years ago, Peru travelled north in apparent disarray, but in the course of the competition found the group and the momentum that took them to Russia 2018 and very nearly to Qatar. -- Vickery\n\nNickname: La Tricolor (The Tricolors)\n\nFIFA rank: 31\n\nManager: F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez Bas\n\nRecord in past 12 months: 8W-2D-3L\n\nGroup stage fixtures: Venezuela (Saturday, 6 p.m. ET); Jamaica (June 26, 6 p.m. ET); Mexico (June 30, 8 p.m. ET)\n\nESPN BET odds to win Copa 2024: +1800\n\nCan't-miss star: Mois\u00e9s Caicedo. He has been bestriding the Ecuador midfield like a prince since he was a teenager, and at 22 he already has more than 40 caps to his name. He is at the heart of everything that Ecuador do, winning the ball, driving forward, linking the play with quick passes and running beyond the strikers to shoot at goal.\n\nBreakout candidate: Kendry Paez. He was making and scoring goals in World Cup qualification months before his 17th birthday. A left-footed attacking midfielder with the air of an Ecuadorian Phil Foden, he is full of surprise shots and passes at clever angles. This is an eagerly awaited first senior tournament for the Chelsea-bound wonderkid.\n\nWhy they won't win it all: Despite a solid start to their 2026 qualification campaign, pressure is mounting on Spanish coach Felix Sanchez, who was in charge of Qatar in the last World Cup. Some even speculate that this tournament might serve as a referendum on his job security. One of his problems is that the wealth of resources at centre-back is not matched by those at centre-forward. The team are highly dependent on all-time top scorer Enner Valencia, who was overplayed during 2022 and 2023, and has since been paying the price.\n\nRealistic chances at Copa 2024: Expectations in Ecuador are fluctuating wildly, from hopes of a semifinal to fears of group stage elimination. Both are possible, and plenty hangs on the opening clash with Venezuela. Pick up the points there, avoid Argentina in the quarters and a place in the last four is within the grasp of a young, physically imposing team who are not easy to play against. The key question is whether they can score enough goals, given their lack of depth at centre-forward and the absence of the strong, quick and direct wingers who have typically been a feature of recent Ecuador sides. -- Vickery\n\nNickname: Reggae Boyz\n\nFIFA rank: 55\n\nManager: Heimir Hallgr\u00edmsson\n\nRecord in past 12 months: 12W-4D-5L\n\nGroup stage fixtures: Mexico (Saturday, 9 p.m. ET); Ecuador (June 26, 6 p.m. ET); Venezuela (June 30, 8 p.m. ET)\n\nESPN BET odds to win Copa 2024: +15000\n\nCan't-miss star: Michail Antonio. With Leon Bailey out of the picture, on paper, Antonio is the star. When healthy, the West Ham United striker is brilliant in the air and a clever dribbler. So why just on paper? That's because the England native hasn't solidified himself as a reliable big-game goal scorer for Jamaica since his 2021 debut, but that could change this summer.\n\nBreakout candidate: Shamar Nicholson. A fully fit and available Jamaica roster likely wouldn't have Nicholson in the XI, but that doesn't deny the fact that he's been an invaluable striker. Soon to be heading back to Spartak Moscow after a loan with Clermont, the 27-year-old has been lights out for Jamaica with eight goals in his past seven games.\n\nWhy they won't win it all: Injuries have seriously hurt their chances, as seen in recent World Cup qualifiers where they narrowly sneaked past Concacaf minnows such as the Dominican Republic and Dominica through one-goal margins. As arguably the weakest team in their group -- and with a worrisome Copa Am\u00e9rica past that features six losses in six games -- one can argue that Jamaica may not have enough to even get out of the group stage.\n\nRealistic chances at Copa 2024: Sure, Jamaica could be seen as the worst in their group, but on the other hand, the reality is that there isn't a significant difference between all four teams. If they can at least steal a point from Mexico in their first game, and if Nicholson continues his impressive form, there's no reason they can't qualify for the knockout round. That said, there are plenty of questions regarding their roster, likely leaving them at third or fourth in Group B. -- Cesar Hernandez\n\nNickname: El Tri (The Tricolor)\n\nFIFA rank: 14\n\nManager: Jaime Lozano\n\nRecord in past 12 months: 11W-4D-8L\n\nGroup stage fixtures: Jamaica (Saturday, 9 p.m. ET); Venezuela (June 26, 9 p.m. ET); Ecuador (June 30, 8 p.m. ET)\n\nESPN BET odds to win Copa 2024: +1200\n\nCan't-miss star: Edson \u00c1lvarez. To quote West Ham supporters: \"Midfield maestro, from Mexico, Edson ole ole ole.\" For club and country, Alvarez is a rock in the heart of the XI, often doing the dirty work with crucial interventions and crunching tackles that stop opposition. At his best, the player is capable of producing defensive midfield masterclasses with his aggressive work rate and stamina.\n\nBreakout candidate: Santiago Gim\u00e9nez. Recently finishing the Eredivisie season with 23 goals, the young Feyenoord striker is a dark horse candidate for Copa Am\u00e9rica's Golden Boot award. More than just a sturdy goal scorer with surprising acceleration, the 23-year-old is also an excellent passer in the final third. Could a performance lead to a summer move to a bigger club?\n\nWhy they won't win it all: With an eye toward the 2026 World Cup, Mexico are currently in the middle of a generational change. When the tournament kicks off, many fans will be surprised to learn that high-profile veterans such as Hirving Lozano, Guillermo Ochoa and Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez were left off of the roster. During part of that process, the latest losses against Uruguay and Brazil have further strengthened the notion that head coach Jaime \"Jimmy\" Lozano and his men are still a work in progress.\n\nRealistic chances at Copa 2024: Mexico should finish in the top two of their group, especially with their status as the (slight) favorites among the four. Assuming no early hiccups and that a backup goalkeeper is able to fill the immense gloves left by Ochoa, Mexico's knockout round fate probably will be decided by if/when they potentially meet Argentina. If they meet in the quarters or semis, that's likely where they'll exit. No Argentina matchup? It then wouldn't be a stretch to see them as finalists. If Alvarez and Gimenez live up to their expectations, Mexico could make a deep run. -- Hernandez\n\nNickname: La Vinotinto (The Wine Red)\n\nFIFA rank: 54\n\nManager: Fernando Batista\n\nRecord in past 12 months: 4W-4D-3L\n\nGroup stage fixtures: Ecuador (Saturday, 6 p.m. ET); Mexico (June 26, 9 p.m. ET); Jamaica (June 30, 8 p.m. ET)\n\nESPN BET odds to win Copa 2024: +6600\n\nCan't-miss star: Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n. The tragedy of the Qatar World Cup qualifiers was that Rondon was either in China or England, and regulations stopped him going home during the COVID pandemic. Now their big centre-forward and the reference point of the attack is available, and he will want to use this Copa to show that he is not in physical decline.\n\nBreakout candidate: Kervin Andrade. There are high hopes of 19-year-old attacking midfielder Andrade, a squat little figure with close control and a rocket shot who is making a good impression in Brazil with Fortaleza. He was called up this year to the Venezuela squad and is likely to be gently introduced during the course of the tournament.\n\nWhy they won't win it all: Venezuela can cause problems to stronger sides, but they run into the problem of the underdog -- if they charge forward, their defensive unit can look vulnerable, but hanging back can leave them too timid and passive. It is not an easy balance for them to strike, and there would seem to be almost no chance of them finding the right blend over the course of six games. They are the only side in the competition who have yet to play in a World Cup, and a Venezuelan triumph on July 14 would be one of the biggest shocks in Copa history.\n\nRealistic chances at Copa 2024: For Venezuela, everything is geared around qualifying for the 2026 World Cup and making their World Cup debut. The 1-1 draw away to Brazil last October was a massive morale boost, and Argentine coach Fernando Batista will be delighted that his side have conceded just three goals in the six qualifying rounds. The priority in this Copa, then, is to emerge with faith intact. There are no real hopes of winning, and even a repeat of 2011's semifinal would be seen as a bonus. A quarterfinal would be nice, but the most important thing is that Venezuela emerge from the competition confident that they will be back in North America two years from now. -- Vickery\n\nNickname: La Verde (The Green)\n\nFIFA rank: 85\n\nManager: Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Zago\n\nRecord in past 12 months: 2W-1D-11L\n\nGroup stage fixtures: U.S. (Sunday, 6 p.m. ET); Uruguay (June 27, 9 p.m. ET); Panama (July 1, 9 p.m. ET)\n\nESPN BET odds to win Copa 2024: +15000\n\nCan't-miss star: Ramiro Vaca. He moved back home after failing to make much of an impression in Belgium with Beerschot, but he is an important player in the national team, bringing quality to the midfield with his range of passes, his well-struck shots and his set pieces. Vaca turns 25 during the competition.\n\nBreakout candidate: Diego Medina. He made a good impression at the start of the year in the South American Under-23 championships as an aggressive and athletic right-back. He is happy in the wing-back role if Bol\u00edvia go with a back three, and will look to consolidate his place in the side during the Copa.\n\nWhy they won't win it all: Thirty years ago, Bol\u00edvia went to the U.S. for the World Cup with a generation of talent that they have been utterly unable to replace. The recent retirement from international football of all-time top scorer Marcelo Martins Moreno has worsened matters still further. After last week's 3-1 defeat to Ecuador, a local newspaper delivered a damning verdict, pointing out three areas where the team urgently needs to improve: defending, retaining possession and setting up chances.\n\nRealistic chances at Copa 2024: Bol\u00edvia are frequently offered up to the hosts in the opening game in a move aimed to get the tournament off to a good start. Often they have refused to follow the script, rising to the occasion and holding out for a draw. But hopes are not high this time. There was optimism a year back, after some good results in friendlies, but all that was instantly swept away when World Cup qualification got underway. Following a disastrous start, Argentine coach Gustavo Costas gave way to Brazil's Antonio Carlos Zago, without much improvement. Qualification for the 2026 World Cup, however, is still possible -- Bol\u00edvia always look to pick up points at the extreme altitude of La Paz. Priority in this Copa is for a young side to emerge from the competition with self-esteem intact. -- Vickery\n\nNickname: La Marea Roja (The Red Tide)\n\nFIFA rank: 45\n\nManager: Thomas Christiansen\n\nRecord in past 12 months: 14W-2D-6L\n\nGroup stage fixtures: Uruguay (Sunday, 9 p.m. ET); USA (June 27, 6 p.m. ET); Bol\u00edvia (July 1, 9 p.m. ET)\n\nESPN BET odds to win Copa 2024: +15000\n\nCan't-miss star: An\u00edbal Godoy. He's a tenacious midfielder from Nashville SC who was influential in Panama's past two wins in World Cup qualifiers. In a national team career that has now stretched to 14 years, the captain with excellent distribution will be set to lead his side in yet another major tournament.\n\nBreakout candidate: Adalberto Carrasquilla. After earning the MVP award for 2023's Concacaf Gold Cup, can Carrasquilla gain even higher praise at the Copa Am\u00e9rica? Well-rounded in the midfield but also a threat when carrying the ball forward, the Houston Dynamo player will easily be one to watch. It wouldn't be a surprise if a European team took a chance on the 25-year-old after the tournament.\n\nWhy they won't win it all: Credit should be given to the gradual improvements made by manager Thomas Christiansen. The coach and his players punched above their weight with a spot at the 2023 Gold Cup final and earned a respectable place within the top four of the 2023-24 Concacaf Nations League. But against CONMEBOL opponents? That's a tough ask, and Christiansen doesn't have the depth of talent needed to go far -- let alone possibly making it out of the group stage.\n\nRealistic chances at Copa 2024: Stranger things have happened in tournament soccer, but there aren't very many scenarios in which the U.S. and Uruguay aren't in the top two of Group C. Due to the luck of the draw, Panama just happen to be in a group with two teams that are in the conversation of dark horses.\n\nThird or fourth in their group is the expectation, but if they can get at least one surprise result vs the U.S. or Uruguay, Panama might have an unexpected fighting chance to continue their run when they close out the group stage vs. a questionable Bol\u00edvia. -- Hernandez\n\nNickname: La Celeste (The Sky Blue)\n\nFIFA rank: 15\n\nManager: Marcelo Bielsa\n\nRecord in past 12 months: 8W-3D-2L\n\nGroup stage fixtures: Panama (Sunday, 9 p.m. ET); Bol\u00edvia (June 27, 9 p.m. ET); USA (July 1, 9 p.m. ET)\n\nESPN BET odds to win Copa 2024: +500\n\nCan't-miss star: Federico Valverde. He is the often overlooked quiet force of the Real Madrid team, balancing out the side with his spirit of sacrifice and extraordinary lung power. With Uruguay, he is free to shout louder. His midfield dynamism is at the heart of the side, working box to box and unleashing his ferocious shots.\n\nBreakout candidate: Facundo Pellistri. Loaned out first to Alaves and then to Granada, Pellistri has been strangely neglected by Manchester United but has enjoyed a fine time with Uruguay. The 22-year-old might have been their most effective attacking player in the Qatar World Cup as a pacy right winger with the vision of a playmaker.\n\nWhy they won't win it all: Bielsa's football is notoriously high tempo and high energy. Can the team maintain the required intensity at the end of the European season? This could be especially difficult in the intense summer heat of some of the Copa venues. As Leeds United fans will recall, when the plan goes wrong, a Bielsa team can leave itself extremely open, and in the toughest half of the draw, where there is less margin for error, this could be a problem.\n\nRealistic chances at Copa 2024: It is easy to see why Bielsa was attracted to the Uruguay job. With the old generation leaving the scene after Qatar, he had a dynamic new generation to work with; an impressive spine of Ronald Ara\u00fajo, Jose Gimenez, Manuel Ugarte, Valverde and Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez, plus the wingers Uruguay usually produces and Bielsa loves so much. They ended last year as South America's in-form side, comfortably beating Brazil and winning away to Argentina, and the recent destruction of Mexico has merely confirmed that impression. No one will relish facing them -- and 100 years after Uruguay's historic Olympic gold medal, they are candidates for a title once more. -- Vickery\n\nNickname: Stars & Stripes\n\nFIFA rank: 11\n\nManager: Gregg Berhalter\n\nRecord in past 12 months: 11W-2D-5L\n\nGroup stage fixtures: Bol\u00edvia (Sunday, 6 p.m. ET); Panama (June 27, 6 p.m. ET); Uruguay (July 1, 9 p.m. ET)\n\nESPN BET odds to win Copa 2024: +1200\n\nCan't-miss star: Christian Pulisic. Pulisic has long been the face of the USMNT, and he largely delivered at the 2022 World Cup, scoring the game winner against Iran that put the U.S. through to the knockout stages. Now he is coming off arguably his best club season, having scored 12 goals and added eight assists for AC Milan.\n\nBreakout candidate: Giovanni Reyna. Reyna is a known commodity among U.S. fans, but his club career has stalled due to a combination of injury and poor form. He has shined in recent competitions with the U.S., however, and was the Player of the Tournament at the Concacaf Nations League this past March. The Copa is a big step up, though. If the U.S. do make a deep run, they'll need Reyna at his best playing in an attacking midfield role and providing the chance creation the team needs.\n\nWhy they won't win it all: The 2022 World Cup revealed that the U.S. struggled mightily with chance creation, finishing in the bottom half in xG both among teams that reached the knockout rounds (tied for 12th) and for the tournament as a whole (23rd out of 32). Have the U.S. improved since then? Tough to say. Their only match since then against a non-Concacaf team ranked 50th or higher was a 3-1 home loss to Germany in which the visitors were far superior. Until the U.S. deliver against a top opponent, there will be doubts that their attack is good enough to push the tournament hosts into the elite.\n\nRealistic chances at Copa 2024: The U.S. have gone about managing expectations for the Copa in an odd way, talking about the opportunity in front of them while at the same time speaking of how the World Cup is the bigger priority. In a group featuring Bol\u00edvia, Panama and Uruguay, the U.S. will be expected to progress. Elimination in the group stage would be looked upon -- justifiably -- as a colossal failure, and put manager Berhalter's status under threat. If the U.S. do progress, a likely matchup with Brazil or Colombia awaits in the quarterfinals, where the USMNT would be an underdog against either side. The U.S. recently were thrashed 5-1 by Colombia before securing a credible 1-1 draw against Brazil. Getting past either of those teams seems beyond the U.S. at the moment. The play of Reyna and oft-injured holding midfielder Tyler Adams will be critical to the U.S. team's chances. -- Carlisle\n\nNickname: Sele\u00e7\u00e3o Canarinha (Canary Squad)\n\nFIFA rank: 5\n\nManager: Dorival J\u00fanior\n\nRecord in past 12 months: 5W-3D-4L\n\nGroup stage fixtures: Costa Rica (Monday, 9 p.m. ET); Paraguay (June 28, 9 p.m. ET); Colombia (July 2, 9 p.m. ET)\n\nESPN BET odds to win Copa 2024: +225\n\nCan't-miss star: Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior. In the Qatar World Cup, Vinicius was the newcomer who had only recently forced his way into the team. Things have changed. He is now Brazil's most dangerous attacking player, and to his stunning wing play he has added the capacity to operate more centrally. A good tournament could seal the Ballon D'Or this year.\n\nBreakout candidate: Endrick. The stocky, left-footed Endrick, who turns 18 in July, came off the bench in three consecutive games this year to score three goals, all of them important, all of them in different styles. The talent of the Real Madrid-bound prodigy is such that everyone will want to see how he gets on in his debut tournament.\n\nWhy they won't win it all: After a disastrous 2023 for the team, new coach Dorival Junior is attempting to steady the ship. The Copa is his competitive debut, and on the evidence of the first four friendlies, the team have yet to recover the defensive solidity that was a hallmark of the 2016-2022 Tite era. With Brazil in by far the most difficult half of the draw, they will surely be tested as they go through the competition, and it will be fascinating to find out how a young side responds under pressure.\n\nRealistic chances at Copa 2024: After winning four Copas in five between 1997 and 2007, Brazil have won only one of the past five -- and that was on home soil. Even so, they are contenders for this title. In full flow they can be an exhilarating sight, and if Vini Junior, Rodrygo and company can be well backed up by the likes of Alisson, Marquinhos and Bruno Guimar\u00e3es, then they will take some stopping. The prospect of a semifinal against Marcelo Bielsa's Uruguay is deliciously enticing. Whatever happens, Brazil should emerge from the tournament having put 2023 behind them and ready to put a swift end to any doubts about their presence in the next World Cup. -- Vickery\n\nNickname: Los Cafeteros (The Coffeemakers)\n\nFIFA rank: 12\n\nManager: N\u00e9stor Lorenzo\n\nRecord in past 12 months: 11W-3D-0L\n\nGroup stage fixtures: Paraguay (Monday, 6 p.m. ET); Costa Rica (June 28, 6 p.m. ET); Brazil (July 2, 9 p.m. ET)\n\nESPN BET odds to win Copa 2024: +1000\n\nCan't-miss star: Luis D\u00edaz. The Liverpool winger is now the undisputed king of the team, especially after those two goals that brought a first ever World Cup qualification win over Brazil last November, just days after his father had been freed from a kidnap. He'll cut in from the left and occasionally wander across the attacking line.\n\nBreakout candidate: Richard R\u00edos. He was an unknown playing futsal in Brazil where he was discovered and transformed into a dynamic part of the Palmeiras midfield that won last year's league title. The 24-year-old was successfully introduced to the national team this year and highlighted his value with a first goal for Colombia in the 5-1 rout of the USA.\n\nWhy they won't win it all: The long unbeaten run under coach Nestor Lorenzo is a cause for concern for anyone who has followed the history of the Colombian national team. Their fans will be out in force, and expectations are high, but dealing with euphoria is vital in tournament football, and this has often been a problem. Older supporters will recall that 30 years ago Colombia went to the World Cup in the USA on a run of one defeat in 33 games -- and that story ended in tragedy with a group stage exit. In by far the more difficult half of the draw, there are plenty of opportunities for their Copa campaign to go wrong.\n\nRealistic chances at Copa 2024: Lorenzo was an inspired choice to coach the side. The Argentine was a long-term assistant to Jose Pekerman, who took Colombia to the World Cups of 2014 and '18, and has an undoubted flair for the top job. Lorenzo's teams is well constructed, with attacker James Rodr\u00edguez free to float in a side that is otherwise highly structured. They know where they seek to win the ball, either sitting deep with their lines compact or pressing high. A possible problem -- and here the 5-1 win over the USA can be deceptive -- is a lack of goals. It was the reason they missed the Qatar World Cup, and although they are off to a sound start in the 2026 qualifiers they have only six goals in six games. But the semifinals certainly look like a realistic target. -- Vickery\n\nNickname: Los Ticos (The Ticos)\n\nFIFA rank: 52\n\nManager: Gustavo Alfaro\n\nRecord in past 12 months: 7W-2D-8L\n\nGroup stage fixtures: Brazil (Monday, 9 p.m. ET); Colombia (June 28, 6 p.m. ET); Paraguay (July 2, 9 p.m. ET)\n\nESPN BET odds to win Copa 2024: +8000\n\nCan't-miss star: Francisco Calvo. No Keylor Navas? No problem. Following the retirement of the iconic goalkeeper, the captain's armband has been in safe hands with Calvo in June's wins in World Cup qualifiers. Forceful in his defensive abilities but also with an eye for long passes, the presence of the FC Juarez defender will be highly significant this summer.\n\nBreakout candidate: Brandon Aguilera. Costa Rica's latest No. 10 wasn't a veteran superstar, but instead, a versatile 20-year-old Nottingham Forest player who just wrapped up a short League One loan. Earning an assist in his last Costa Rica appearance, the midfielder still has much to prove and isn't a guaranteed starter, but there's a reason he made his Premier League debut in January.\n\nWhy they won't win it all: Aguilera is a young player to keep an eye on, as is Manfred Ugalde up top, but it's difficult to see the two players and their teammates going far without the insurance plan of Navas in net. The goalkeeper was a literal savior between the sticks, and while Costa Rica's roster can likely hold their own without Navas against Concacaf opposition, the same can't be said when you throw CONMEBOL into the mix as well.\n\nRealistic chances at Copa 2024: World Cup qualifying is off to a great start and they have some future stars to look forward to, and yet, at the Copa Am\u00e9rica, Costa Rica face the unenviable task of trying to halt Brazil and Colombia in Group D. To make matters more difficult, those will be their first two opponents, possibly leaving them with a consolation match against Paraguay to close out the group stage. The consensus is that Costa Rica will suffer an early exit, although this is a good time to remind everyone that we just surpassed the 10-year anniversary of a similar Group D conversation at the 2014 World Cup when Costa Rica finished first ahead of Uruguay, Italy and England. -- Hernandez\n\nNickname: Albirroja (The White and Red)\n\nFIFA rank: 56\n\nManager: Daniel Garnero\n\nRecord in past 12 months: 3W-4D-4L\n\nGroup stage fixtures: Colombia (Monday, 6 p.m. ET); Brazil (June 28, 9 p.m. ET); Costa Rica (July 2, 9 p.m. ET)\n\nESPN BET odds to win Copa 2024: +6600\n\nCan't-miss star: Miguel Almiron. With league titles in Paraguay, Argentina and the USA plus more than five seasons in the Premier League, Almiron is Paraguay's main star. But at age 30, just two goals in competitive games for his country is a disappointing return. Might this be the moment when his speed and left foot make an impression?\n\nBreakout candidate: Julio Enciso. He made his Paraguay debut in the last Copa shortly after his 17th birthday, but has yet to make much of an impact. The Brighton striker picked up an injury and missed all of last year's World Cup qualifiers. Paraguay are desperate for him to return and kick start his international career.\n\nWhy they won't win it all: Morale is on the floor, as coach Garnero confessed after last week's 3-0 loss to Chile. Garnero replaced fellow Argentine Guillermo Barros Schelotto after a poor start to the World Cup qualification campaign, but things have yet to improve. In the six rounds, Paraguay have managed just one goal. The heyday of Roque Santa Cruz aside, a lack of firepower has been a frequent Paraguayan problem -- made worse by the impression that the current defensive unit is not as solid as some in the country's past.\n\nRealistic chances at Copa 2024: With Colombia first up followed by Brazil, the fixtures have not been kind to Paraguay. Coach Garnero came in full of attacking intentions, but it could be that his team's best bet is to defend deep and rely on traditional virtues of resilience. This is an approach better suited to tournaments than to the league format of World Cup qualification. Back in 2011, for example, Paraguay made it all the way to the final of the Copa without winning a single game and going through on penalties. Paraguay's dogged tradition means that they should never be underestimated, but it would be a surprise if they get out of the group. -- Vickery", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news",

Brazil is second-favorite at +224 while Uruguay (+500), Colombia (+1200) and Mexico (+1200) round out the top five in the 16-team tournament.\n\nArgentina and Canada are lumped with Peru and Chile in Group A. The top-two finishers in each of the four groups will advance to the eight-team knockout stage.\n\nThe top-ranked team in the world, Argentina has only consolidated its status in recent months. Lionel Scaloni's team currently sits first in CONMEBOL's qualification for the 2026 World Cup at 5-0-1. While they did suffer a shocking 2-0 home loss to Uruguay on Nov 16, they followed up with an impressive 1-0 win away at Brazil five days later.\n\nIn four friendlies since the calendar flipped to 2024, Argentina is 4-0 with wins over El Salvador (3-0), Costa Rica (3-1), Ecuador (1-0), and Guatemala (3-1), all in neutral locations in the United States.\n\nOverall, Argentina is 9-0-1 in its last ten.\n\nSince their majestic run through CONCACAF qualifying for the 2022 World Cup - when they finished at the top of the table ahead of both Mexico and USA - Canada's men's national team has been on the decline.\n\nCanada's FIFA ranking had dropped from 33rd in Feb 22 to 49th ahead of the Copa. They were stunningly knocked out of the CONCACAF Nations League playoffs by Jamaica despite winning the first leg 2-1 away and taking a 1-0 lead in the return fixture at home.\n\nA trio of second-half markers from Jamaica allowed the Reggae Boys to advance on away goals.\n\nIn preparation for the elite competition they'll face at the Copa America, Canada scheduled two exceedingly difficult friendlies in early June, falling 4-0 at the Netherlands before grinding out an impressive 0-0 draw against France.\n\nCanada's offense was uncharacteristically anemic, only generating two shots on target over the 180 minutes.\n\nCanada is just 3-3-4 overall in its last ten matches.\n\nThe projected Argentina starting 11 is similar but not identical to the squad that started the 2022 World Cup final against France. Lionel Messi and Julian Alvarez will likely be joined up front by 26-year-old Fiorentina winger Nicol\u00e1s Gonz\u00e1lez.\n\nCenter midfielder Enzo Fernandez is recovering from hernia surgery and will likely be replaced by savvy veteran Leandro Paredes in the starting 11.\n\nArgentina have kept clean sheets in five of their last six competitive fixtures, and those were (mostly) against higher-quality offenses than Canada, including Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, and Paraguay.\n\nBack on North American soil, Canada's attack should be a little more vigorous than it was in its recent European excursion, but they will still be hard-pressed to get on past Emi Martinez in the Argentine goal.\n\nExpect Argentina to win with a clean sheet against a Canadian attack that's struggling to find its footing at the moment.", "source": {"uri": "sportsbettingdime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Betting Dime"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sascha_paruk@sportsbettingdime.com", "name": "Sascha

History, all-time results in CONMEBOL soccer championship", "body": "With their victory lap at the Maracana in 2021, Argentina drew level with Uruguay as the two countries to have won the most Copa America titles.\n\nThe two teams from the Rio de la Plata have been crowned champions 15 times each and, in 2024, they will seek a new trophy in the United States.\n\nLionel Messi is expected to captain the team as they look to defend their continental prize. After years of final heartbreak, including in consecutive years in 2015 and 2016, Messi finally tasted Copa America glory three years ago at the most famous stadium of their old rivals, Brazil. A year later, they won the Word Cup for the first time since the days of Diego Maradona, cementing Messi's place in the pantheon of the very greatest players in history.\n\nThe defending champions will begin the tournament with the opening game against Canada in Atlanta, with further Group A matches to come against Peru and Chile. They are, as ever, one of the clear favourites to go all the way.\n\nBelow is a review of all Argentina's titles at the Copa America, including those won during the tournament's previous era as the South American Championship.\n\nArgentina have won the Copa America 15 times. Their titles came in 1921, 1925, 1927, 1929, 1937, 1941, 1945, 1946, 1947, 1955, 1957, 1959, 1991, 1993, and 2021.\n\nIt should be clarified that the three most recent of those wins came with the tournament under its current guise, while the first 12 were when the competition was called the South American Championship.\n\nOf their 15 titles, six came at home tournaments (1921, 1925, 1929, 1937, 1946, and 1959), while Chile is the other country at which Argentina have celebrated most often: they won there in 1941, 1945, 1955, and 1991.\n\nIn addition, they have won twice in Peru and Ecuador, and the most recent (2021) was in Brazil.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R\u00edo_de_la_Plata", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "R\u00edo de la Plata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maracan\u00e3_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maracan\u00e3 Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diego Maradona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peru"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Peru"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Kuk_Sool_Won", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Kuk Sool Won", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-03/Messi%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica%20Argentina%20Campe%C3%B3n%20%282%29%20%283%29.jpg?itok=C6kKSLzm", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658543", "eventUri": "eng-9658543", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Can anyone stop Messi and Argentina? Let's see...\n\nWhile his move five time zones to the west to play in the MLS in 2023 means fewer opportunities for European fans to watch the maestro in action, Messi has been in typically stellar form in his first full season in the US.\n\nHe has scored 14 goals and provided 11 assists in just 15 appearances so far this season for Inter Miami across the MLS and CONCACAF Champions Cup.\n\nMessi missed Argentina's March friendly games against El Salvador and Costa Rica due to a hamstring injury but returned off the bench in the 1-0 win over Ecuador on June 10 and then started, and ran the show, in the 4-1 win over Guatemala in their final warm-up match on Saturday, scoring twice and assisting another to make it 108 goals in 182 caps for his country.\n\nIt's not just Messi, Argentina are packed with experience and Angel Di Maria netted against Costa Rica and Ecuador, taking the 36-year-old within four goals of a certain Diego Maradona on the list of all-time Argentina scorers.\n\nEmi Martinez, Cristian Romero, Lisandro Martinez, Enzo Fernandez, Alexis MacAllister, Julian Alvarez, Lautaro Martinez, Alejandro Garnacho... the names are familiar and they have a culture of success which began with that historic Copa America win against Brazil in 2021.\n\nDi Maria scored the only goal in the Maracana that day to end a 28-year title drought and give Lionel Scaloni his first senior silverware as a coach and give Messi some revenge for the 3-0 humbling their rivals inflicted on Argentina in the final of his first Copa America in 2007.\n\nThey'll be desperate to keep the momentum going and shine in the twilight of Messi's incredible career.\n\nBrazil - The obvious choice, Argentina's fiercest rivals and closest challengers for the title, according to the bookmakers at least.\n\nHowever Brazil feel like a team in flux. They lost to Colombia and were beaten at home by Argentina before Christmas. They can't be written off and have reached the last two finals but coach Dorival Junior is yet to convince and their hopes appear to rest firmly on the shoulders of Real Madrid star Vinicius Junior, though teenage star Endrick might share some of the limelight.\n\nThere's no Neymar, remember, and Gabriel Jesus, Richarlison and the experience of Thiago Silva and Casemiro have been left out. If Vini Jr wants to put the icing on the Ballon d'Or cake after a glorious year in Madrid then lifting his first international trophy is surely the best way to do it.\n\nUruguay - Former Argentina boss Marcelo Bielsa has done what he does, he has built a team which is more than the sum of its parts and they need to be respected.\n\nArgentina and Uruguay are locked on 15 Copa America titles apiece, more than any other nation, how they would love to get one over their old rivals and land this one.\n\nThey do have the slightly unknown quantity of the USA in their group, along with gritty Panama, but once the knockouts are here they will surely take some stopping. Only penalties denied them a semi-final match-up with Argentina in Brazil three years ago.\n\nColombia - The Colombians might have missed out on a place in the Qatar 2022 World Cup but they are making up for lost time and go into the tournament on the back of a 22-match unbeaten run.\n\nThey only lost to Argentina on penalties in the 2021 semi-final, having ousted Uruguay on spot-kicks in the last eight. Fine margins in this competition, but with Luis Diaz up top and Davinson Sanchez and Bologna's Jhon Lucumi at the back, anything is possible on their day.\n\nThere shouldn't be complacency in the Argentine ranks, however, Messi himself told Argentinian TV on Tuesday: \"Today we can say that we're the best, but that doesn't mean we're going to win it easily.\n\n\"It's going to be very evenly matched, all the teams are very tough.\"\n\nWell, the 2026 World Cup is in now familiar surroundings for Messi. The United States, Canada and Mexico will co-host the tournament across 16 cities, with the action now less than two years away.\n\nYou can bet on Argentina being there, but will Messi still be going strong when the tournament kicks off just two weeks before his 39th birthday?\n\nThe man himself told Argentine channel America TV on Tuesday: \"I don't know what's going to happen two years from now, I don't know how I'm going to be physically, if I'm going to be able to continue contributing, that's why I don't know if I'm going to be there.\n\n\"I live day by day and I don't think about what might happen. Even though age is a number, I feel very good.\"\n\nArgentina begin their Group A campaign against Canada at Atlanta's Mercedes Benz Stadium in the early hours of Friday morning (1am BST).\n\nTheir second group game against Chile is at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey at 2am BST on Wednesday, June 26, while they complete their group stage against Peru in Miami's Hard Rock Stadium on June 30th at 1am BST.\n\nIf they top their group Argentina would face the team which finishes second in Group B, potentially Mexico or Ecuador, in the quarter-final at NRG Stadium, Houston, on July 5th (2am BST).\n\nThe semi-final would be back in New Jersey on July 10 (1am BST) and would see them play against either the team which finished as runner-up in their own group or the team which finished top of the group featuring Mexico and Ecuador.\n\nAll the while Brazil, Uruguay, Colombia and the USA will be battling it out in the other half of the draw, trying to secure a place in the final, back in Miami, on July 14.\n\nMessi had to wait 14 years to get his hands on the Copa America trophy, now he's done it once, don't expect him to give up that feeling easily.\n\nThe Final is in Miami, Messi's new home town. The script would seem to be written. It would be a staggering shock if Argentina were not there.\n\nIf they face Brazil or Uruguay in the showpiece on the night of July 14th, however, anything could happen in a one-off game on neutral territory (even if Messi is the new King of Miami). However the experience and confidence of Messi and his men should prove enough to see them win back-to-back titles and become the most decorated side in continental competition history.", "source":

Six North American teams and ten South American teams will be competing for the title.\n\nWith the 2026 World Cup taking place in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, this year's Copa America could be a good indicator as to the type of atmosphere we can expect in two years. It could also be a great test for the North American teams against some of the world's most elite competition.\n\nThe U.S. Men's National Team will face its first real test since the 2022 World Cup, and perhaps some surprises are in store.

Each team will earn three points for a win, one point for a draw, and zero points for a loss.\n\nOnce each team has played every other member of their group once, the top two teams will advance to the knockout stage - three rounds of single-elimination matches that cannot end in ties. If the score is tied after 90 minutes, the game will go into two 15-minutes halves. If it is still tied afterwards, the game will go to penalties.\n\nNo.\n\nIn 2021 (the most recent tournament), there were only ten teams involved in this tournament. Two groups of five participated, and only the last place finisher in each group failed to advance to the knockout stages.\n\nSince 1993, when nations outside of South America were invited to participate in the tournament, it is most common for 12 teams to compete. 2016 is the only other time 16 teams competed.\n\nThe channels for each game are listed in the schedule above.

The third-most watched international soccer tournament in the world -- behind FIFA World Cup and UEFA EURO -- is set to commence its 48th edition on June 20, with 16 teams from CONMEBOL and CONCACAF clashing in 14 venues across the United States.\n\nAs we count down the hours to see Lionel Messi, Vinicius Jr., and Co. in action in the US, let's quickly jog our Copa America statistics, starting with the most successful nations in the competition's illustrious history. Continue reading to check out the five teams that have the most Copa America honors to their name.\n\nKicking off this list are the mighty Chile, who have won the illustrious tournament twice in their history. Their victories came in consecutive editions of the tournament in 2015 and 2016, both times on penalties against heavyweights Argentina.\n\nChile have reached the Copa America semi-finals a total of 22 times. They have finished second four times, third five times, and fourth on a whopping 11 occasions.\n\nLevel on Chile with titles won, two-time Copa America victors Paraguay are in fourth place. The fallen giants of South American soccer have edged out Chile due to their higher number of runners-up finishes, with them claiming the silver medal on six occasions. Paraguay also have seven bronze medals to their name.\n\nParaguay's last Copa America triumph came 45 years back in 1979. They contested the two-legged final against Chile, beating them 3-0 at home and then losing 1-0 away. A third match was organized at a neutral venue but the game ended goalless at the end of extra time. With nothing separating the two, Paraguay won the title due to their aggregate score (3-1).\n\nArguably the finest international team in history, Brazil have won a record five FIFA World Cups. However, they have not been nearly as dominant in Copa America. So far, the Selecao have conquered the continent nine times, which is poor by their lofty standards. They have lost 12 finals and finished third on seven occasions.\n\nBrazil last won the Copa America in 2019. At the iconic Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, they claimed a 3-1 win over Peru in an engrossing final. Everton, Gabriel Jesus, and Richarlison scored one goal each for the home side.\n\nOne of the grittiest South American soccer teams on the planet, Uruguay are in second place. They have lifted the cup an impressive 15 times, including the first one in 1916. They also have six runners-up medals and nine third-placed finishes.\n\nUruguay have not won the competition since 2011. That year, they beat Paraguay 3-0 in the final, thanks to Luis Suarez's sensational strike and a brilliant Diego Forlan brace.\n\nReigning champions Argentina are the most successful nation in the history of Copa America. They have won the competition a whopping 15 times, finished runners-up on 14 occasions, claimed the bronze medal five times, and finished fourth two times. In total, they have reached the semi-finals an impressive 36 times, more than any other nation in history.\n\nIn Copa America 2021, Argentina beat arch-rivals Brazil 1-0 in the final. Angel Di Maria scored the winner in the 22nd minute to secure La Albiceleste's first Copa victory since 1993.", "source": {"uri": "sportslens.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportslens.com"},

The emerging star is 17-year-old Endrick, who joins Real Madrid this summer.\n\n\"If you look at every position in their proposed starting 11, it's probably one of the world's best players,\" U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter said.\n\nSpain is the only nation to win three consecutive major titles: the European Championship in 2008 and 2012 around the 2010 World Cup.\n\nA look at the tournament:\n\nExpanded fieldThere will be 16 teams, just as in 2016. The U.S., Mexico, Canada, Costa Rica, Panama and Jamaica join the 10 South American nations after qualifying from North and Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nBack in the USAEcuador was to host the tournament under the rotation of CONMEBOL, South American soccer's governing body, but declined. The tournament was then moved to the U.S., which also hosted the special centennial Copa America in 2016 as Chile won on penalty kicks over Argentina at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\nEleven NFL stadiums are being used, including eight of the 11 U.S. venues for the 2026 World Cup, plus three smaller MLS homes. The final will be at Miami Gardens, Florida, on July 14, starting five hours after the European Championship final in Berlin.\n\nCONMEBOL says more than 1 million tickets have been sold for the 32 matches. The 2016 tournament drew just under 1.5 million, and the 2019 tournament in Brazil about 850,000. The 2021 Copa was played mostly without fans because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nU.S. teamThis will be the biggest test for the U.S. team before the World Cup -- the Americans get an automatic berth as co-host along with Mexico and Canada -- and most Europe-based players are expected to skip next year's CONCACAF Gold Cup.\n\nChristian Pulisic, Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie are the core of a team that returns 18 players from the 2022 World Cup roster.\n\n\"A World Cup on home soil is the biggest thing that you know we'll probably do in our career,\" Pulisic said. \"It's a special time for this sport in America.\"\n\nWorld Cup test? In 2016, CONMEBOL partnered with the U.S. Soccer Federation, which was in charge of most of the logistics. This time, CONMEBOL is co-organizing the tournament with CONCACAF, the governing body of North and Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nUnlike during the World Cup, the organizers have only short-term access to venues. At Hard Rock, a concert is scheduled for July 6, between the last group stage game and the final, and a new grass surface will be installed.\n\nAt MetLife Stadium, where a semifinal will be played July 9, staff will look at it as a preview for the World Cup final on July 19, 2026. The stadium has a camera system designed by Arecont Vision and managed by Genetec Security Center that was installed before the 2014 Super Bowl and a new system by Axis Communications is being put in place this summer in the seating bowl with 80 8K, 41-megapixel cameras.\n\n\"We can see every seat all the time. I think it serves as a good deterrent,\" said Daniel DeLorenzi, vice president of security and safety services. \"We have three drone detection systems. ... Not only can we track the drone, but more importantly, we can track where the operator is.\" (AP)", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [],

And winning.\n\nThey beat Guyana 2-0 on June 7 and then recorded a 3-1 victory over Montserrat three days later.\n\nPanama have shown in recent years that they are no easy opponent on the international stage, as last year's shoot-out victory over the USMNT at the Gold Cup proved. Getting out of a group that includes Uruguay and the host nation will require a major upset, though.\n\nMORE ON THE COPA AMERICA FROM F365\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Copa America: 13 host cities ranked on 'soccer' interest from indifferent to ignited\n\n\ud83d\udc49 All 41 Premier League players in Copa America squads, including Man Utd pair and Paqueta\n\n14) Venezuela (12)\n\nVenezuela's last win came back in October last year against a Chile side who were reduced to 10 men for the final half-hour of their World Cup qualifier meeting. Their most recent outing was a 0-0 draw with Guatemala in March.\n\nFernando Batista's side are strong defensively. Scoring is their problem. Their most likely source of goals at the Copa America will be veteran striker Salomon Rondon. The former West Brom and Everton man has been outstanding for Pachuca in Mexico, scoring 21 goals in 28 games this season, including a brace in a 3-0 victory over FC Cincinnati in the CONCACAF Champions Cup final earlier this month.\n\n13) Costa Rica (15)\n\nArgentina are the only side to have beaten Costa Rica in 2024. In six matches this year, Gustavo Alfaro's side have racked up four wins. The only other side to keep them from victory are Uruguay, with whom the Costa Ricans drew 0-0 earlier this month.\n\nThe draw for the Copa America group stage has not been kind to Costa Rica, though, pitting them against Brazil and Colombia. And they will be without their biggest star at the tournament. Former Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Kaylor Navas retired from international football last month at the age of 37.\n\n12) Jamaica (13)\n\nLike Panama and Costa Rica, Jamaica have also been locked in the serious business of World Cup qualification this month. And like Panama and Costa Rica, they have also posted a 100% win rate from their two fixtures.\n\nThe Reggae Boyz have played recorded a 1-0 victory over the Dominican Republic and a 3-2 win over Dominica.\n\nIn a group with Ecuador, Venezuela and Mexico at the Copa America, the odds are against Jamaica making it to the quarter-finals, but they boast Premier League quality in the form of West Ham's Michail Antonio and Fulham's Bobby Decordova-Reid and are coming off a third-place finish in the CONCACAF Nations League. Dark horses?\n\n11) Paraguay (11)\n\nThere is plenty of talent within Daniel Garnero's Paraguay squad. Newcastle midfielder Miguel Almiron, who will be playing in his third Copa America, provides Premier League quality; as does Brighton's exciting 20-year-old forward Julio Enciso. And Diego Gomez, an Inter Miami team-mate of Lionel Messi, has impressed in MLS this season, too.\n\nFor all their ability, though, results have been hugely disappointing. A 1-0 win over Panama in their final pre-Copa warm-up friendly was Paraguay's first win since they beat Bolivia 1-0 back in October. Earlier this month, they were thrashed 3-0 by Chile and drew 0-0 with Peru.\n\n10) Canada (10)\n\nHeadlined by Lille striker Jonathan David and Bayern Munich left-back Alphonso Davies, Jesse Marsch's Canada squad possesses two of the most talented and sought-after young players at the Copa America. After the star pair, though, the level of quality drops off, making the Canadians one of the most lopsided teams in the tournament and thus difficult to judge in terms of their prospects.\n\nCanada's form going into the Copa gives little indication of their direction of travel, too. They've won just one of their last seven games, but a 0-0 draw with Euro 2024 favourites France on June 9 shows the potential for them to punch above their weight against top opposition.\n\n9) Peru (9)\n\nLike their Group A opponents Canada, Peru are another team who are difficult to figure out as the Copa America gears up. They won just one of 10 fixtures in 2023, but they have recovered from that dismal run with three wins and a draw in their four games so far in 2024.\n\nThe strength of opposition they have faced this year - Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, Paraguay and El Salvador - detracts somewhat from how impressive those results can be deemed.\n\n8) Chile (8)\n\nChile won back-to-back Copa America titles in 2015 and 2016 and have not failed to get out of the group stage in two decades. Making it to the knockout rounds this year, however, will prove extremely difficult for Ricardo Gareca's men, who have been drawn in a group with Argentina, Canada and Peru.\n\nDario Osorio, the 20-year-old FC Midtjylland winger, is one of the most exciting young players at the tournament. At the other end of the age spectrum, captain and former Manchester City goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, 41, and ex-Arsenal and Manchester United star Alexis Sanchez, 35, provide a link to past Copa glory.\n\nResounding 3-0 victories over Albania and Paraguay and a narrow 3-2 loss to France in their last three fixtures show La Roja have plenty of firepower.\n\n7) Mexico (6)\n\nWhen Mexico beat Bolivia 1-0 in a pre-Copa friendly on June 1, it looked like they might be about to build on a recent run to the final of the CONCACAF Nations League, in which they were beaten by the United States in March.\n\nBut since then they have lost both of their final two friendlies ahead of the tournament, soundly beaten 3-0 by Uruguay and then edged out 3-2 by Brazil.\n\nIn Feyenoord striker Santiago Gimenez, they have one of the rising stars of European football. The Argentina-born poacher scored 26 goals in 41 games this past season, leading to reported interest from Arsenal, Liverpool and Real Madrid. But he has been unable to translate his scoring form to the international stage, with just four goals from 27 caps.\n\nWith an expected strong support from fans travelling up from south of the border and placed in a group with Jamaica, Ecuador and Venezuela, Mexico should qualify for the knockout rounds.\n\n6) Ecuador (7)\n\nEcuador are one of the hottest teams in South America at the moment. Since being eliminated from the 2022 World Cup at the group stage, they have lost only four times in 15 games - twice to Argentina by a 1-0 scoreline, once to European champions Italy and once in a double-header against Australia in which they won the return fixture.\n\nIn that time, they've beaten Uruguay in a World Cup qualifier and recorded a credible draw with Colombia. In their two most recent Copa warm-ups, they beat Bolivia 3-1 and Honduras 2-1.\n\nFelix Sanchez Bas' side are one of the most intriguing teams in the tournament for the make-up of their squad, which is full of talent and has a wide age range.\n\nFormer West Ham striker and all-time leading scorer Enner Valencia, who is now 34 and captains the team, will lead the line. Their midfield is patrolled by \u00a3115 million Chelsea star Moises Caicedo. And in Stamford Bridge-bound 17-year-old Kendry Paez they have one of the Copa's most exciting youngsters.\n\n5) United States (5)\n\nThe USMNT's crushing 5-1 loss to Colombia threatened to derail their Copa America preparations, with calls from some quarters for head coach Gregg Berhalter to be dismissed.\n\nBut Christian Pulisic and co. responded with a thoroughly credible 1-1 draw with Brazil in their last warm-up game, a match in which they looked wholly comfortable up against some of the biggest stars of South American football.\n\nBerhalter fielded an all-Europe-based starting line-up against Colombia, the first time in USMNT history the side had been comprised entirely of players plying their trade overseas. With the likes of Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Chris Richards, the USMNT is arguably more talent-rich than ever before.\n\nREAD: USMNT squad ranked from chili dog to bison's backside ahead of Copa America\n\n4) Colombia (4)\n\nAfter extending their remarkable undefeated run that dates back to February 2022 with a 3-0 victory over Bolivia in their final preparatory fixture, Nestor Lorenzo's Colombia are the form team of the Copa America.\n\nTheir streak of 23 matches without a loss includes impressive victories over Brazil, Germany and Spain. And on June 8 they indicated their readiness for a deep run in the Stateside South American championship by smashing the USMNT 5-1.\n\nStar man James Rodriguez, now 32 and playing his club football in Brazil with Sao Paulo, has rediscovered a level of form that has eluded him for much of the last five years, while Liverpool winger Luis Diaz is the team's dynamic attacking focal point.\n\n3) Brazil (2)\n\nAfter finishing runners-up to Messi and Argentina on home soil in the last edition of the Copa America, Brazil will be determined to banish the painful memory of that defeat at the Maracana by going all the way in the USA.\n\nBut the form they are carrying into the tournament doesn't inspire great confidence in the five-time World Cup winners. They scraped past Mexico 3-2 on June 9 and then looked disjointed in a 1-1 draw with the USMNT.\n\nA cruciate knee ligament rupture means Neymar is not part of manager Dorival Junior's Copa squad. The Selecao still boast an abundance of talent, led by Real Madrid trio Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo and teenage sensation Endrick, but they've now won just twice in their last eight games.\n\n2) Uruguay (3)\n\nUruguay's stock is rising in the run-up to the 2024 Copa America. They have lost just once in their last eight games and are the last team to beat Argentina, scoring a 2-0 win over the world champions La Bombonera in Buenos Aires back in November.\n\nMarcelo Bielsa's side will begin the tournament on a high after smashing Mexico 4-0 in their final warm-up game on June 6, with Liverpool's Darwin Nunez twice on the scoresheet.\n\nAnd the form of the Reds' striker could be key to Uruguay's hopes of a first South American championship since 2011. Nunez has scored five goals in his last four appearances for the Celeste.\n\n1) Argentina (1)\n\nAfter looking a little sluggish in a 1-0 friendly victory over Ecuador on June 10, tournament favourites Argentina recorded a morale-boosting 4-0 thrashing of Guatemala in their final warm-up fixture.\n\nLionel Messi and Lautaro Martinez were both on the scoresheet in that one, and if the Albiceleste's star forwards keep their scoring boots on for the Copa America, there'll be no stopping the defending champions.\n\nLionel Scaloni's side have a few key men very much in the twilight of their careers, but they have young legs, too, in the likes of Alexis Mac Allister, Enzo Fernandez, Julian Alvarez, Alejandro Garnacho and Martinez. They have lost just once in eight fixtures since lifting the World Cup in Qatar a year and a half ago.", "source": {"uri": "football365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Football News -"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_baldi@football365.com", "name": "Ryan Baldi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Costa Rica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Costa Rica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paraguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Paraguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peru"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Peru"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Panama"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Panama"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bolivia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bolivia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Cincinnati", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Cincinnati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF_Nations_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CONCACAF Nations League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salom\u00f3n_Rond\u00f3n", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF_Gold_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CONCACAF Gold Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.F._Pachuca", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "C.F.

Schedule and regular cycle for CONMEBOL tournament", "body": "Heading towards half a century of tournaments, the Copa America is a staple of South American football, and has been extended to the rest of the Americas in recent decades.\n\nWith Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil as the traditional powerhouses throughout the history of the competition, continental domination has become one of the main objectives -- just behind the World Cup -- for any team from the region.\n\nBut exactly how often is the tournament played, and what is the schedule for how it fits in on the overall football calendar? The Sporting News has the answers.\n\nThe Copa America is held every 4 years, although for different reasons, in the last decade there have been several exceptions to that rule.\n\nMORE: Full schedule of matches for Copa America 2024 in USA\n\nOne of those involved the holding of the Copa America Centenario in 2016, just a year after the competition was held in Chile. In that case, organizers CONMEBOL scheduled a special edition to mark the 100th anniversary of the competition, with the first edition held in Argentina in 1916.\n\nLike this year's showpiece, that centenary tournament was held in the United States.\n\nIn the early years, the Copa was held far more regularly, sometimes annually, and in 2019 and 2020 it was also scheduled that there would be two consecutive Copas. That was in order to try and align the schedule with the dates of the European Championship. However, both the Copa America and the Euros were eventually moved to 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic .\n\nBoth CONMEBOL and UEFA ultimately respected the planned four-year cycle of their tournaments, largely to keep in line with playing them in between each World Cup, and the latest editions take place three years since the last ones, both starting in June 2024.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Americas"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sporting_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sporting News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica_Centenario", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Competitions", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-01/nba-plain--3f153f14-6c6c-42d1-93c1-e92cb34c3fb0.png?itok=VHVpfcAB", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658543", "eventUri": "eng-9658543", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Scaloni highlighted that playing CONCACAF teams is equally challenging. Despite past accomplishments, Scaloni stressed the importance of enjoying the game and playing to their full potential.\n\nWorld Cup winners Argentina must put recent success behind them when they begin their Copa America title defence, coach Lionel Scaloni said on Wednesday ahead of their opening game against Canada. The tournament brings together 10 South American teams and six from North and Central America and the Caribbean in the second Copa hosted by the United States.\n\nScaloni said his team must raise their game to win the title again, as facing CONCACAF teams was no easier than playing a European or South American sides. \"We are talking about things that have already passed. (Winning the World Cup and the Copa America) was very nice but it's over,\" the Argentine manager told a news conference.\n\n\"Football matches are all different, there are no easier games than others. A lot of things can happen. The difficulty of France, Brazil or Canada can be the same. \"It will be a difficult Copa America as always, we are prepared for what is to come. We are doing well, with clear ideas and knowing the difficulty of this tournament.\"\n\nAhead of their opening match against Canada on Thursday, the 46-year-old said enjoying the game had been the key to his team's success after failing to win the 2015 and 2016 Copa finals and a semi-final exit in 2019. \"Beyond the titles, we have enjoyed a lot. It's a pleasure to watch how (the players) give their all,\" he said. \"That leads to being able to achieve things. We have shown that even if we didn't win like in 2019, we were able to continue and show you can do things.\n\nArgentina also take on Peru and Chile in Group A.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Scaloni", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Scaloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CONCACAF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peru"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Peru"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/30_05_2024_04_51_28_3919746.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658543", "eventUri": "eng-9658543", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Barricades and police officers along Peachtree Street protecting the back entrance of the Westin Hotel, and a giant throng of fans in Messi jerseys surrounding an empty charter bus, waiting for a chance to get a glimpse of their beloved hero.\n\nThe scheduled training session was four hours away, but fans were camped out, desperate to see the team board the bus.\n\nEdy and Ana Alonzo, natives of Guatemala, drove from North Augusta, South Carolina on Tuesday with their sons, Hop, 10, and Marco Tulio, 5, who has been obsessed with Messi from the time he could walk. They have been sitting on folding chairs for four hours, hoping to see Messi. They waited three hours on Monday but had no luck, so they returned for another try.\n\nHow long will they stay? \"Until we see him, because I think my son loves Messi more than he loves me,\" Alonzo joked.\n\nTheir eldest daughter spent $1,800 to buy Edy and Marco Tulio a pair of tickets to the game at Mercedes-Benz Stadium (8 p.m., FS1).\n\nThe fervor for Messi and the Argentina team is on full display as Copa America gets underway.\n\nYerba mate has replaced Coca-Cola as the drink of choice in downtown Atlanta this week, and Argentina's iconic sky blue and white striped jerseys far outnumber Atlanta United's black, red and gold striped jerseys.\n\nMessi and his World Cup champion Argentina teammates begin defense of their Copa America title and tens of thousands of diehard fans have flocked here from Buenos Aires, Miami, and all over the United States to see what will likely be Messi's last time playing in the prestigious tournament.\n\n\"Hands down, Argentina has the most fans traveling for Copa America,\" said Antonio Paz, a partner at Absolut Sport, the official travel partner for the tournament. \"Eighty percent of the packages we sold have been for fans coming from Argentina. They are traveling to all three Argentina group games in Atlanta, Miami and New York/New Jersey. Many are also buying tickets for the quarterfinals, semifinal and the final at Hard Rock Stadium.\"\n\nNorberto Torres is among the Argentinean tourists. The 37-year-old from Buenos Aires flew to Atlanta via Miami on Thursday with his father and nephews. From Atlanta they will go to New York for Argentina's second group stage game against Chile and then on to Miami for the June 29 game against Peru at Hard Rock Stadium.\n\nTorres has racked up a lot of frequent flier miles following La Albiceleste (sky blue and white). He attended previous Copa America finals in Chile and the United States, and World Cups in South Africa, Brazil and Qatar.\n\nMore than 40,000 Argentineans traveled 8,200 miles to Qatar for the 2022 World Cup, despite inflation approaching 100 percent. There were reports of fans who sold their cars and emptied their savings accounts to make the trip. It is common to see fans with giant tattoos of Messi.\n\n\"The passion began before Messi, with Diego Maradona,\" Torres said. \"When you're a little kid in Argentina and people ask you what you want to be, you say, 'World Champion.' Our love of futbol is in our blood. The Copa America is the tournament we have won more than any other, so it means a lot to our fans.\"\n\nTickets for Argentina's games are the hottest sellers of the 16-team tournament, being played at 14 stadiums across the United States.\n\nAccording to StubHub, Copa America has an average ticket price of $283 this year making it 98 percent more in-demand than the tournament was back in 2016 the last time the U.S. was host. Argentina is the most in-demand team with an average ticket price of $462, and the matchup between Argentina and Peru at Hard Rock Stadium is the hottest matchup of Copa America with an average ticket price of $519, and the best deal being $318.\n\nSeveral hundred Argentine fans who traveled from South Florida planned to meet up with Argentine supporter groups from other U.S. cities. Among their meeting points, a pep rally in the West End of the city co-hosted by the Argentine consulate in Atlanta.\n\nChris Moramarco, co-founder of Inter Miami supporter group Vice City, was one of the organizers of the South Florida trip to Atlanta. He is from Rosario, Argentina, the same hometown as Messi and Inter Miami coach Tata Martino, and his soccer roots run deep. His uncle, Federico Vairo Moramarco, played for the Argentine national team in the 1957 Copa America and the 1958 World Cup.\n\nMoramarco has an impressive collection of Argentine soccer memorabilia, including a piece of the goal net from the Qatar final game.\n\n\"You can't really explain what the team means to people from our country,\" he said. \"No matter what tickets cost, Argentineans find a way to be there.\"\n\nInter Miami radio announcer Fernando Fiore, a native of Argentina, said fans of the team are more passionate than ever because of the Copa and World Cup wins, and the possibility that Messi is nearing the end of his career.\n\n\"He has fewer days ahead than behind, so people want to enjoy and be part of this long swan song, this last Messi dance,\" Fiore said.\n\nJuan Jose Montes, a Colombia native who lives in Columbus, Georgia, was among the fans hanging around Argentina's hotel on Wednesday, with his son, Jeronimo. They wore Colombia jerseys but carried Messi shirts and posed for photos in front of a Messi banner outside the Westin.\n\n\"To watch Messi, the greatest player, with a team like Argentina, is brilliant to see those of us who love futbol,\" Montes said. \"Even though we are Colombian and rooting for our team to win, we also appreciate Messi and the Argentine style of game. And, it may be the last time he plays Copa America, so this is a moment you can't miss.\"", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Defending champions and record 15-time winners Argentina will kick off the competition on Thursday night (June 20), taking on Canada at the Mercedez-Benz Stadium in Atalanta. Over the following weeks, the best 16 teams across CONMEBOL and CONCACAF will battle it out to reach the final and lift the coveted trophy at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami on July 14.\n\nCopa America 2024 will give the up-and-coming stars the perfect opportunity to set down the marker, show that they are well and truly ready to take the baton from Lionel Messi and Co. Some players will feel the weight of responsibility more than others, thanks to their exploits in club soccer and lofty price tag.\n\nToday, we will check out some players who will have to justify their sky-high market valuation in the three-week-long extravaganza. Continue reading to meet the five most valuable players participating in the 2024 Copa America, and check out how they have fared so far for their respective countries.\n\nValuation via: Transfermarkt\n\nManchester City ace Julian Alvarez is the first name on the list, with the young attacker carrying a lofty \u20ac90 million ($96.56 million) price tag. The Argentine center-forward has only played one Copa America game in his career. He had a 34-minute cameo as La Albiceleste claimed a 4-1 win over Bolivia in their final Group A game in 2021.\n\nThe two-time Premier League winner has played 31 matches for Argentina so far, scoring seven times and providing an assist. Interestingly, four of his seven strikes came in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, including a brace in the 3-0 win over Croatia in the semi-final. He also played his heart out in the final, helping Lionel Messi fulfill his lifelong ambition of winning the World Cup.\n\nInter Milan and Argentine star Lautaro Martinez is worth a staggering \u20ac110 million ($118.01 million). The 26-year-old center-forward has already played 10 games in the Copa America, scoring five times.\n\nMartinez, who made his Argentina senior-team debut on March 27, 2018, has played 58 international matches thus far. He has registered 24 goals and eight assists. However, unlike Alvarez, Martinez has not had a chance to shine for Argentina in the World Cup. He started in only two games (six matches total) for La Albiceleste in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, failing to score or assist.\n\nBrazilian winger Rodrygo has clinched third place in the rankings, courtesy of his sweet \u20ac110 million ($118.01 million) market valuation. The 23-year-old, who can operate on either wing as well as down the middle, will make his Copa America debut in the United States this June.\n\nThe two-time UEFA Champions League winner with Real Madrid has won 23 international caps with five-time FIFA World Cup winners Brazil. He has scored six times and provided an assist.\n\nThe engine of Uruguay and Real Madrid, Federico Valverde will be the most valuable midfielder featuring in Copa America 2024. According to Transfermarkt, the 25-year-old is currently valued at a cool \u20ac120 million ($128.74 million).\n\nAffectionately dubbed \"El Halcon\", Valverde has already played 56 matches for his country, scoring six times and providing two assists. He played nine matches across the last two iterations of the Copa America (2019, 2021), but failed to score or assist. It will be interesting to see how he fares this time around.\n\nCarrying an eye-popping \u20ac180 million ($193.11 million) valuation, Brazil superstar Vinicius Junior is by far the most valuable player taking part in the Copa America this summer. The Real Madrid talisman also happens to be the joint-most valuable player on the planet, with him sharing the podium with Real Madrid teammates Kylian Mbappe and Jude Bellingham, and Manchester City ace Erling Haaland.\n\nThe 23-year-old is seen as the flag-bearer of Brazilian soccer. However, his numbers have yet to catch up to his reputation. So far, he has played 30 international games for the Selecao, scoring just thrice and providing five assists. He played four matches in the 2021 Copa America and failed to chip in with a single goal or assist.", "source": {"uri": "sportslens.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportslens.com"}, "authors":

La Celeste went 4-1-1 in qualifying last fall, including a 2-0 victory over Brazil and a 2-2 draw against Colombia.\n\nEven better, Luis Suarez has been rejuvenated playing alongside Messi for Inter Miami with the duo tied for MLS lead with 12 goals apiece.\n\nUruguay's first Group C match is against Panama on Sunday followed by Bolivia and a showdown with the U.S. in Kansas City on July 1.\n\nThere's a clear delineation between the top three and the rest of the field but if the trio stumbles here are candidates to claim the Copa crown:\n\nThe Colombians are on a roll with a 23-match unbeaten streak, including 5-1 thrashing of the U.S. in a June 8 friendly.\n\nThey will rely on a strong defense and hope 32-year-old James Rodriguez can still engineer the attack.\n\nColombia's first match in Group D is Friday against Costa Rica.\n\nThis run-up to the 2026 World Cup in North America is critical.\n\nThe draw with Brazil gives the USMNT hope that coach Gregg Berhalter has the program on the upswing. Expectation are high for a team led by Christian Pulisic, beginning Sunday vs. Bolivia.\n\n\"I think anything besides making it out of the group will be bad for us, so we just want to be able to compete and get the best out of it,\" U.S forward Ricardo Pepi said.\n\nMuch like the U.S., Mexico wants to feed off its fans to offset what has been a so-so run-up up to the tournament.\n\nMexico has several European standouts including forward Santiago Gim\u00e9nez (Feyenoord) and midfielder Edson \u00c1lvarez (West Ham United).\n\nThe Mexicans in Group B play Jamaica, Venezuela and Ecuador.\n\nYes, experience matters but here are three players who may have a breakout tournament:\n\nHe's only 17 but has already shown the flair and skill exhibited by past Brazilian stars. He's joining Real Madrid this summer and Copa America could be a precursor to starring in the 2026 World Cup.\n\nHe will turn 20 on July 1 but has already made appearances in the 2022 World Cup and Copa Am\u00e9rica 2021. He spearheaded Manchester United's FA Cup win over Manchester United on May 25.\n\nFirst of all, the 24-year-old Liverpool striker shares a June 24th birthday with Messi.

Here's a group-by-group preview and predictions", "body": "Copa America kicks off Thursday night in Atlanta, with Inter Miami icon Lionel Messi and his defending champion Argentina team facing Canada at Mercedes Benz Stadium.\n\nLa Albiceleste (sky blue and white) are not only the reigning Copa champions, but also the World Cup champions, so they are the team to beat as the month-long tournament gets underway. Other teams expected to advance include Uruguay, Colombia, Brazil, Mexico and the host United States.\n\nHow it Works: The 16-team field is comprised of 10 teams from South America and six from North and Central America and the Caribbean. The tournament begins with four groups of four teams. During the group phase, teams earn three points for a win, one for a tie, and zero for a loss. After each team has played its group opponents once, the top two will advance.\n\nHere's a look at the groups, and predictions of which teams will move on to the knockout stage...\n\nGROUP A: Argentina, Peru, Chile, Canada\n\nDefending champion Argentina is the heavy favorite to raise the trophy again. Inter Miami star Messi, the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner, led La Albiceleste to the 2022 World Cup title and since their 2-1 loss to Saudi Arabia in the opening game of that World Cup, Argentina has won 17 of its past 18 matches. Their only loss was 2-0 to Uruguay in a World Cup qualifier.\n\nMessi is joined by a loaded roster that includes Julian Alvarez (Manchester City), Lautaro Martinez (Inter Milan), Rodrigo De Paul (Atletico de Madrid), Alexis Mac Allister (Liverpool), Enzo Fernandez (Chelsea), Cristian Romero and Lisandro Martinez.\n\nChile is expected to be the second-strongest team with veteran Alexis Sanchez among the players to watch. Chile beat Argentina twice in 2015 and 2016 in penalty kicks in the Copa America final.\n\nCanada has a shot to pull off an upset or two under new American coach Jesse Marsch. Peru lost 2-0 to both Argentina and Chile in World Cup qualifying and will have a tough time getting through the group, but if Edison Flores scores goals, La Rojiblanca could pull a surprise.\n\nOnce upon a time, Mexico would have been a lock to win this group, but things are more unpredictable these days.\n\nEl Tri has played in 10 Copa Americas, finished runner-up twice and third three times. But the team has struggled in recent years and lost two Copa warmup matches last week, 4-0 to Uruguay and 3-2 to Brazil, after a 1-0 win against Bolivia. The Mexican team is in a rebuild under coach Jaime Lozano, who left out some of the old guard and called up several Under-23 players. They could still advance, but maybe not win the group.\n\nEcuador has never won the Copa, and its best finish in the past four decades was fourth place in 1993, but this year's team is good enough to finish atop Group B. Coach F\u00e9lix Sanchez Bas has a talented roster, including Piero Hincapie of Bayer Leverkusen, Moises Caicedo of Chelsea and veteran leader Enner Valencia.\n\nVenezuela's La Vinotinto is a long shot to survive the group, but Yangel Herrera, who helped lead Girona to third place in Spain's La Liga, is a player to watch. Jefferson Savarino will be well-known to MLS fans from his years with Real Salt Lake.\n\nThe host USA is the headliner of the group and will have home-field advantage (although South American fans often outnumber the red, white and blue on U.S. soil). This U.S. team, led by captain Christian Pulisic, is arguably the most talented in the nation's history with nearly all its players based overseas. Pulisic and Yunus Musah play for AC Milan. Weston McKennie and Tim Weah play for Juventus. Matt Turner and Gio Reyna are teammates at Nottingham Forest. But the team had mixed results in Copa warmup matches, losing 5-1 to Colombia before rebounding with a 1-1 tie against Brazil.\n\nCo-favorite to advance is Uruguay, the 15-time South American champions, who are hungry to win for the first time since 2011. They have a good shot under the direction of Marcelo Bielsa and with Liverpool's Darwin Nunez leading the attack. Since last June, Uruguay has only lost two of 10 games under Bielsa and the team sits in second place in the CONMEBOL World Cup Qualifiers, three points behind Argentina. Inter Miami star Luis Suarez, 37, is on Uruguay's squad and eager to go far in what will likely be his last Copa.\n\nPanama and Bolivia would have to pull off shockers to survive this group. MLS duo Anibal Godoy and Adalberto 'Coco' Carrasquilla are two Panamanian players to watch. Panama has beaten the USA and made strides in recent years, but advancing will be tough. Bolivia's best player, Marcelo Martins Moreno, retired.\n\nBrazil is desperate to have a good showing after stumbling to sixth place in World Cup qualifying so far. Things are so bad that former star Ronaldinho slammed the team last week, posting on social media: \"That's it folks. l've had enough. This is a sad moment for those who love Brazilian soccer. It's getting hard to find the spirit to watch the games. This is perhaps one of the worst teams in recent years. It has no respectable leaders, only average players for the majority.\"\n\nThe pressure is on Brazil, which was eliminated from the 2022 World Cup by Croatia in the quarterfinals. The team has shown improvement in recent friendlies under new coach Dorival Junior, including wins over England and Mexico and a 1-1 tie against the USA last week.\n\nThe most in-form team in the group is Colombia, which is unbeaten in 23 games since 2022. Los Cafeteros, under coach Nestor Lorenzo, are unbeaten after their opening six group matches in the CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers with wins over Venezuela, Brazil and Paraguay, the latter two of which are in their Copa group.\n\nParaguay has won just two of its past 11 matches and Costa Rica has won four of its most recent 14 international matches.", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com",

"Preview: Argentina vs. Canada", "body": "Sports Mole previews Friday's Copa America clash between Argentina and Canada, including predictions, team news and possible lineups.\n\nArgentina will begin the defence of their Copa America title when they face Canada in Thursday's tournament opener at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.\n\nWith six CONCACAF teams participating in the tournament, Canada are set to make their Copa America debut after coming through a playoff against Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nMatch preview\n\nArgentina are the current holders of the Copa America crown after they edged out their old foes Brazil in the 2021 final to win the tournament for the first time since 1993, as Lionel Messi celebrated the first international trophy of his glittering career.\n\nLa Albiceleste subsequently followed their Copa America triumph with another successful performance at the 2022 World Cup, beating France on penalties in a thrilling final to clinch the coveted trophy for the first time since 1986.\n\nLionel Scaloni's side have been in fine form since their World Cup success, winning 13 and losing just one of their previous 14 matches, ensuring they will carry significant momentum into this summer's tournament in the USA.\n\nIn their two warm-up matches, Argentina edged out Ecuador via a 1-0 scoreline, before producing a free-scoring display to beat Guatemala and make it five consecutive victories since suffering a surprise defeat to Uruguay in October.\n\nHaving completed their preparations, La Albiceleste will now turn their full focus to the serious business of Group A, and the world champions will be heavy favourites to top the standings ahead of Canada, Chile and Peru.\n\nThursday's tournament opener represents Argentina's first meeting with Canada since a side managed by the legendary Diego Maradona cruised to a 5-0 friendly victory in May 2010.\n\nWhile Argentina are a 15-time winner of the Copa America, Canada are set to appear at the tournament for the very first time, securing qualification to participate as one of the six CONCACAF teams in the competition.\n\nCanada were forced to go through a playoff after they failed to qualify as one of the four best teams in the 2023-24 CONCACAF Nations League.\n\nThe Canucks ultimately showcased the extra quality in their squad to claim a 2-0 victory in March's playoff tie against Trinidad and Tobago following second-half efforts from Cyle Larin and Jacob Shaffelburg.\n\nAlthough Canada will want to give a good account of themselves, they may view the Copa America as a great opportunity to test themselves against some top-quality teams as they look to gain further major tournament experience ahead of the 2026 World Cup which they will co-host alongside USA and Mexico.\n\nCanada will also enter the competition under new management after they appointed Jesse Marsch last month, giving the American the chance to resume his coaching career following his departure from Leeds United in February 2023.\n\nMarsch began his tenure with a heavy 4-0 defeat to the Netherlands this month, but he would have been encouraged by the fact his side responded to that disappointing loss by holding France to a goalless draw.\n\nArgentina form (all competitions):\n\nLWWWWW\n\nCanada form (all competitions):\n\nLWLWLD\n\nTeam News\n\nScaloni revealed his final 26-man selection following the win over Guatemala, taking the tough decision to leave out Valentin Barco, Leonardo Balerdi and Angel Correa.\n\nThe Argentina boss is believed to be mulling over which two players from Enzo Fernandez, Alexis Mac Allister and Leandro Paredes should start in a midfield three alongside Atletico Madrid's Rodrigo De Paul.\n\nFresh from scoring twice against Guatemala, Messi will be looking to add to his 108 international goal tally when he lines up in Thursday's Copa America opener.\n\nThere is a possibility that Messi will be joined in the starting XI by another veteran forward Angel Di Maria, who will retire from international duty after the tournament.\n\nAs for Canada, Bayern Munich's Alphonso Davies is one of the standout names in the squad, and the left-back is set to operate in a back four alongside Alistair Johnston, Moise Bombito and Derek Cornelius.\n\nPorto's Stephen Eustaquio will wear the captain's armband, and the Canada skipper is expected to line up in the middle of the park alongside Watford's Ismael Kone.\n\nLille marksman Jonathan David will provide one of his country's main goal threats after netting 26 in 48 international appearances.\n\nArgentina possible starting lineup:\n\nMartinez; Molina, Romero, Otamendi, Acuna; Fernandez, Mac Allister, De Paul; Messi, Di Maria, Alvarez\n\nCanada possible starting lineup:\n\nCrepeau; Johnston, Bombito, Cornelius, Davies; Buchanan, Eustaquio, Kone, Millar; David, Larin\n\nWe say: Argentina 2-0 Canada\n\nWith Canada boasting talented players like Davies and David, they have enough quality in their squad to cause the defending champions a few problems, but we believe Argentina's array of world-class talent will ultimately shine through and result in a routine victory.\n\nFor data analysis of the most likely results, scorelines and more for this match please click here.\n\nbody check tags ::\n\nPreviews by email\n\nClick here to get Sports Mole's

Argentina are the favorites and the reigning champions having won the last edition and the 2022 World Cup while the likes of Brazil, Uruguay and Colombia hope to dethrone Lionel Messi and company. The United States, meanwhile, hope to impress and build momentum ahead of the 2026 World Cup, which they will host alongside Mexico and Canada.\n\nIt's going to be nearly a month of intense action with so much to prove from so many South American sides, especially those who aim to show that they haven't truly fallen such as Peru and Chile, aiming to regain lost form.\n\nBefore the action gets underway, let's take a look at our experts' picks for the tournament:\n\nMore Copa AmericaScheduleStandingsCopa America\n\nChuck Booth Pardeep Cattry Sandra Herrera\n\nWinnersUruguayArgentinaArgentina\n\nRunners-upArgentinaBrazilUruguay\n\nGolden BootDarwin Nunez, UruguayVinicius Jr., BrazilLautaro Martinez, Argentina\n\nSurprise teamVenezuelaUruguayEcuador\n\nDisappointing teamMexicoMexicoUSA\n\nHow far USMNT goQuarterfinalsQuarterfinalsQuarterfinals\n\nWhy Argentina will win the Copa America\n\nPicking a team with Messi to win a championship is expected, but Argentina are not a one-man team. They boast talent across the pitch in established stars like forward Lautaro Martinez and defender Cristian Romero, as well as exciting up-and-comers like Alejandro Garnacho and Valentin Carboni. Their recent success, coupled with optimism for the future and the fuel of sending off Messi on a high in what could be his final major international tournament should be more than plenty to see them lift the Copa America title for the 16th time. -- Pardeep Cattry\n\nWhy Argentina won't win the Copa America\n\nDespite winning the last Copa America, Argentina won't be able to defend their title which says more about how far soccer has come in South America since 2021. Running into an improved Uruguay side, Marcelo Bielsa and Luis Suarez will deny Messi the chance to go back-to-back but this tournament is getting much better at the top levels with Uruguay, Colombia and Ecuador all trending in the right direction. -- Chuck Booth\n\nWhy Vinicius Junior will win the golden boot\n\nThere are a lot of top-tier attackers that will vie for this title, but it's hard to bet against Vinicius Junior these days. He's undeniably one of the best players in the game right now after a stellar season with Real Madrid in which he scored 24 goals, including one in the UEFA Champions League final. Vinicius Junior is becoming a big game player for his club and with an opportunity do so for his country, it seems likely that he will meet the moment yet again. -- Pardeep Cattry\n\nWhy Mexico will disappoint\n\nOnce the gold standard of North America, Mexico lack the same quality they once had. Their malaise has translated into underwhelming results against a wide range of opponents, looking like the inferior side in losses to Brazil, Uruguay, the U.S. and even Honduras in recent months. El Tri may have the luck of the draw at the Copa America but there's little to suggest a young team will impress - and perhaps warning signs that they will not even hit minimum markers of success with the countdown to a World Cup on home soil underway. -- Pardeep Cattry\n\nWhy Venezuela will surprise\n\nAstonishingly Venezuela haven't played a match since March but it won't stop them from making an impression when they defeat Mexico to get out of their group. With one of the shortest players in the entire tournament in Yeferson Solteldo playing alongside one of the most physical in Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n, Venezuela may seem like a create-a-team but with a strong defense and a supply line for Rond\u00f3n, they're going to pull some upsets. -- Chuck Booth\n\nWhy USMNT will make the quarterfinals\n\nThey were already tested against CONMEBOL sides, embarrassed by Colombia (5-1 loss), and resilient against Brazil (1-1 draw). As the current kings of the region, with few issues dominating other Concacaf rivals, they're also tournament hosts. They're finally a squad with expectations, and destiny is truly in their own hands so it's time to live up to the privilege of pressure. -- Sandra Herrera", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com",

The national team hired Jesse Marsch just one month ago, and now, the new manager is tasked with getting his squad past a challenging group featuring Peru, Chile, and the reigning Copa America champions, Argentina. Although their odds are less than favorable, Canada's squad looks to produce a few massive upsets in the United States.\n\nHere's 90min's guide to Canada at Copa America 2024.\n\nJesse Marsch has only had since May to get to know his players before he had to select a final 26-man squad for Copa America 2024.\n\nOf course, Canada's most exciting players, including Bayern Munich's Alphonso Davies and Lille's Jonathan David, made the final cut, but there are a handful of stalwarts that were noticeably not selected by their new manager.\n\nMilan Borjan, Steven Vitoria, and Mark-Anthony Kaye all started for Canada at the 2022 World Cup, but none of them even made the Copa America 2024 roster. Additionally, Joel Waterman, the defender who helped Canada keep a clean sheet in their must-win match against Trinidad and Tobago, was originally left out of the final squad, but got called-up to replace the injured Junior Hoilett.\n\nCanada will open up the Copa America against the reigning champions, Argentina. Coming away with a point would be a huge result for Jesse Marsch's squad.\n\nThe next two fixtures for Canada get easier, but not by much. First, they must play Peru, a team that has not lost a game yet in 2024, followed by a match against Chile. La Roja always perform at the Copa America, and will like their chances of finishing second in Group A unless Canada can find all three points against them.\n\nIf Canada survive Group A and advance to the quarter-finals, they will surely finish second in the group; Argentina are an all-but sure bet to finish first. The runners-up of Group A must play the winners of Group B.\n\nMexico should win Group B, so Canada could be facing the reigning CONCACAF Gold Cup champions in their first ever Copa America knockout game.\n\nIt is no secret that Alphonso Davies is Canada's best player. The defender is one of the best fullbacks in the world, and at age 23, he has already won the Bundesliga five times and a Champions League with Bayern Munich. With rumors flying around about a possible Real Madrid move this summer, Davies will have all eyes on him every time Canada take the pitch.\n\nJonathan David must continue his goalscoring form if Canada want to make it out of Group A. In just 46 international caps for his country, the Lille man has scored 26 goals, including six in the CONCACAF Gold Cup back in 2019.\n\nTajon Buchanan needs to live up to his Best Young Player's award from the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup this summer. The 25-year-old struggled to find consistent minutes for Inter Milan this season, but he will be heavily relied on at Copa America 2024 to create more scoring opportunities like his assist for Davies' first ever World Cup goal.\n\nIt is hard to see Canada making it out of the Group Stage at Copa America 2024. Argentina will surely advance to the quarter-finals, and Chile seems like the best bet to come second in Group A.\n\nIf Canada want to make it to the next round, they will have to pull off some upsets, or at least come away with some hard-fought draws. Still, barring an Alphonso Davies takeover, the first-time Copa America participants will likely make an early exit.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"},

And this is where the train ends for Gregg Berhalter, but he's already playing with house money, as it were. Argentina beats the United States to win the Copa Am\u00e9rica to defend its Copa Am\u00e9rica title.\n\nPICK: Argentina to win Copa Am\u00e9rica (bet $10 to win $27.50 total)\n\nEveryone is going to pick defending World Cup champion Argentina and with good reason. But give me Brazil. After former Brazil great Ronaldinho took some jabs at the squad following a 1-1 draw with the USA recently, you have to assume the players will come in with extra motivation. No Neymar? No problem. There were a few puzzling roster decisions -- Richarlison, Casemiro, Gabriel Jesus -- but the team is young and led by exceptionally talented 17-year-old Endrick. This team has the most speed and raw talent in the field. Real Madrid teammates Rodrygo and Vini Jr. up front aren't even 25 years old and considered veterans.\n\nBrazil avenges the 2021 Copa title game loss to Argentina by hoisting the trophy.\n\nUruguay should win the group over the United States. That's a team that has plenty of attacking options, including Liverpool's Darwin Nunez and a great midfield featuring Federico Valverde and Nicolas De la Cruz. Brazil looks vulnerable and Uruguay could find itself in the final vs. Argentina.\n\nAt +500 I think this is a really strong bet.\n\nPICK: Uruguay to win Copa Am\u00e9rica (bet $10 to win $60 total)\n\nLionel Messi is favored, but Brazil's rising 23-year-old star is getting a ton of respect. He's second on the sheet at every sportsbook and the price ranges from +370 to +450. Vinicius will have ample scoring opportunities due to Neymar's knee injury, and I'm betting he finds the back of the net quite a bit.\n\nPICK: Vinicius Junior to win Golden Boot (bet $10 to win $55 total)", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Berhalter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gregg Berhalter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronaldinho", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ronaldinho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrygo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rodrygo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gabriel Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casemiro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casemiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neymar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neymar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richarlison", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richarlison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Valverde", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federico Valverde"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://a57.foxsports.com/statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2024/06/1408/814/CopaPredictionsH.png?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658543", "eventUri": "eng-9658543", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "dateEnd": "2024-07-14", "textStart": 241, "textEnd": 259}], "sentiment": 0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

He's clearly past his peak at Inter Miami after two decades of playing at the highest level in Europe.\n\nAlso Read | Copa America 2024 Schedule in IST, Free PDF Download Online: Get Fixtures, Time Table With Match Timings and Venue Details of CONMEBOL Football Tournament.\n\nMessi has not set a date for his retirement and has kept the door open to playing in a sixth World Cup in 2026 to defend his title from Qatar. But he already recognizes his shortcomings.\n\n\"I don't think about that yet. The moment I feel that I am not going to help my team, I will retire,\" Messi said in March in an interview with Saudi broadcaster Riyad Season. \"I always ate well, trained. But as I grew I became aware that the physical effort we make is getting harder. As you grow old, things become more difficult.\"\n\nAlso Read | England vs West Indies Free Live Streaming Online, ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024 Super 8: How To Watch ENG vs WI Cricket Match Live Telecast on TV?.\n\nLast year, the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner struggled with muscular injuries while playing in MLS and for Argentina. That didn't change much in 2024.\n\nMessi has shown he enjoys going out at night with his wife, Antonella, and his friends in Miami. He spends time with his three children, starts new businesses and lives as if soccer is slowly becoming a smaller part of his life.\n\nStill, he has 12 goals and 13 assists for Inter Miami this season.\n\n\"I have a good time at the club. I am lucky to have teammates and friends (Luis Su\u00e1rez, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba, all former Barcelona players) by my side,\" Messi told ESPN. \"I have a good time in the national team, where I have teammates and friends, too. And I enjoy the little details that I know that when I don't play anymore, I'm going to miss.\"\n\n\u00c1ngel di Maria, a 36-year-old winger who has played alongside Messi for years with the national team, is sure to bid farewell to international soccer after the Copa America. That has also brought more questions about whether the team's biggest star will remain on the squad.\n\n\"As long as I feel like I'm fine and I can continue contributing, I'm going to do it. Today, the only thing I think about is getting to the Copa America well and being able to compete in it,\" Messi told the Star Plus platform in December. \"Fighting for it again, as we always did, trying to be champions.\"\n\nArgentina's all-time top scorer and the national team's leader with 26 World Cup appearances is also seeking records in the continental competition.\n\nMessi, who won the South American championship in 2021, wants to become the Copa America's leading scorer. He has 13 goals in six editions, four behind Norberto M\u00e9ndez of Argentina and Zizinho of Brazil with 17.\n\nHe also wants to be the player with most appearances in the Copa America, a record he currently shares with former Chile goalkeeper Sergio Livingston, both with 34 games.\n\nMessi's teammates don't want to see him go.\n\n\"We'll see how long, but while he's here we're going to enjoy it to the fullest,\" Argentina defender Cristian Romero said. \"We grew up watching him.

Here's an inside look at organizers' decision-making.\n\nIn these final days before the Copa Am\u00e9rica kicks off, some real buzz for the tournament has finally arrived. The U.S. men earned a 1-1 tie vs. Brazil in their last tune-up game. Lionel Messi's Argentina kicks off the tournament against Canada in Atlanta on Thursday (8 p.m., FS1, Univision 62, TUDN, ViX). More than 1 million tickets have been sold across the 32 games.\n\nThere are many reasons South America's national team championship has come to the United States for the second time. The first, and easiest, is it will make South American soccer's governing body CONMEBOL a lot of money. That certainly happened with the first visit in 2016, and CONMEBOL's chief operating officer Thiago Jannuzzi told The Inquirer that this year's edition is on track to beat it.\n\n\"We do foresee an important increase in the revenue side compared to 2016,\" he said. In 2016, the tournament drew 1,483,855 fans to 32 games across 10 stadiums (including Lincoln Financial Field). That edition started unevenly at the box office but accelerated when the U.S. and Argentina started winning.\n\nJannuzzi and his colleagues also know that holding the Copa here is an ideal test run for the men's edition of the FIFA World Cup in 2026. It won't be a test in Philadelphia because there won't be games here, but there will be plenty of reasons to pay attention from home.\n\n\" READ MORE: Is the USMNT playing in the Copa Am\u00e9rica a big deal? Christian Pulisic sure thinks so.\n\nOn the field, the games will be the biggest ones that the World Cup's cohosts -- the United States, Canada, and Mexico -- get to play before the World Cup, because they won't have to qualify (although they did for the Copa). Opportunities to play the giants of South America are rare, especially in a real competition instead of a friendly.\n\n\"This is a very important moment in the U.S. market,\" Jannuzzi said. \"Bringing the tournament at this point is strategic on the commercial side ... but, technically speaking, it's really important as well for our teams so they can practice, they can compete against new cultures, new football teams that we're not used to during the tournaments we have in South America.\"\n\nThat was a nice thing to say, and it might even have a shred of truth. The top ends of the U.S. and Canadian player pools are so heavily based in Europe now that the national teams play (or at least try to play) a more European style of soccer, much different from what South American teams face.\n\nHow that will play out will be a notable storyline in this tournament. The U.S. will get its big group stage test in the finale against Uruguay, and Canada's will be against Argentina and Chile.\n\nBut it will be just as much of a measuring stick to see whether the North American neighbors can beat South American teams that on paper are favorable matchups. The U.S. plays its opener against Bolivia (which might be the worst team in a group that also includes Panama) on Sunday, and Canada plays its second group game against Peru on Tuesday.\n\nThere's more history of Concacaf teams playing in the Copa Am\u00e9rica than casual followers might know. Excluding the expanded 2016 edition, Mexico has done so nine times, Costa Rica four, the U.S. three (the last was 2007), and Jamaica once.\n\n\" READ MORE: The European Championship is also underway. Here are 10 reasons to watch it.\n\nOf course, there's no getting around the money part of all this, and Jannuzzi did not try to. He said this year's Copa Am\u00e9rica will make more than many past editions.\n\n\"Definitely comparing to the previous editions, it's a good improvement in terms of revenue,\" he said. \"We do not usually put out these kinds of numbers, but we are very satisfied [with] what we are facing here in the U.S.\"\n\nThough just eight of the tournament's 14 stadiums will host games in 2026, those eight will get some helpful practice at hosting the world's football. And all 16 teams, 10 from South America and six from North and Central America, will get some practice with the rigors of travel across the continent.\n\nUnfortunately, Philadelphia won't be a Copa host. In fact, the only stadium in the Northeast U.S. that will host any games is MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., which gets two group games (including Argentina's second vs. Chile) and a semifinal (that Argentina and Mexico could be in).\n\nThe Northeast isn't the only region down the pecking order. Kansas City is the only Midwestern venue, and Seattle was shut out, leaving the soccer-crazed Pacific Northwest empty-handed.\n\n\" READ MORE: Union goalkeeper Andre Blake is on Jamaica's Copa Am\u00e9rica roster, but it's not clear at all if he'll play\n\nJannuzzi confirmed that Lincoln Financial Field submitted a bid to be a venue, and said he \"wouldn't say they were good or bad ... but we had other assumptions to take into consideration when selecting the final stadiums for the tournament.\"\n\nOne of those factors became clear over the course of the conversation. It's not a coincidence that most of the venues are in the West and South, and no team will make a cross-country trip before the semifinals. That will help cut down travel times and the accompanying wear on players.\n\n\"If you take a look at the match calendar eight years ago, some of the teams were traveling six, seven hours between matches, which was a huge challenge for the teams, for the players especially,\" Jannuzzi said. \"This time, we tried the most to avoid this kind of situation. On average eight years ago, [in] 2016, the teams were traveling 3\u00bd hours, and for this edition, the average travel time is 2 hours, 15 minutes.\"\n\nWhen CONMEBOL signed a partnership deal with Concacaf in January 2023, it did not just relate to the Copa Am\u00e9rica. It also led to four South American teams playing in the long-awaited return of a Concacaf Gold Cup, this region's national team championship, for the women's side.\n\nThat tournament took place in February and March, and it was a smashing success. All four South American invitees -- Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Paraguay -- made the quarterfinals, and the United States beat Brazil in the final.\n\n\" READ MORE: Why this year's U.S. women's soccer team Olympic roster could be the hardest to make of all time\n\nThere also are plans for a \"final four\" style tournament of the top two men's club teams from each continent, creating a champion of the combined Americas. It's supposed to start this year, but the logistics aren't done yet.\n\nWhen the partnership was announced, there wasn't a set timeline for the national team tournaments. So will it continue for future quadrennial cycles?\n\n\"The future is really hard to predict, but as long as the relationship is fruitful and positive for both sides, I don't see any reasons to change,\" Jannuzzi said.\n\nOf course, it won't be up to him alone. Though Jannuzzi has a high-ranking title, CONMEBOL's top leader is president Alejandro Dom\u00ednguez, and Concacaf's is president Victor Montagliani.\n\nBut if they ask Jannuzzi his opinion, he might tell them what he told The Inquirer.\n\n\"Exchanging those opportunities is really important for both sides,\" he said. \"After every project, we evaluate and decide whether we should repeat, adapt, we might even increase tournaments. It always depends on the outputs. But as I said, so far it has been really, really positive.\"", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

that time translates across all of the time zones in Australia:\n\nLionel Scaloni's side have made a slight change in recent weeks as they've opted for a 4-4-2 formation with Lionel Messi partnering Lautaro Martinez up top.\n\nLisandro Martinez had his fair share of injuries for Manchester United in 2023/24 but returned for the FA Cup final and started both warm-up games.\n\nArgentina projected starting lineup (4-4-2): Martinez (GK) -- Molina, Romero, Martinez, Tagliafico -- De Paul, Fernandez, Mac Allister, Lo Celso -- Messi, Martinez.\n\nSince Jesse Marsch took charge of the Canada national team, they've used a 4-4-2 formation with Orlando City's Cyle Larin and Jonathan David leading the attack.\n\nInter Milan's Tajon Buchanan has been utilised out on the right with Derek Cornelius commanding from the back.\n\nCanada projected starting lineup (4-4-2): Crepeau (GK) -- Johnston, Bombito, Cornelius, Davis -- Buchanan, Kone, Eustaquio, Millar -- Larin, David.\n\nWith Canada making their debut in this tournament, Lionel Messi's World Cup winners Argentina should be too much for Jesse Marsch's side to handle.\n\nMessi bagged a brace against Guatemala and his record his national side has continuously proven his worth.\n\nCanada did, however, hold Kylian Mbappe's France to a 0-0 draw as the European side prepared for the Euro 2024 tournament.", "source": {"uri":

GIVEMESPORT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nAs Europe's biggest teams go to battle at Euro 2024, some of the biggest names from the other side of the world are gearing up for this summer's Copa America. The best of North, Central and South America are set to go toe to toe in the 47th edition of the continent's greatest tournament and, as always, some of the biggest stars are set to take centre stage between June 20th - July 14th.\n\nWith this region of the world being one of the biggest pools of talent in the modern game, it is no surprise to see just how many superstars will appear at the competition. These names, though, are the best twenty fans can expect to see.\n\nTop 20 Copa America 2024 Players\n\nRank\n\nPlayer\n\nCountry\n\n1\n\nVinicius Jr\n\nBrazil\n\n2\n\nLionel Messi\n\nArgentina\n\n3\n\nAlisson\n\nBrazil\n\n4\n\nFederico Valverde\n\nUruguay\n\n5\n\nLautaro Martinez\n\nArgentina\n\n6\n\nRodrygo\n\nBrazil\n\n7\n\nAlphonso Davies\n\nCanada\n\n8\n\nAlexis Mac Allister\n\nArgentina\n\n9\n\nEmiliano Martinez\n\nArgentina\n\n10\n\nJulian Alvarez\n\nArgentina\n\n11\n\nGabriel Magalhaes\n\nBrazil\n\n12\n\nBruno Guimaraes\n\nBrazil\n\n13\n\nLuis Diaz\n\nColombia\n\n14\n\nEndrick\n\nBrazil\n\n15\n\nDarwin Nunez\n\nUruguay\n\n16\n\nChristian Pulisic\n\nUnited States\n\n17\n\nRonald Araujo\n\nUruguay\n\n18\n\nLeon Bailey\n\nJamaica\n\n19\n\nEnzo Fernandez\n\nArgentina\n\n20\n\nAngel Di Maria\n\nArgentina\n\n20-11\n\nBoth Angel Di Maria and Enzo Fernandez were pivotal to Argentina's squad in the 2022 World Cup, with the former notching a goal in the final itself. Although they're at different stages of their international careers, both men are among the top players that Lionel Scaloni will have at his disposal this summer.\n\nLeon Bailey is the star man of the Reggae Boyz following a strong season at Aston Villa. Meanwhile, Ronald Araujo will play a leading role as part of Uruguay's backline. Christian Pulisic will also be looking to make it a tournament to remember, with this year's Copa America being held in his home country of the United States.\n\nDarwin Nunez may be hit or miss at Liverpool, but when the Uruguayan gets firing, he can be difficult to stop. Meanwhile, teenage sensation Endrick is the talk of the town. The 17-year-old is among the most exciting prospects in world football today and could lead the line for Brazil this summer.\n\nLuiz Diaz is expected to bring some flair to Colombia, whereas Bruno Guimaraes and Arsenal's Gabriel will look to offer a physical presence to Dorival Junior's squad. With the latter being one of the best centre-backs in the Premier League, it shows just how much talent will be playing at the tournament.\n\nRelated Copa America 2024: Dates, Venues, Groups, Tickets and More Keep up to date with all the key information surrounding Copa America 2024 as Lionel Messi's Argentina try to defend their title. 10 Julian Alvarez Argentina\n\nJulian Alvarez was never meant to be any more than a rotational option at the 2022 World Cup, being used in a similar way to how he was utilised at Manchester City at the time. Following a shock defeat to Saudi Arabia, that all changed and the forward has never looked back.\n\nAdding more balance to the Argentine line-up, Alvarez has made himself an integral part of the world champions' make-up. The 24-year-old has since been handed more regular starts at club level, which will only add to what he can bring to the national team this summer as they aim to defend their crown.\n\n9 Emiliano Martinez Argentina\n\nWhat would Argentina do without the enigmatic Emiliano Martinez in goal? For many, the man between the sticks has been a position of concern for the three-time world champions. But the arrival of Aston Villa's main man finally gave La Albiceleste a top-class shot-stopper.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Emiliano Martinez saved three penalties in the 2021 Copa America semi-final against Colombia.\n\nWith an immaculate record in penalty shootouts, the 31-year-old has not only proven that he is a man for the big occasions, but has become the type of figure who immediately strikes doubt into his opponents, which will always be an invaluable asset for any team.\n\nRelated Every Premier League Player at 2024 Copa America There are 41 Premier League players in total appearing at the 48th instalment of the Copa America this summer. 8 Alexis Mac Allister Argentina\n\nLiverpool's Alexis Mac Allister completes a trifecta of Argentine stars to kick off the top ten of this list. The midfielder has become one of the most impactful names in the game for both club and country. With Scottish ancestors, Steve Clarke can only imagine what if the former Brighton man had chosen to represent the Tartans instead.\n\nMac Allister opted for Argentina, and the success he has had since making his international debut makes it hard to argue with his decision. Alongside Enzo Fernandez, there could still be another decade of dominance for this duo and plenty more international honours coming the way of the 25-year-old.\n\n7 Alphonso Davies Canada\n\nThe only name in the top half of the list to represent a team outside of South America, Alphonso Davies is arguably the most terrifying individual to come up against in a one-on-one scenario. Whether it be using his lightning pace to snuff out attacks, or breezing past opposition defenders further up the pitch, Davies has speed to rival the quickest in the game.\n\nFor some, running at such speed can hamper their ability to keep close control of the ball. As the Bayern Munich man has proved time and time again, this is not an issue he has to worry about. There is every chance that the 23-year-old can lead the Canadians to a respectable tournament finish.\n\n6 Rodrygo Brazil\n\nRodrygo's talents often go under the radar, but make no mistake about it, the Brazilian is one of the finest talents not just at the Copa America, but in world football today. Often hidden in the shadows of Vinicius Jr and Jude Bellingham, the electric forward has provided many crucial moments in his young career, such as the comeback that inspired Real Madrid to overturn Manchester City's lead in their 2022 Champions League quarter-final.\n\nBrazil legend Ronaldinho had claimed that this current squad was the worst in history, before then stating that it was part of a publicity stunt. Regardless, to have labeled Rodrygo under that banner would have been royally unjustified, as the 23-year-old deserves his flowers.\n\nRelated Every Winner in Copa America History GIVEMESPORT provides a detailed breakdown of every winner in Copa America history. 5 Lautaro Martinez Argentina\n\nIt was Lautaro Martinez who found himself making way for Alvarez when a change in system was required at the 2022 World Cup. For many, that blow would be enough to crush their confidence, but the Inter Milan captain has used that as motivation and gone from strength to strength.\n\nMartinez steamrollered his challengers in the Serie A golden boot race, with his 24 strikes helping Milan regain the Scudetto. If the 26-year-old, who is about to enter the prime years of his career, can keep up this form, we could be looking at this year's Copa America top scorer.\n\n4 Federico Valverde Uruguay\n\nThe current Uruguay squad is lacking some big players from its past, such as Edinson Cavani. They do, however, retain the services of one undoubtedly world-class midfielder in Federico Valverde.\n\nThe Real Madrid maestro is often forced to play slightly out of position on the right flank for Carlo Ancelotti. This does not prevent him showcasing his quality, with his performances and triumphs in multiple competitions making it difficult to recognise that he is not a natural in that area of the pitch. Expect Valverde to be marshaling in the middle of the park this summer, exactly where he wants to be.\n\n3 Alisson Brazil\n\nThe story of Alisson's emergence as Brazil's number one follows a relatively similar story to Martinez's as Argentina's. For a period of time, the five-time world champions struggled to fill the shoes of legendary goalkeeper Dida. Since then, the Liverpool 'keeper has come into the fold and proven that he may even be better than the former Milan icon.\n\nAlready a winner of the competition back in 2019, another title will be high on the 31-year-old's list of priorities this summer. With Manchester City's Ederson out of the tournament due to injury, there will be pressure on Alisson to perform at his very best.\n\n2 Lionel Messi Argentina\n\nIn any other year, at any other point in his career, Lionel Messi would be the undisputed number one pick, no questions asked. Given that he is still the reigning Ballon d'Or holder and one of the best players in the world this year, an argument can be made that the little magician could still be top of the pile.\n\nAt the grand old age of 36 and playing his football out in the MLS, the former Barcelona man is no longer at the peak of his powers, even if he is still the best that his nation has to offer. Still capable of a moment of magic when the chips are down, Messi could still prove to be the difference maker as Argentina seek to make it back-to-back Copa Americas.\n\nRelated Every Winner of the Copa America Best Player Award There have been 15 winners of the Copa America Best Player award since 1987, with Lionel Messi, Neymar and Ronaldo among those to do so. 1 Vinicius Jr Brazil\n\nSome might say that Vinicius Jr is the best Brazilian player since Neymar. Others may contest it goes even further back. What can't be debated is the three league titles and two Champions Leagues the 23-year-old has already won in his career and how important he was to all of them.\n\nThe current favourite to win the Ballon d'Or in 2024 and become the first Brazilian to win the award since Kaka, should Vinicius take his club form into the tournament, there is every chance you can already write his name on the Player of the Tournament trophy and Brazil's name on the Copa America itself.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It's very difficult to imagine what can happen because it's still two years away. I don't need to commit right now to whether or not I'll be there,\" he added.\n\nWhat is certain is that Messi, who has managed his workload to try to be in peak condition for the tournament, would relish the chance to win a third straight major tournament with his country after so many years of frustration with his national team.\n\nAfter facing Canada, Argentina take on Chile in New Jersey before finishing their group A action against Peru in Miami but they know that tough opposition awaits in the knockout stage with rivals Brazil and Uruguay the two expected challengers for the title.\n\nBrazil have struggled in CONMEBOL qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup having won just two of their opening six games and they currently sit in sixth place in the standings having lost to Uruguay, Colombia and Argentina.\n\nThere are several familiar names missing from Dorival Junior's Brazil squad with Casemiro, Gabriel Jesus and Thiago Silva left out while Richarlison and Neymar are both missing due to injury.\n\nThe pressure will be on the Real Madrid attacking pair of Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo to translate their club form into success for the Selecao while there is much excitement around the senior tournament debut of 17-year-old talent Endrick, who is set to join Real next month from Palmeiras.\n\nUruguay, also 15-times winners, have impressed under their 68-year-old Argentina coach Marcelo Bielsa, who has brought his trademark high-energy style to the team and raised expectations with recent wins over Argentina and Brazil.\n\nLiverpool forward Darwin Nunez will lead the line although Bielsa has the option of introducing veteran Luis Suarez from the bench.", "source": {"uri": "khaleejtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Khaleej times"},

translates across some of the major territories around the globe:\n\nLionel Scaloni's side have made a slight change in recent weeks as they've opted for a 4-4-2 formation with Lionel Messi partnering Lautaro Martinez up top.\n\nLisandro Martinez had his fair share of injuries for Manchester United in 2023/24 but returned for the FA Cup final and started both warm-up games.\n\nArgentina projected starting lineup (4-4-2): Martinez (GK) -- Molina, Romero, Martinez, Tagliafico -- De Paul, Fernandez, Mac Allister, Lo Celso -- Messi, Martinez.\n\nSince Jesse Marsch took charge of the Canada national team, they've used a 4-4-2 formation with Orlando City's Cyle Larin and Jonathan David leading the attack.\n\nInter Milan's Tajon Buchanan has been utilised out on the right with Derek Cornelius commanding from the back.\n\nCanada projected starting lineup (4-4-2): Crepeau (GK) -- Johnston, Bombito, Cornelius, Davis -- Buchanan, Kone, Eustaquio, Millar -- Larin, David.\n\nWith Canada making their debut in this tournament, Lionel Messi's World Cup winners Argentina should be too much for Jesse Marsch's side to handle.\n\nMessi bagged a brace against Guatemala and his record his national side has continuously proven his worth.\n\nCanada did, however, hold Kylian Mbappe's France to a 0-0 draw as the European side prepared for the Euro 2024 tournament.", "source": {"uri":

It sets up a bonanza of international games this summer, as many of the world's great soccer powers are in action at the same time.\n\nThe Copa Am\u00e9rica is traditionally reserved for the 10 nations of South America (the CONMEBOL federation of FIFA), with the occasional guest or two invited to compete. Outside of the World Cup, it is the most prestigious trophy a South American nation can win. The most recent edition in 2021 featured just the South American teams, while the 2019 tournament included Qatar and Japan as special guests.\n\nSix CONCACAF nations (of North and Central America, and the Caribbean) were invited to form a full 16-team tournament this summer as a prelude to the upcoming 2026 World Cup in the United States, Mexico, and Canada.\n\nArgentina and Brazil have won the last two Copas in 2021 and 2019, respectively. They are the favorites to win it again, but improvements from Colombia and Uruguay, plus the addition of Mexico and the U.S., should challenge the two international Goliaths.\n\nTo preview Copa Am\u00e9rica 2024, I ranked all 16 teams in the tournament, nominated a key player to watch for each, and shared some bets I've made.\n\nNote: All CONMEBOL qualifying expected goals (xG) data is from FootyStats.\n\nArgentina has the distinct advantage of not playing a single team ranked in the top five of these rankings during the group stage. Because of how the draw broke, and the fact that Lionel Messi still plays for the team, La Albiceleste are the favorites to win the tournament. Argentina is on top of the soccer world after beating Brazil in the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica final and following it up with a triumph at the World Cup a year later.\n\nEven though the World Cup final ended on penalty kicks, Argentina's out-of-possession work rate and defensive solidity enabled them to dominate France for the first hour of that match. The center back partnership of Cristian Romero and Lisandro Mart\u00ednez is an excellent combination of aggression and passing range. Manager Lionel Scaloni has multiple options in midfield depending on the opponent. The deep-lying passing range of Leandro Paredes and Rodrigo De Paul, plus the work rate of Giovani Lo Celso, recently starred in a 1-0 tune-up win against Ecuador. Scaloni also has the younger, more all-around skilled Premier League midfielders Alexis Mac Allister and Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez to turn to if needed.\n\nAlthough Messi has been playing outside the elite European leagues for a year now, he is still one of the most creative players on the planet. Strikers Lautaro Mart\u00ednez and Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez had effective Inter Milan and Manchester City club seasons, respectively (the former winning Serie A's golden boot), and Messi should be able to feed them. There are questions about the depth of this squad beyond the first 15 or so players, but Argentina isn't likely to be tested too much in its group.\n\nDuring the first six matches of CONMEBOL 2026 World Cup qualifying, Argentina had the best expected goal difference. When you add La Albiceleste's ace in the hole -- goalkeeper Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, who has an excellent penalty shootout record -- Argentina has key advantages against the field. Mart\u00ednez has won five consecutive penalty shootouts, with 10 penalties saved in 24 attempts, including two in the 2022 World Cup.\n\nFor what it's worth: There is no extra time in the Copa Am\u00e9rica knockout rounds. It's straight to penalties if teams are tied after 90 minutes.\n\nPlayer to watch: Cristian Romero (Tottenham Hotspur)\n\nNeymar was Brazil's best player in their Copa Am\u00e9rica final loss to Argentina in 2021. For all of the depth and talent that the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o have, Neymar's absence is a critical missing link as he continues to recover from an ACL injury. Still, Brazil has Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, Gabriel Martinelli, Raphinha, and wunderkind Endrick, so they're not exactly hurting for quality options going forward.\n\nVinicius is the second favorite to win the tournament's Golden Boot, according to betting markets. He was arguably the best player in the world this season at Real Madrid, and he has attacking chemistry with club teammate Rodrygo. There's no doubting the strength of this team, but the performances in recent World Cup qualifying matches do not suggest total dominance over the rest of CONMEBOL.\n\nBrazil started that stretch of games well, running up the score on Bolivia with a 5-1 victory in the opening matchweek. Here are Brazil's results since then: a 1-0 win against Peru (stoppage time goal), 1-1 draw with Venezuela, 2-0 defeat at Uruguay, 2-1 loss at Colombia, 1-0 loss against Argentina. Brazil is sixth in the table with a plus-1 goal difference.\n\nLast week, the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o played their full-strength lineup in a friendly against a wounded United States and settled for a 1-1 draw. Brazil created more chances and forced Matt Turner into 11 saves, but it was notable how much the U.S. created in its attack as well. If not for the excellent goalkeeping of Alisson, the U.S. would have scored multiple times, too.\n\nBrazil's center back pairing of Lucas Beraldo and Marquinhos offers an excellent combination of aerial prowess and on-ball quality, but there are questions about the dominance of the Brazilian midfield. Lucas Paquet\u00e1 is creative on the ball, and Bruno Guimar\u00e3es loves to get forward, but the Brazil defense might be left vulnerable as a result.\n\nTalent alone keeps Brazil in the second spot, but there are cracks in this team and real concerns they could go home earlier than expected.\n\nPlayer to watch: Vinicius Junior (Real Madrid)\n\nArgentina and Brazil have been the two best teams in South America for most of recent history, but the gap between them and the rest is as small as it's ever been thanks to Colombia and Uruguay's improvements in this current cycle. Colombia lost a penalty shootout in the 2021 Copa semifinal to Argentina and failed to qualify for the 2022 World Cup after finishing one point behind Peru. Colombia has since not lost a match, dating back to February 1, 2022. That's a 23-match unbeaten run.\n\nSince that loss to Argentina, Colombia has beaten Mexico twice, shut out Spain and Germany in friendlies, and taken down Brazil in 2026 World Cup qualifying. The 5-1 demolition of the U.S. last week underlines how well Colombia are playing right now.\n\nColombia has a lot of continuity within its lineup. Luis Diaz is the superstar left winger through whom most of the attack is played, and James Rodriguez remains a very capable central creator even though he's past his peak at 32. Luis Sinisterra, Jhon Dur\u00e1n, and Jhon Arias offer a ton of wide forward talent to surround Diaz.\n\nThe midfield pairing of Mateus Uribe and Jefferson Lerma isn't flashy, but both have high work rates and make Colombia difficult to play through. Colombia is poised to give Brazil a real challenge when they meet in their final group match.\n\nThis current version of Uruguay is almost unrecognizable from the team that played in Qatar in December 2022. The slow tempo and often dull soccer of their World Cup, combined with some bad finishing (insert your Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez jokes here), led to a group-stage exit behind Portugal and South Korea. Now, with Argentine manager Marcelo Bielsa at the helm, Uruguay has turned up the tempo and is ready to challenge for a Copa Am\u00e9rica title.\n\nBielsa is known for his manic pressing structure and man-to-man marking. It's a much better fit for the current personnel, because of the dynamic and athletic nature of its midfield and attacking talent. Uruguay did make the round of 16 of the 2018 World Cup, but the nation has experienced a real down period otherwise. The Uruguayans -- who have won two World Cups, but none since 1950 -- failed to advance out of the group in the 2016 Copa Am\u00e9rica, then lost in the quarterfinals in 2019 and 2021. Now, as the third betting favorite in the whole tournament and favorite to win Group C, Bielsa's squad has a good combination of system and talent to produce results.\n\nUruguay has played one of the toughest, if not the toughest, stretches of six matches in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying thus far. The nation sits in second in the qualifying standings, an impressive six points ahead of Brazil. La Celeste lost at Ecuador early in that run, but has since tied Colombia on the road and followed it up with consecutive 2-0 victories against Argentina and Brazil. Argentina has two losses in all of the 2020s: Saudi Arabia, in that shock 2022 World Cup opener, and the home defeat to Uruguay in November.\n\nThe strength of Uruguay is in the energetic midfield. The combination of Fede Valverde (Real Madrid) and Rodrigo Bentancur (Tottenham Hotspur) along with Manuel Ugarte (PSG) and Nicolas de la Cruz (Flamengo) gives Bielsa a ton of pressing options. Uruguay is also tough to play against because of star forward Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez. As much as he may get meme'd for his finishing skills, N\u00fa\u00f1ez grabbed a hat trick in a 4-0 demolition of Mexico in a pre-tournament friendly. He's the third favorite behind Messi and Vinicius Junior to win the Golden Boot.\n\nPlayer to watch: Fede Valverde (Real Madrid)\n\nEcuador was unfortunate to get bounced from its 2022 World Cup group without advancing to the knockout stage. La Tri beat hosts Qatar and earned an impressive draw against the Netherlands, but lost 2-1 to Senegal after conceding from a set piece and a penalty. Regardless, Ecuador showed in that World Cup that it was solid defensively. The question then, as it remains now, was whether there was enough goal-scoring output in this team.\n\nEcuador enter this Copa Am\u00e9rica in the most wide-open of the four groups. Without any of this list's top four teams in their group, Ecuador could be the best among Mexico, Jamaica, and Venezuela. In three high-profile World Cup qualifiers thus far, Ecuador lost 1-0 at Argentina on a Messi goal, tied Colombia 0-0, and beat Uruguay 2-1 in Quito.\n\nThe underlying statistics have shown Ecuador to be about average (minus-0.05 xG difference per match) in qualifying overall. Ecuador lacks offensive explosiveness but is resilient against teams with more talent because of the defensive solidity.\n\nThe strength of the Ecuador system is in the back four and defensive midfield. Left back Piero Hincapi\u00e9 and central midfielder Mois\u00e9s Caicedo have impressed at top clubs in Europe, while the center back pairing of F\u00e9lix Torres and William Pacho has been a reliable pair as of late. The question is whether 34-year-old striker Enner Valencia can find some form at his advanced age. They opted to start Ipswich Town winger Jeremy Sarmiento up front against Argentina in a friendly and were largely toothless going forward.\n\nIn six World Cup qualifying matches, Ecuador has scored five goals and conceded three. Given the relative strength of South American teams in recent friendlies against top CONCACAF squads, South America, rounded out by Ecuador, claims the top five spots in this ranking. That also puts Ecuador as the presumed winner of their Copa group, and +175 is a juicy price to back them to do just that. If things go their way, they could avoid Argentina until a potential semifinal matchup.\n\nMost power rankings would have the United States higher, but it will be very difficult for the Americans to make a deep run in this tournament. Even when the U.S. is playing on home soil, we've seen opposing fans take over the stadium in pre-tournament friendlies against Colombia and Brazil. There was probably too much overreaction to the 5-1 Colombia defeat, where I thought the U.S. played pretty well for 65 minutes until individual errors in possession derailed the team. But on the whole, there are still doubts about this U.S. squad, especially on defense after Matt Turner was forced into 11 saves against Brazil.\n\nThe initial schedule favors the USMNT, because they'll play highly winnable games against Bolivia and Panama. Anything short of six points from those two matches would be a major disappointment for Gregg Berhalter's side. The biggest question for the USMNT entering this tournament is how they'll replace the injured Sergi\u00f1o Dest at right back. Dest is a talented attacker and provides key width for the team, and they don't have a proper replacement for all of his skills. Joe Scally seems to have won the job, and he performed admirably well against Ballon d'Or favorite Vinicius Junior in the Brazil friendly.\n\nThere will always be plenty of hand-wringing about the United States from within, but this is definitely a talented group. All 11 starters against Colombia play in Europe's top five leagues. Christian Pulisic enters this tournament in excellent form following a great club campaign with AC Milan. Tyler Adams isn't fully fit because he's barely played this year; that would be a major problem for the U.S. in past years, but the emergence of Johnny Cardoso as a deep lying midfielder and ball-winner has helped the Americans solve that issue.\n\nThis is the first major international tournament for sought-after striker Folarin Balogun, who opted to declare for the USMNT rather than England or Nigeria. He had an excellent assist against Colombia and will need to be effective in transition. The United States will be underdogs to Uruguay in the final group match, and then it will almost certainly face Colombia or Brazil in the quarterfinals. Even an upset win in the quarters would set them up to once again play Uruguay, or Brazil, or Colombia in the semifinals. The path is arduous, but the more games the Americans play against top CONMEBOL sides, the better.\n\nMexico is never really in serious danger of missing a World Cup because of how weak CONCACAF is (plus the newly expanded 48-team field), but the United States has dominated the North American rivalry under Gregg Berhalter. When you combine that dominance with Mexico's poor showing in Qatar, this is certainly one of the low points for El Tri. Mexico is the favorite to win its group in the betting markets, but there's major uncertainty beyond that.\n\nEl Tri played three friendlies to prepare for Copa Am\u00e9rica. They beat Bolivia 1-0 but were far from dominant in that match. Uruguay smoked them 4-0 in Denver, and Brazil's B team beat them 3-2 in Texas. The U.S. beat them 3-0 in the 2023 Nations League semifinal and followed it up with a 2-0 win in March in the 2024 final.\n\nSome familiar names who have donned the Mexican national team shirt for a decade now will not play for El Tri in this tournament. Mexico is trying to embrace its next generation of talent by leaving goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa, striker Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez, and winger Hirving Lozano off the roster.\n\nThe spine of the 26-man roster is largely similar to the 2022 World Cup, anchored in the midfield by West Ham's Edson Alvarez and in defense by Jorge S\u00e1nchez and C\u00e9sar Montes, who play club soccer for Porto and Almeria, respectively. The key is whether Santiago Gim\u00e9nez can carry over his excellent club form to the national team. He scored 23 goals in 30 matches this season for Feyenoord in the Dutch Eredivisie, but he has only four goals in 27 caps for Mexico. He's one of the better forwards in this tournament, and he'll need to be at his best if Mexico has any chance of going deep.\n\nMexico is highly likely to advance to the knockout round given their weak group, but their struggles in and out of CONCACAF push them further down these rankings.\n\nPlayer to watch: Santiago Gim\u00e9nez (Feyenoord)\n\nScoring goals has been a major issue for Chile through its first six World Cup qualifying matches. Chile has averaged 1.24 xG per match but has scored just three goals thus far (0.5 per match). It's still the no. 2 pick in Copa America's Group A, behind Argentina, even though this version of Chile is nowhere near the peak golden generation of 2015 and 2016.\n\nChile won its first Copa Am\u00e9rica title on home soil in 2015, beating Argentina in a penalty shoot-out. La Roja followed that up with a repeat title in the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario in 2016, again taking down Argentina in a shoot-out. Alexis S\u00e1nchez is still one of the star men for Chile, even though he's 35 and playing limited minutes at Inter Milan this season. Claudio Bravo, 41, is still in goal, and 34-year-old forward Eduardo Vargas remains one of the other key contributing goal scorers. In Dar\u00edo Osorio, however, they do have an exciting young winger who can inject some pace into the team.\n\nThe Chileans played a highly competitive friendly with France that ended in a 3-2 loss and comfortably beat Albania and Paraguay in their other matches. La Roja may be far from one of the tournament favorites, but a second-place finish in Group A would very much leave them alive to make a semifinal run. None of the teams in Group B that they'd face in a quarterfinal are in top form right now.\n\nPlayer to watch: Dar\u00edo Osorio (Midtjylland)\n\nNo stat better summarizes the current iteration of Paraguay than this one: Throughout its first six World Cup qualifying matches, four goals have been scored in total. Paraguay scored only one of those and conceded the other three. Its performances in recent friendlies haven't been convincing, either. The team lost 3-0 to Chile and tied Peru 0-0. Paraguay finally nabbed a goal in its 1-0 friendly victory against Panama on Sunday, its final warm-up match before the tournament.\n\nThe overall lack of goal scoring is a bit surprising, given some of Paraguay's attacking options. Miguel Almir\u00f3n has found success in the Premier League at Newcastle, while Julio Enciso has impressed in limited minutes at Brighton. Torino's Antonio Sanabria scored Paraguay's only goal in qualifying, but he's not on the Copa Am\u00e9rica roster.\n\nParaguay would have a good chance of getting out of any other group in this competition, but trying to escape from Group D will be difficult. La Albirroja will open the tournament against Colombia, then face Brazil and Costa Rica. Paraguay will be a solid favorite in that final match, but it'll need to surprise one of the top contenders to have a chance of reaching the knockouts.\n\nPlayer to watch: Julio Enciso (Brighton)\n\nVenezuela has started World Cup qualifying with impressive results -- nine points from six matches have it fourth in the 10-team table. A look at the baseline expected goals metrics would suggest that it's benefited from good fortune defensively, but we shouldn't completely change what we think of Venezuela based on those six matches. xG isn't the be-all, end-all soccer statistic, but it can be helpful to explain such a low-scoring sport. Venezuela has allowed 1.29 xG per match, or 7.74 total, the third worst in the confederation during qualifying. Yet it's conceded only three actual goals.\n\nThe attack still runs through former Premier League striker Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n, a target man at the top of the pitch. At 34, he doesn't offer much out of possession, where Venezuela aims to deny access to the center of the pitch and force teams to rely on crossing. Given Venezuela's solid aerial ability, the defense is at its best when teams are forced to swing balls in from wide into the penalty area.\n\nAll three of Venezuela's expected starting center backs -- Jhon Chancellor, Wilker Angel, and Yordan Osorio -- have at least 29 caps for the national team and valuable experience playing together. The team has also had some young talent come through the pipeline, namely wing back Jon Aramburu. Based on their form, Venezuela is likely to be a trendy dark horse pick in an open Group B, but it still has a clear talent deficit against Ecuador and Mexico.\n\nPlayer to watch: Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n (Pachuca)\n\nMany American soccer fans thought that Jesse Marsch was destined to coach the USMNT one day. As of May, the Wisconsin native and former Bundesliga and Premier League manager is managing the Canadian national team. He's signed on to do so through the 2026 World Cup, which Canada is joint host of.\n\nFormer manager John Herdman brought Canada to soaring heights in 2022, when the men's team qualified for the World Cup for the second time (the last time was in 1986). He left the national team for an MLS job in 2023, and it has struggled mightily since its group stage exit in Qatar.\n\nMarsch has been tested immediately in the new job, as the Canadians played away friendlies against the Netherlands and France to prepare for this tournament. Canada lost 4-0 against the Dutch because of a disastrous second half but then held France to a very respectable scoreless draw.\n\nMarsch's tactics are notorious for pressing intensity and quick, direct passing once the ball is won in midfield or the final third. This seems to suit the skill set of goal scorer Jonathan David, who is excellent at running in behind defenses. This season David also excelled under the more possession-based Paulo Fonseca at Lille, scoring 19 goals in Ligue 1. Alphonso Davies of Bayern Munich is the star midfielder and wing back for the national team and was recently named captain at just 23.\n\nIt's unclear whether Marsch has had enough time on the training ground with this crew to implement his ideas and plans, making Canada an interesting unknown headed into this tournament. It'll open against Argentina in the tournament's first match on June 20.\n\nPlayer to watch: Jonathan David (Lille)\n\nIn the past two years, Peru's stock has dropped more than that of any other nation in this competition. It lost a penalty shoot-out to Australia for the 32nd and final 2022 World Cup spot and has not won a competitive match since. Peru would have fancied its chances of qualifying for the expanded World Cup in 2026, but so far it's scored only one goal in six qualifying matches. We're now one-third of the way through the qualifying process, and Peru is dead last of the 10 CONMEBOL teams, with zero wins, two draws, and four defeats.\n\nLosses to Argentina, Brazil, and an in-form Chile aren't terrible, but Peru's 2-0 defeat to Bolivia has raised alarm bells and led to changes. Juan Reynoso is out as manager, and the Uruguayan Jorge Fossati has been named as his successor. He'll coach his first competitive match at Copa Am\u00e9rica. He has his work cut out for him: The Peruvians have created the fewest expected goals in attack during World Cup qualifying and allowed the second most defensively, so this isn't a matter of variance. It's played like the joint-worst team (sharing that honor with Bolivia) in CONMEBOL over the past 18 months.\n\nFossati has set up Peru in a back three/back five system defensively. The team relies almost exclusively on the wing backs to provide width, with the front two strikers often alternating between coming short and running in behind opposition defenses on the break. Most of the attack, along with the chance creation of 22-year-old playmaker Piero Quispe in the middle, will come through the wide areas.\n\nThe battle for second place behind Argentina in Group A will surely be highly competitive, but it's tough to see Peru advance over Chile or even Canada without a significant turnaround in form.\n\nTwo of Jamaica's key players enter this tournament with major doubts about whether they can even play. Both wide forward Leon Bailey and goalkeeper Andre Blake are included in the squad, but Bailey insists he's not playing in the tournament and wants to take a break from the national team. Blake, meanwhile, recently underwent meniscus surgery, and the Philadelphia Union, his club team, released a statement on May 28 saying he was expected to miss four to six weeks.\n\nJamaica still has Michail Antonio, Ethan Pinnock, and Bobby Decordova-Reid, active Premier League talents; former Premier League forward Demarai Gray is also included in the squad. Jamaica has improved defensively in the past few years under Icelandic manager Heimir Hallgrimsson, which showed when the Reggae Boyz nearly blanked the United States in the March Nations League semifinal. The Americans scored a deflected stoppage time goal to level the match and won in extra time, but the improved organization under Hallgrimsson gives Jamaica a chance to outperform its talent levels.\n\nJamaica isn't considered a top-four CONCACAF team, but the Reggae Boyz finished third in the Nations League by beating Canada in the quarterfinal and Panama in the third-place match.\n\nTactically, Jamaica uses a back three that morphs into a back five out of possession. Jamaica relies on Antonio's skilled holdup play to get in behind. With Antonio up top and Bailey and Gray playing off him, Jamaica impressed at the Gold Cup last summer. Without Bailey and likely without Blake in goal, though, the Reggae Boyz seem destined to finish fourth in this group.\n\nPlayer to watch: Michail Antonio (West Ham)\n\nFew teams in the world stand to benefit more from the expanded World Cup field than Panama. It made the World Cup for the first time in 2018 -- essentially in place of the United States, which shockingly failed to qualify -- but lost all three matches with a minus-9 goal difference. CONCACAF expanded from 3.5 to six full bids, which means Panama will likely qualify for the World Cup in 2026. This tournament is a chance for the team to prove it belongs.\n\nPanama made a run to the Gold Cup final in 2023, beating the United States B team in a penalty shootout in the semifinal before losing 1-0 to Mexico in the final. Panama also thrashed Costa Rica 6-1 on aggregate over two legs to book its spot in the Nations League semifinal this March.\n\nThe team is still a tier below the top squads in CONCACAF and at least two tiers below the major CONMEBOL powers, but the United States and Uruguay cannot overlook Panama as a tricky match in this group.\n\nPlayer to watch: An\u00edbal Godoy (Nashville)\n\nBolivia has sat at the bottom of South American soccer for multiple cycles. It failed to get a single point in 10 matches across the last three Copa Am\u00e9ricas in 2016, 2019, and 2021. Bolivia also finished ninth in the 10-team CONMEBOL qualifiers for the 2022 World Cup.\n\nBolivia did beat Peru 2-0 in its home stadium in La Paz (with an elevation of 12,000 feet) during this qualifying cycle, but it's had almost no success playing away from home. Through the first six matches of qualifying for the 2026 World Cup, Bolivia has the worst xG difference, at minus-0.92 per match. It did keep 59 percent of the ball and managed 10 shots in a recent 1-0 friendly defeat to Mexico on May 31. But none of the players on its Copa Am\u00e9rica roster have more than seven goals scored in their international careers.\n\nBolivia will open with the United States and then play Group C favorite Uruguay, which likely means its final group match against Panama will be for nothing but pride. Third place isn't out of the question, but Bolivia is the fourth-best team in this group.\n\nIt's easy to forget that Costa Rica is the last CONCACAF team to win a knockout match at the World Cup. Los Ticos beat Greece in the round of 16 in 2014 and nearly made the semifinal, but they lost to the Netherlands in a penalty shootout. Costa Rica consistently competed at or near the top of the confederation throughout most of the 2010s, but with this version of the team, that is no longer the case.\n\nPlaced into the most challenging group -- with Brazil, Colombia, and Paraguay -- Costa Rica will need multiple surprise upsets to advance to the knockouts.\n\nCosta Rica will always have those two minutes at the 2022 World Cup in which it led Germany during the last game of group matches and was about to make it out of their group in Qatar, but no team at that World Cup conceded more expected goals (10.1 in just three matches) than Costa Rica. It's up for debate whether Los Ticos are indeed the worst team in this field, but escaping their Copa group is near impossible.\n\nThere are some names to know for Los Ticos, as PSG goalkeeper Keylor Navas is expected in goal, legendary goal scorer Joel Campbell remains in the squad, and striker Manfred Ugalde has found success playing for Spartak Moscow in Russia.\n\nGiven the recent struggles of CONCACAF teams when facing nations outside the confederation, Costa Rica claims the last spot in the power rankings.", "source": {"uri": "theringer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Ringer"},

He's also the author of \"Net Gains: Inside the Beautiful Game's Analytics Revolution.\"\n\nThe last time the United States hosted a Copa America in 2016, Brazil got knocked out in the group stages. The U.S. men's national team lost 4-0 to Argentina in the semifinals. And Argentina lost the final in penalties to Chile at MetLife Stadium, home of the New York Giants and Jets. It was Argentina's second loss to Chile in a Copa America final in as many years, and it led to Lionel Messi -- presumably distraught at being unable to live up to the legacies created by Eli Manning and Ryan Fitzpatrick on that same field -- retiring from international soccer immediately following the match.\n\nWhile Messi has spent his career expanding our collective imagination of what's possible on a soccer field and in a soccer career, I don't think anyone could've accurately predicted where we'd be eight years later. Messi is in Year 2 of playing for Inter Miami, a soccer team that didn't exist in 2016. He spent two barely memorable seasons playing for Paris Saint-Germain. Oh, and he unretired so he and Argentina could finally win the Copa America and World Cup in consecutive years in his mid-30s.\n\nElsewhere, Chile have since failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup and the 2022 World Cup. The other semifinalists in 2016 missed one a piece: the U.S. failed to qualify for 2018, Colombia for 2022. Brazil didn't make it past the quarterfinals of either tournament, and just two players from their 2016 Copa team are still around in 2024 (Alisson and Marquinhos).\n\nMexico, meanwhile, continue to lose to the USMNT in the Nations League, a tournament that didn't exist eight years ago. And Canada are managed by Jesse Marsch -- a statement that would've been meaningless in 2016 but not so today because he's managed multiple clubs in the Champions League and the Premier League since the Copa America Centenario.\n\nThe Copa America is the kind of tournament that can change the course of soccer as we know it, and it really matters to the teams that participate. So, given all the twists and turns we've had since the last time a Copa America was played on U.S. soil, why not look at the state of the 2024 tournament and make some predictions for where this all might end up?\n\nIt's time to look into our stats-filled, analytics-powered crystal ball and predict how every single game of the 2024 Copa America plays out and who, ultimately, will be crowned the winner. Let's go!\n\nTo rate all of these teams, I created a simple model that combines team performance with the talent level of the current squad. For the former, we're using the World Football Elo ratings, which are a continuously updated set of ratings that either awards or subtracts points based on every game played -- adjusted for scoreline, opponent quality and competitiveness of the match.\n\nGiven that they've won the last continental and global competitions, Argentina are, unsurprisingly, the highest-rated team in the world, with a rating of 2,143. For context: Eastern Samoa are the lowest-rated team in the world, ranking 241st with a rating of 377.\n\nElo accounts for 60% of the model, and then the other 40% comes from the overall squad value of each team, as estimated by Transfermarkt. We've normalized the transfer values to match the Elo scale, and then averaged the two values. And then we turned those numbers into a 0-100 scale -- with 100 being the best team and zero being the worst. Here's how everyone stacks up:\n\nArgentina are in the top tier with Brazil and then... there's no one from Group A in either of the next two tiers.\n\nThrough six matches of World Cup qualifying, Peru have two points and Chile five. The former ranks second-to-last in expected goal differential (minus-0.79) while the latter ranks third-to-last (minus-0.3). A big part of the problem for both countries is that neither one has been able to successfully turn over their team. The average age of Peru's squad is 28.9, while Chile aren't far behind at 28.6 -- both significantly older than any other team in the tournament.\n\nCanada, meanwhile, come into the tournament with one of the younger squads: 25.6. And the likes of Bayern Munich's Alphonso Davies and Lille's Jonathan David give them higher-end talent than either Chile or Peru. Given how the managerial economy works -- the best coaches get filtered up to the club game -- Canada's hiring of Marsch could also give them one of the best coaches in the tournament.\n\nThis is the weakest group in the tournament. Not only that but the winner of Group B will also get to play the second-place team in Group A, which is likely to be the weakest second-place team in the tournament.\n\nLuck of the draw plays a bigger role in tournament soccer than anyone would like to admit (see: Croatia's run to the 2018 World Cup final), and Mexico and Ecuador both got lucky before a game was even played.\n\nAlthough El Tri feel like they're at their lowest point in, I don't know, 25 years, they got a cushy draw and will have a bigger home-field advantage than any other team in the tournament. Without the underlying quality of the talent or even the recent performances changing at all, Mexico could very easily make the semis and suddenly change the vibe surrounding the program.\n\nWith the second-youngest team in the tournament, budding young stars in Europe such as Chelsea's Mois\u00e9s Caicedo and Bayer Leverkusen's Piero Hincapi\u00e9, a solid start to World Cup qualifying (11 points, fourth place), and the favorable draw, Ecuador look like a classic dark-horse pick. The only problem: They don't have anyone who can score goals. Only Peru and Bolivia have created fewer xG in South American World Cup qualifying, and their leading scorer is F\u00e9lix Torres, who plays center back.\n\nVenezuela tied Ecuador in a relatively even home match at the end of last year and they also drew with Brazil -- in Brazil -- a few months prior. They cross the ball an absurd amount: 28% of their final-third passes in World Cup qualifying have been crosses -- way higher than any other team. That's generally an incredibly inefficient strategy, but maybe its uniqueness throws their opponents off-balance.\n\nJamaica's rating here is a bit inflated because of the inclusion of Aston Villa's Leon Bailey. He was genuinely one of the best attackers in Europe last season, and although he was called up to the Copa America squad, it appears he's going to reject the invitation as part of a protest against the unprofessionalism of the Jamaican federation. (History is certainly on his side here.) The likes of West Ham's Michail Antonio and former Everton winger Demarai Gray are interesting names on paper, but neither one is as dangerous as he used to be.\n\nEcuador 1, Venezuela 0\n\nMexico 2, Jamaica, 1\n\nEcuador 1, Jamaica 0\n\nMexico 1, Venezuela 1\n\nVenezuela 2, Jamaica 1\n\nMexico 2, Ecuador 1\n\n1. Mexico: 7 points, plus-2 goal differential\n\n2. Ecuador: 6 points, plus-1 goal differential\n\n3. Venezuela; 4 points, even goal differential\n\n4. Jamaica: 1 points, minus-2 goal differential\n\nUruguay: 67.0 rating (3rd), 93.5% chance of reaching quarterfinals (per ESPN BET)\n\nUnited States: 36.6 rating (6th), 85.9% chance\n\nPanama: 15.0 rating (13th), 12.6% chance\n\nBol\u00edvia: 0.0 rating (16th), 12.3% chance\n\nAlthough Group B has the lowest average rating among its four teams, Group C has the weakest bottom two. As such, only Argentina has better odds to reach the quarterfinals than Uruguay, while those two, plus Brazil, are the only sides with a higher likelihood of advancing than the U.S. men's national team.\n\nAfter Brazil and Argentina, Uruguay have the third most talented squad in the tournament. In Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Federico Valverde, Manuel Ugarte, Ronald Araujo, Rodrigo Bentancur, and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez, they have six players who are at least Champions League-starter level. And at 37 and without functional knees, Luis Su\u00e1rez continues to absolutely demolish whatever league he plays in. He was the best player in Brazil last year, and he's been lights out with Inter Miami so far this season, too.\n\nThrow in Marcelo Bielsa, easily the most accomplished coach in the tournament, and you've got the first-place side in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying. Unlike most international sides, Uruguay wants the game to be played in transition. Bielsa prefers for the ball to constantly be switching hands because he thinks he's better at coaching these situations than anyone else in the world. In N\u00fa\u00f1ez and Valverde, he has two of the best transition players in world soccer, too.\n\nWe should learn a lot about the USMNT when these two teams meet in Kansas City. The Americans are massive favorites against Bolivia -- only Brazil (against Costa Rica) have shorter odds on Matchday 1 -- and they should be heavy favorites against Panama, too.\n\nThe most likely outcome is that both the U.S. and Uruguay have six points when they meet at the beginning of next month. In that case, they'll both already be qualified. Sometimes that leads to 90 minutes of both teams staring at the ball, but I'm not sure Bielsa teams are capable of staring at the ball for 90 minutes. With their defined tactical approach and top-end talent, Uruguay might be the trickiest team the USMNT has faced in the Gregg Berhalter era.\n\nAs for the rest of the group: Bolivia are the worst team in the tournament. They have the worst results and the least talented squad. Without the advantage of playing at altitude in La Paz, they've been uncompetitive for a long time. Panama, meanwhile, took down the U.S. B- or C-team in the Gold Cup semifinals last summer. They also notched an impressive 3-0 win in Costa Rica back in November of last year, and they actually outshot Mexico, 18-6, in a 3-0 semifinal loss in the Nations League that was much closer than the final score.\n\nThis isn't your vintage Brazil. There's no Neymar, you've possibly never heard of the fullbacks, and the midfielders almost all play for midtable Premier League clubs.\n\nAnd yet, the forward line will include some combination of Real Madrid's Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, Real Madrid's Rodrygo, Barcelona's Raphinha, Arsenal's Gabriel Martinelli, and the duo of phenom prospects in formerly-Girona-but-maybe-Manchester City's S\u00e1vio and Real Madrid's 17-year-old Endrick. Newcastle's Bruno Guimar\u00e3es and Atalanta's \u00c9derson were two of the best two-way midfielders in Europe this past season. The potential starting center backs play for PSG, Real Madrid, and Arsenal. And Liverpool's Alisson is the best all-around goalkeeper in the world.\n\nBrazil's results in qualifying have been substandard so far, but there's just too much talent for that to continue.\n\nColombia, meanwhile, haven't lost a game since February 2022, and that was against Argentina, in Argentina. They've moved up to fifth in the Elo ratings in the process, behind Argentina, France, Brazil, and Spain -- in that order. Liverpool's Luis D\u00edaz is their one star -- and their squad value ranks fifth among all teams in the tournament, behind the USMNT, whom they just destroyed 5-1 in a pre-tournament friendly.\n\nPerhaps most pertinent: Colombia's previous two opponents in World Cup qualifying were group stage opponents Paraguay and Brazil. They won both matches, and created the better chances in each one.\n\nParaguay have one of the most exciting young players in the world -- 20-year-old Brighton attacking midfielder Julio Enciso -- but there's not a ton of other talent behind him. Not one of their six World Cup qualifying matches has featured more than one total goal -- there have been two total non-penalty goals scored across those games.\n\nIncredibly, Costa Rica bring the youngest average team to the Copa America. They had the oldest team at the 2022 World Cup. It was time to turn the team over from their golden generation, but that also means that this is no longer Costa Rica's golden generation. Their recent results have dropped them down to 59th in the Elo ratings -- worse than every team in the tournament other than Bolivia.\n\nThe past two times these two teams played, in World Cup qualifying and in a pre-Copa tune-up, both games ended 1-0 to Argentina. Over those two games, Ecuador attempted just eight total shots.\n\nAlthough the presence of Messi is the main attraction, Argentina were a dominant defensive team in Qatar. That has remained true in World Cup qualifying -- they've conceded just 2.3 non-penalty xG across six matches.\n\nPredicted result: Argentina 1, Ecuador 0\n\nBoth of these teams would seem like \"surprise\" semifinalists -- Mexico because of their recent struggles, and Canada because they're, well, Canada. But the Canadians landed in a group without a strong second team after Argentina, and Mexico are currently the betting favorites to meet Argentina in the semifinals.\n\nHot tip: When the betting markets suggest that something counter to conventional wisdom is the most likely outcome, adopt it as your own opinion and impress your friends at a rate higher than expectation.\n\nPredicted result: Mexico 2, Canada 1\n\nWatching the World Cup qualifying match between these two teams induced emotional effects similar to those normally only associated with various illicit substances. Possession was almost even, both teams pressed high, they combined for 29 shots, and they created nearly 4.0 xG together. It ended 2-2, after a Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez goal in injury time.\n\nThe big difference in the Copa America? This match won't be in Colombia.\n\nPredicted result: Uruguay 2, Colombia 1\n\nAt 21, Ricardo Pepi has never played in an international tournament, but he gets it. \"I think anything besides making it out of the group will be bad for us, so we just want to be able to compete and get the best out of it,\" he told ESPN. And that's just the reality facing the Americans.\n\nThey should get out of the group -- the gap between them and Panama and Bolivia is big enough that not even bad luck should sink them. But after that, they're just not at the same level as Colombia or Brazil, their most likely quarterfinal opponents.\n\nYes, they did just draw the Brazilians in a friendly last week, but they were outshot 24-12 and all of their high-quality chances came after the game devolved in the second half, like most friendlies do once substitutions are made:\n\nThe USMNT's best bet for reaching the quarterfinals would be to win the group or hope Colombia win Group D.\n\nIn the Copa America, there's no extra time until the final -- a silly format that encourages underdogs to just try to hang on for dear life until the 90-minute mark so they can get to the coin flip of penalties. However, that format does favor the underdogs, which the USMNT will likely be if it makes it this far.\n\nPredicted result: Brazil 3, United States 1\n\nThat Argentina percentage above represents both how random soccer is and how much better Argentina is than every other team on their side of the bracket. Despite being so much better than everyone else, it's still just about a coin flip that Messi & Co. reach the final game.\n\nBut if, say, every team in the tournament were equally matched, there would be a 12.5% chance (one in eight) that you'd reach the final. Argentina's odds are more than four times as high.\n\nPredicted result: Argentina 2, Mexico 0\n\nWhen these teams met in World Cup qualifying, they played a truly bizarre match where Brazil maintained 61% of possession but were outshot 6-2 and lost the game 2-0. Then-manager Fernando Diniz's free-flowing possession tactics worked horribly with the national team.\n\nI suspect -- and most projection models agree -- that Brazil will play up to their talent level this summer with a new manager who doesn't try to reinvent the wheel. They have the best goalkeeper in the tournament and the most attacking talent. This shouldn't be that complicated.\n\nPredicted result: Brazil 1, Uruguay 1 (Brazil advances in a shootout)\n\nA rematch of the past two finals -- a rubber match of sorts, with Brazil taking the title in 2019 and Argentina in 2021. While Brazil have the most talented team in the tournament, we're still working off a bit of projection here. They've lost their past three competitive matches, and we haven't seen the team play a non-friendly match under manager Dorival J\u00fanior yet. Plus, they're probably going to have to beat at least two of Uruguay, Colombia, and the USMNT -- Nos. 3, 4, and 6 in our rankings -- to get to the final.\n\nArgentina, though, are maybe the most known quantity in international soccer: be defensively tough, have everyone else do the running for Messi on and off the ball, and then let Messi win the game once you have possession. We'll see how effective Messi remains after a year of playing MLS and, simply, another year of aging, but this simplified formula just works so well in the international game.\n\nIt's really hard to Argentina screwing it up before the final. And with the title match in Miami, Argentina's captain will be playing at home. After years of the opposite being true, you bet against Messi and Argentina at your own risk.\n\nPredicted result: Argentina 1, Brazil 0\n\nSo ... congratulations to Argentina, the 2024 Copa America champions!", "source": {"uri": "insider.espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com (Insider)"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification",

I don't need to commit right now to whether or not I'll be there,\" he added.\n\nWhat is certain is that Messi, who has managed his workload to try to be in peak condition for the tournament, would relish the chance to win a third straight major tournament with his country after so many years of frustration with his national team.\n\nAfter facing Canada, Argentina take on Chile in New Jersey before finishing their Group A action against Peru in Miami but they know that tough opposition awaits in the knockout stage with rivals Brazil and Uruguay the two expected challengers for the title.

With a varying number of teams over the years, the tournament celebrates the skill and cultural diversity of South American football, with giants like Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil frequently contending for the title.\n\nCopa Am\u00e9rica's role in football history is immense, with legendary participant players like Pel\u00e9, Diego Maradona, and Lionel Messi contributing to its storied legacy. Victories in the tournament often lead to national jubilation, encapsulating the significant cultural and emotional investment of the fans.\n\nThe cultural impact of Copa Am\u00e9rica extends beyond football, influencing music, art, and literature, and acts as a unifying force that transcends national boundaries.

The tournament will take place in the United States for the first time since 2016 as all 10 CONMEBOL teams will participate alongside six Concacaf sides who qualified via Concacaf Nations League play. Before the tournament begins, it's a good time to check in on how all 16 teams are trending:\n\nRankTeamBlurb\n\nArgentina\n\nYou can't start at the top of Copa America rankings without beginning with Argentina who are doing a good job of balancing the current stars with bringing along younger players as well. With his next appearance, Lionel Messi will set the record for caps in this competition with 35 while also looking to lead his team to back -to-back Copa America titles.\n\nUruguay\n\nLuis Suarez is back in the international picture for Uruguay as Marcelo Bielsa has the team rounding into form at the best time possible. Getting the best out of Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez will be important but so will Facundo Pellistri's service and pressing from the wing. From back to front, this is a solid squad with depth to challenge anyone in the tournament.\n\nColombia\n\nIt almost feels like 2a and 2b between Uruguay and Colombia as Los Cafeteros come into this tournament unbeaten in 23 consecutive games. Taking out the United States, Spain, and Brazil during this run, Colombia can't be underestimated as a contender for the crown.\n\n4\n\nBrazil\n\nThis team isn't balanced under Dorival J\u00fanior but they have so much attacking talent that won't see them slip below being a top contender. It's also a tournament where 17-year-old Endrick can make his mark before joining Real Madrid during the summer following his 18th birthday. At some point, a full Real Madrid attack of Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, and Endrick could make an appearance.\n\n5\n\nUnited States\n\nChristian Pulisic is back where he made his tournament debut for the United States in Copa America 2016 with high expectations. The USMNT have had highs and lows in qualifying for this tournament but they are still among the top contenders to make it to the round of 16. With a tough draw, their run may end there though.\n\nEcuador\n\nEnner Valencia along with Kendry P\u00e1ez shows a balance between Ecuador's past and present as they're ready to show what they can do in this tournament. Suffering narrow losses to Argentina and Italy, Ecuador can defend well but needs to balance things better in attack to reach their full potential.\n\n7\n\nMexico\n\nI struggle with where to place Mexico. On one hand, Mexico can score goals when Uriel Antuna is tuned in, but defensively, El Tri can't keep up with top teams. They bounced back from losing to Uruguay but allowing seven goals in two games of preparation for Copa America doesn't inspire confidence.\n\n8\n\nVenezuela\n\nA hard team to rank, Venezuela haven't played a match since March when they drew against Guatemala. With a stout defense and Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n leading the line, this Venezuela team can get results but having such a long layoff before a major tournament could come back to bite them.\n\n9\n\nCanada\n\nWe're in the early days of Jesse Marsch leading the Canucks but they've already secured a marquee result drawing against France in a friendly. Canada will need to gel and improve their play in midfield but with Alphonso Davies and Johnathan David leading the team, they can pull out results.\n\n10\n\nJamaica\n\nLeon Bailey is back ... well technically he's on the roster but not expected to show up for Copa America after calling out the federation, but the Reggae Boyz are also without stalwart Andre Blake at least to start the tournament, which is quite a blow defensively. When there is more noise off the pitch than on it, it's tough to make headway in an international tournament.\n\n11\n\nParaguay\n\nIt's a very young Paraguay team that, while moving in the right direction, makes you wonder if they'll actually be able to stand up to stiffer opposition. Brighton man Julio Enciso will have a large role in whatever Paraguay do but he also needs help.\n\n12\n\nPanama\n\nMaking a run to the Nations League semifinal, Panama have shined, especially in midfield led by Adalberto Carrasquilla. They now need to kick into a new gear. If Panama can somehow make it out of the group stage, that's when we're looking at something special.\n\n13\n\nChile\n\nLikely with the highest average age in the tournament, it's hard to find something to like about this Chile squad. They'll get their goals but when faced with a fitter team that isn't drawn into a physical battle, they'll falter.\n\n14\n\nCosta Rica\n\nMoving on from their golden generation, Costa Rica will enter their first tournament without Keylor Navas since 2008. Manfred Ugalde is an up-and-coming young striker and Joel Campbell is still involved but it does leave questions to answer.\n\n15\n\nBolivia\n\nAnother team in transition, Bolivia don't have a focal point in attack now that their record goal scorer Marcelo Moreno has retired. Just giving a good account of themselves and beginning to establish a platform for the future is the goal.\n\n16\n\nPeru\n\nPeru is essentially Chile but with less star power. Bottom of the table of World Cup qualifying, this is a team just looking for a positive heading into Copa America and they're hard to come by.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news",

While he feels no pressure to capture a second straight major international tournament, he would like to add his already lasting legacy.\n\n\"I enjoy my time with the national team, where I also have good friends, too, and a lot. I enjoy those small details that I know I'll miss when I stop playing,\" he added.\n\nArgentina is tied with Uruguay for the most Copa Am\u00e9rica titles with 15. However, Argentina is on one of the best runs of any National Team in the world and has won 13 of 14 matches since winning the World Cup two years ago.\n\nArgentina also has Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez, who shined in the team's recent 4-1 victory over Guatemala in a Copa Am\u00e9rica warmup.\n\nBrazil is the second favorite, ahead of Uruguay, Colombia, Mexico, and the United States.\n\nBrazil finished second in the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica behind Argentina and has a deep and talented roster that includes Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo Silva de Goes (commonly known as Rodrygo), who recently won the 2023-24 Champions League title with Real Madrid.\n\nHowever, the Brazilians were recently criticized for their recent performance in a 1-1 tie with the United States in an international friendly. Brazilian star Ronaldinho Ga\u00facho (commonly known as Ronaldinho) was especially upset with the performance and went on social media to voice his concerns about the direction of the National Team.\n\n\"I've been following football since I was a kid, long before I thought about becoming a player, and I've never seen a situation as bad as this,\" he said.\n\n\"There's a lack of love for the shirt, a lack of determination, and most importantly [a lack of] football. The performance has been one of the worst things I've ever seen. It's a shame. That's why I declare I'm giving up here. I won't watch any CONMEBOL Copa Am\u00e9rica games, and I won't celebrate if Brazil wins,\" he added.\n\nRonaldinho later backtracked on those harsh comments.\n\nUruguay had a dominant 4-0 win over Mexico in a final pre-tournament friendly on June 5.\n\nEdson \u00c1lvarez (West Ham United) will keep the midfield organized and help set a potent attack that includes Santiago Gim\u00e9nez (Feyenoord).\n\nAfter a deflating 5-1 loss to emerging powerhouse Colombia, the United States bounced back by tying Brazil. U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter selected a young roster with an average age of 25 years and 230 days. It is the second-youngest squad the USA has sent to five editions of the Copa Am\u00e9rica, behind only the 2007 team.\n\nForward Christian Pulisic (AC Milan) and goalkeeper Ethan Horvath (Cardiff City) make their second Copa Am\u00e9rica rosters, with the duo being part of the 2016 Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario squad.\n\nPulisic, who has three Copa Am\u00e9rica appearances, is also the leading cap-winner on the roster (68), followed by Tim Ream (58), Weston McKennie (53), Antonee Robinson (43), and Matt Turner (41).\n\nEighteen of the 26 U.S. players were on the 2022 FIFA World Cup

He is either tied for second with Ali Daei or one behind, depending on whether a disputed goal by the Iranian is counted, trailing only Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo at 128.\n\n\"It is not easy to compete again after winning it all,\" Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said.\n\n\"If you look at every position in their proposed starting 11, it's probably one of the world's best players,\" U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter said.\n\nSpain is the only nation to win three consecutive major titles: the European Championship in 2008 and 2012 around the 2010 World Cup.\n\nEcuador was to host the tournament under the rotation of CONMEBOL, South American soccer's governing body, but declined. The tournament was then moved to the U.S., which also hosted the special centennial Copa Am\u00e9rica in 2016 as Chile won on penalty kicks over Argentina at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\nEleven NFL stadiums are being used, including eight of the 11 U.S. venues for the 2026 World Cup, plus three smaller MLS homes. The final will be at Miami Gardens, Florida, on July 14, starting five hours after the European Championship final in Berlin.\n\nCONMEBOL says more than 1 million tickets have been sold for the 32 matches. The 2016 tournament drew just under 1.5 million, and the 2019 tournament in Brazil about 850,000. The 2021 Copa was played mostly without fans because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThis will be the biggest test for the U.S. team before the World Cup -- the Americans get an automatic berth as co-host along with Mexico and Canada -- and most Europe-based players are expected to skip next year's CONCACAF Gold Cup.\n\nChristian Pulisic, Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie are the core of a team that returns 18 players from the 2022 World Cup roster.\n\n\"A World Cup on home soil is the biggest thing that you know we'll probably do in our career,\" Pulisic said. \"It's a special time for this sport in America.\"\n\nIn 2016, CONMEBOL partnered with the U.S. Soccer Federation, which was in charge of most of the logistics. This time, CONMEBOL is co-organizing the tournament with CONCACAF, the governing body of North and Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nUnlike during the World Cup, the organizers have only short-term access to venues. At Hard Rock, a concert is scheduled for July 6, between the last group stage game and the final, and a new grass surface will be installed.\n\n[Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

The stadium has a camera system designed by Arecont Vision and managed by Genetec Security Center that was installed before the 2014 Super Bowl and a new system by Axis Communications is being put in place this summer in the seating bowl with 80 8K, 41-megapixel cameras.\n\n\"We can see every seat all the time. I think it serves as a good deterrent,\" said Daniel DeLorenzi, vice president of security and safety services. \"We have three drone detection systems. ...

Brazil will be keen on retaking its perch as a blue-chip world power while the United States and Mexico want to prove that they belong in the conversation of the world's best as they prepare to joint-host the 2026 World Cup.\n\nThe defending Copa America and World Cup champions are the obvious favorites as they run it back at least one more time with the great Lionel Mesi. But the little maestro is now 39 years old and playing his club soccer in the United States. Meanwhile, Argentina's build-up to Copa America was not all too challenging. Is this the time they are knocked off their perch?\n\nJesse Marsch, who is familiar around these parts (former NY Red Bulls manager) has only had one month to work with his new team, which continues to play on big stages after making its debut at the World Cup two years ago. The Canadians are an intriguing team at their first-ever Copa America and could surprise some people. Davies is a superstar and Moise Bombito of Colorado Rapids has bolstered a backline that has always been weak. Up front, Jonathan David scored 26 goals for Ligue 1 side Lille.\n\nAfter back-to-back Copa America titles nearly a decade ago, times have been lean for Chile. Alexis Sanchez is still their star man at 35 years old and still plenty productive, contributing for Serie A champions Inter Milan. Perhaps the 20-year-old Dario Osorio can take the torch from Sanchez as Chile's next big star, but expectations are low in 2024.\n\nPeru has plenty of doubters after their best player, Renato Tapia of Celta Vigo in La Liga, abandoned the national team after clashing with the country's soccer federation. Piero Quispe had a promising start with Pumas UNAM in Mexico and Orlando City keeper Pedro Gallese is a steady presence in goal.\n\nCopa America 2024 Group A schedule\n\nA bulk of Ecuador's hopes rest on a pair of Chelsea products. Moises Caicedo struggled mightily in his first season with the West London giants after starring for Brighton & Hove Albion, but he is the undoubted Ecuadorian talisman at just 22 years old. Five years younger than Caicedo is Kendry Paez -- a 17-year-old attacking midfielder who is joining the Premier League club next season as a can't-miss prospect. They are not the favorites, but they will be a fun, bright team to watch.\n\nJamaica is still waiting for their star striker to replicate his club form on the international scene. The Reggae Boyz will be up against it with a squad sapped by injuries. They have never won a Copa America match in six tries and will have to surprise some prognosticators just to prove that they are not the worst team in the group.\n\nAnother West Ham star is the heartbeat of El Tri as a holding midfielder that brings organization and resolve to a team that desperately needs it. Santiago Gimenez is just 23 years old and is coming off a 23-goal season with Dutch giants Feyenoord, headlining a roster that is filled with fresh faces. Gone are the days of Hirving Lozano, Raul Jimenez, and Memo Ochoa. Still, this is a strong enough team to advance out of the group -- even win it.\n\nThe Venezuelans have their star man up front, which couldn't be said during their World Cup qualifying when he was stuck abroad due to COVID restrictions. This tournament is paramount to build the confidence to qualify for a World Cup for the first time ever. A strong showing at the Copa America does just that. Watch out for Fortaleza's Kervin Andrade as a dark horse to star in this group. He is a 19-year-old attacking midfielder with a nose for goal.\n\nCopa America 2024 Group B schedule\n\nThe lowest-ranked team in the tournament, Bolivia appears to be a sacrificial lamb for the United States to start their tournament on the right foot.\n\nDespite being one of the lower-ranked teams on the scene, Panama made the 2023 Gold Cup final and had a top-four finish in the 2023-24 Nations League. Carrasquilla is a dynamic midfielder who can pull the strings of Panama's attack while fullback Michael Murrillo is plying his trade with Ligue 1 giants Marseille.\n\nPulisic has been the face of the Americans' youthful revolution for more than five years and he has lived up to the high expectations. But the Americans are rich with young talent playing in top European leagues whether it be Bournemouth's Tyler Adams or Juventus' Weston McKennie and Timothy Weah, or Pulisic's AC Milan teammate, Yunus Musah, or Monaco's Folarin Balogun. You get what I'm saying, here. This team is far too talented to not advance out of this group -- though a matchup with Argentina or Brazil could await in the quarterfinals.\n\nOne of the most successful teams on the Copa America stage, Uruguay knows what it takes to win this tournament. Federico Valverde comes from the finest European program in Real Madrid and Facundo Pellistri is still a top player even if Manchester United continues to loan him out. Manager Marcelo Bielsa plays a relentless, pacy style and Uruguay has the talent to do so like Liverpool's Darwin Nunez. They are also stable at the back with top talent in tow. Barcelona's Ronald Araujo and Atletico Madrid's Jose Gimenez anchor the back line with support from PSG's Manuel Ugarte.\n\nCopa America 2024 Group C schedule\n\nBrazil is officially Vinicius Junior's team after the young attacker won his second Champions League crown in three years. He is one of the very best players on the planet right now and will be flanked with plenty of La Liga talent whether it be his Real Madrid teammate Rodrygo or Barcelona's Raphinha. But 2023 was a rough year for Brazil, they have gone a mediocre 5-3-4 over the last 12 months, and they have a new coach in Dorival Junior. They need to hit a different gear if they want to advance through the tougher half of this tournament.\n\nColombia is in fine form after thumping the Americans 5-1 in a June 8 friendly. In fact, they haven't lost a game in a year. Luis Diaz is the talisman but familiar faces like James Rodriguez makes this team one of the favorites to win this tournament.\n\nCosta Rica has some promising young talent up front with Aguilera and Spartak Moscow's Manfred Ugalde. However, the absence of national legend and goalkeeper Kaylor Navas provides an uncertain new world for the Costa Ricans.\n\nAlmiron has starred at the domestic level wherever he has gone, most recently with Newcastle in the Premier League. But he has just two goals in his international career and has to do more if his side has any chance of succeeding at the Copa America.", "source": {"uri": "amny.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Given the odds, Argentina should win this game, but our soccer expert Chris Vasile believes Canada can trouble their backline.\n\nCopa America 2024 gets underway on Thursday with Argentina -- the defending champions -- taking on tournament debutants, Canada.\n\nGiven the Copa America odds for this fixture, Argentina should collect all three points, but it won't be without a fight.\n\nFind out why my Argentina vs. Canada predictions have the Canadians finding the back of the net.\n\nArgentina vs Canada picks, predictions, and betting tips\n\nMy best bet:\n\nBoth teams to score -- Yes (+115 at Betano)\n\nMy analysis\n\nLet's start this analysis by calling a spade a spade. Argentina is far and away the deeper and more complete team, and given where the odds sit for this fixture, they should come away with all three points. However, it won't be without a fight.\n\nCanada, while making their Copa America debut, has enough firepower up front to trouble Argentina's back line.\n\nJonathan David, who finished second in Ligue 1 scoring to Kylian Mbappe, will once again be the focal point in attack with Cyle Larin likely playing beside him in a more traditional 4-4-2 formation. Canada will have plenty of men behind the ball and should be able to provide service to the front two more often than not.\n\nIf we throw Alphonso Davies into the mix from his left-back/left-wing position, I believe Canada's best form of defense will be to venture forward as often as possible.\n\nNow, that's easier said than done against the reigning World Cup and Copa America champions, but Argentina's defense has been far from impenetrable -- giving up a goal to Guatemala and Costa Rica in the lead-up to the tournament.\n\nMake no mistake about it, Arengtina will likely collect all three points here, but the Canadians will not go down without a fight.\n\nMy analysis\n\nCometh the hour, cometh the man, and Lionel Messi is the man for the job.\n\nHe's in excellent form for both club and country, netting 12 goals in 12 matches for Inter Miami and scoring twice for Argentina in their last friendly vs. Guatemala.\n\nAs is always the case with Messi, the offense flows through him, and with plenty of options and talent around him, Messi will not only play the role of provider, but he should have plenty of opportunity to bury one as well.\n\nArgentina vs Canada same-game parlay (SGP)\n\nIn addition to my best bet and Lionel Messi player prop, I'll include the Over 1.5 second-half goals.\n\nI believe we are in for a treat on Thursday with both teams trading chances and this game finishing with upwards of five or six goals.\n\nWith Canada's best game plan being to attack every opportunity, Argentina could set themselves up nicely to hit on the counterattack.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonso_Davies", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphonso Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyle_Larin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyle Larin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Formation (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligue_1", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ligue 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guatemala"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Guatemala"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Costa Rica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Costa Rica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/0b3ed257-71c2-4025-a2d7-d3c58776f86d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658543", "eventUri": "eng-9658543", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

The United States, which hosted the competition in 2016, returns with hosting duties for the second time. Yet, that is not the only change. There are more teams, games, and stadiums with the same excitement the tournament already delivers.\n\nThe biggest change is the expansion of the competition to 16 teams. Every tournament from 1993 onward has featured 12 teams. Ten of those are representatives of CONMEBOL, the confederation of South America. The other two have been invitees. That has included the United States on several occasions, as well as Mexico. El Tri is the only invitee to reach a Copa America Final, having accomplished that feat twice.\n\nIn 2024, all 10 CONMEBOL will compete. The other six teams all come from North America and the Caribbean. The four semifinalists from the most recent CONCACAF Nations League earned a spot. Those are the United States, Mexico, Jamaica and Panama. Canada and Costa Rica needed to qualify via playoffs, but they reached the group stage nonetheless.\n\nWith a tournament of this size, it's important to have the necessary information. Whether that be where to watch games on TV or in person, or maybe you want to see more team information as the tournament approaches. World Soccer Talk has all the tools to stay updated with the tournament leading up to and throughout the summer.\n\nThe 2024 Copa America TV schedule runs through FOX. The broadcaster is using three channels to broadcast the games of the Copa America. Seven games are available on FOX, while three are on Fox Sports 2. That leaves the other 22 to Fox Sports 1, making it the de facto home of the Copa America in the United States.\n\nEach of those three channels is available on most cable and satellite TV packages. Additionally, FOX is available over the air, meaning all you would need is an antenna. Cord-cutters can access these channels through pay-TV providers like Fubo.\n\nFOX has already allotted the schedule for where it is broadcasting each of the 32 games. The Copa America TV schedule for this summer shows when each game is happening and the channels and outlets to watch.\n\nIf you want to take it one step further, World Soccer Talk has ticket information for every game you can attend. That includes the Copa America Final at Hard Rock Stadium on July 14.\n\nWorld Soccer Talk is a partner of Vivid Seats, a ticketing platform where you can buy a seat to any Copa America game. World Soccer Talk readers can take advantage of a discount on Vivid Seats that takes $20 off your order using the code SOCCER20 at checkout.\n\nIf you know how to watch the games, or maybe you're attending, it would help to know the background and history of this phenomenal competition. the Copa America beginner's guide discusses the format of this tournament, which heavily differs from the simultaneous European Championship from UEFA.\n\nWhether it be a squad announcement, a key injury, or any major occurrence, World Soccer Talk has updates before and during the tournament on our Copa America page.", "source": {"uri": "worldsoccertalk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Soccer Talk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica",

Subscribe to Sideline, a pop-up newsletter for the summer.\n\nThis major men's soccer championship features South American national teams with a select group of North American and Caribbean teams. The 2024 event, with a total of 32 matches played across 14 U.S. cities, is only the second time the tournament has been held outside of South America in the past 50 years.\n\nAmericans have jumped at the chance to see these international soccer stars in action, especially the opening match. With the notion of Lionel Messi playing in the ATL making nosebleed ticket sales rival the price of last year's Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, local fans are sure to bring high energy to this anticipated game.\n\nIn Copa Am\u00e9rica Group A, which includes Argentina, Canada, Peru and Chile, all eyes immediately go to Argentina, the defending FIFA World Cup champions. Still ranked No. 1 in the world after winning 13 of 14 matches since their 2022 World Cup victory, \"La Albiceleste\" are favored to repeat as South American champions.\n\nIn contrast, Canada's road to their first-ever Copa Am\u00e9rica has been tumultuous. First, the young squad fell short of the hype they received going into the 2022 World Cup when they were knocked out in the Group Stage of the tournament. Then, in 2023, Canada barely qualified for this tournament by defeating Trinidad and Tobago following a loss to Jamaica in the CONCACAF Nations League quarterfinal.\n\nOff the pitch, Canada Soccer has been grappling with financial woes and disputes with the women's team over equal pay. Now, with American coach Jesse March at the helm for his first competitive match with the team, Canada strives to make a statement against Messi and crew.\n\nOf course, it's hard to think of Argentinian soccer without Lionel Messi coming to mind. Often heralded as the \"GOAT\" of soccer, the captain of Argentina has recently transitioned his illustrious career from Barcelona to MLS team Inter Miami FC. To say Messi has made a mark on this new team would be an understatement; in just 12 games this 2024 season, Messi has scored 12 goals and assisted 13.\n\nOther notable Argentine players include forward Julian Alvarez and defender Cristian Romero. Alvarez had a stellar season, helping secure his English Premier League team Manchester City a record fourth straight English top flight title this past year. Alvarez had 11 goals and 9 assists in 36 matches. Also playing for an English side, Cristian Romero has been a defensive powerhouse for Tottenham Hotspur this year and should be a force to reckon with this Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\nUnfortunately, Atlanta United's best and brightest, Thiago Almada, will not make an appearance in this tournament as he prepares for the 2024 Olympic Games with Argentina's U-23 squad. Back in February, Almada was instrumental in leading the Argentina national men's U-23 team to a 1-0 victory over Brazil to secure tickets to Paris.\n\nOn Canada's side, international stars Alphonso Davies and Jonathan David are hard to miss. Davies, named team captain for this tournament despite being a young defender, has established himself as a crucial player for powerhouse German team Bayern Munich. His leadership will undoubtedly fortify Canada's often weaker back line. Meanwhile, forward David in his season for Ligue 1 side Lille has been none other than impressive, scoring 26 goals in all competitions. David's ability to find the back of the net should give Canada the edge they need going forward in the tournament.\n\n\"Atlanta's ultimate soccer bar,\" Brewhouse, promises a high-energy crowd for this game.\n\nFad\u00f3 Buckhead will be showing all European Championship and Copa Am\u00e9rica games.\n\nWild Leap will host a pregame party starting at 4 p.m. It is walking distance from Mercedes-Benz, so either grab a bite to eat before heading to the game or stay for the celebration.\n\nMARTA and Soccer in the Streets will host a watch party at West End Station to kick off the Copa Am\u00e9rica international men's soccer tournament.\n\nAll games will be televised live on FOX Sports (FOX and FS1) and on TUDN.", "source": {"uri": "roughdraftatlanta.com", "dataType": "news",

Latest odds and predictions | How to watch all the Copa America action\n\nThis Copa America 2024 match kicks off from Mercedes-Benz Stadium on June 20 at 8:00 p.m. local time in Atlanta.\n\nHere's how that time translates across all of the time zones in North America:\n\nUSA: Argentina vs. Canada from Mercedes-Benz Stadium will be televised in the United States on FS1, with a Spanish-language broadcast via TUDN USA and Univision. Those channels are available to stream on Fubo, who are offering a FREE seven-day trial. ViX is also providing a Spanish-language stream.\n\nCanada: Copa America matches can be seen in Canada on TSN's respective TV channel and live streaming services.

Martinez had his fair share of injuries for Manchester United in 2023/24 but returned for the FA Cup final and started both warm-up games.\n\nArgentina projected starting lineup (4-4-2): Martinez (GK) -- Molina, Romero, Martinez, Tagliafico -- De Paul, Fernandez, Mac Allister, Lo Celso -- Messi, Martinez.\n\nSince Jesse Marsch took charge of the Canada national team, they've used a 4-4-2 formation with Orlando City's Cyle Larin and Jonathan David leading the attack.\n\nInter Milan's Tajon Buchanan has been utilised out on the right with Derek Cornelius commanding from the back.\n\nCanada projected starting lineup (4-4-2): Crepeau (GK) -- Johnston, Bombito, Cornelius, Davis -- Buchanan, Kone, Eustaquio, Millar -- Larin, David.\n\nWith Canada making their debut in this tournament, Lionel Messi's World Cup winners Argentina should be too much for Jesse Marsch's side to handle.\n\nMessi bagged a brace against Guatemala and his record his national side has continuously proven his worth.\n\nCanada did, however, hold Kylian Mbappe's France to a 0-0 draw as the European side prepared for the Euro 2024 tournament.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news",

I don't need to commit right now to whether or not I'll be there.\"\n\nWhat is certain is that Messi, who has managed his workload at Inter Miami to try to be in peak condition for the Copa, would relish the chance to win a third straight major tournament with his country after so many years of frustration with his national team.\n\nAfter facing Canada, Argentina take on Chile in New Jersey before finishing their Group A action against Peru in Miami but they know that tough opposition awaits in the knockout stage with rivals Brazil and Uruguay the two expected challengers for the title.\n\nBrazil have struggled in Conmebol qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup, having won just two of their opening six games and they currently sit in sixth place in the standings.\n\nThere are several familiar names missing from Dorival Junior's Brazil squad with Casemiro, Gabriel Jesus and Thiago Silva left out while Richarlison and Neymar are both missing due to injury.\n\nThe pressure will be on the Real Madrid attacking pair of Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo to translate their club form into success for the Selecao while there is also much excitement around the senior tournament debut of 17-year-old talent Endrick, who is set to join Real from Palmeiras in July.\n\nUruguay, also 15-time winners, have impressed under their Argentinian coach Marcelo Bielsa, who has brought his trademark high-energy style to the team and raised expectations with recent wins over Argentina and Brazil.\n\nLiverpool forward Darwin Nunez will lead the line although Bielsa has the option of introducing veteran Luis Suarez from the bench.\n\nColombia head into the tournament without a loss in over two years and with Liverpool's livewire winger Luis Diaz a constant threat and James Rodriguez enjoying a late career revival, Nestor Lorenzo's team cannot be discounted.\n\nThe USA, meanwhile, will hope that they can generate some sorely needed excitement on home soil after losing their way since a creditable run to the last 16 at the 2022 World Cup.

Ironically, the USMNT has no starters from Major League Soccer, but Argentina, the reigning Copa America champions, and several other nations have key players that compete weekly in the United States and Canada.\n\nIn fact, two of the biggest and most decorated players in the tournament are from the same MLS club. Check out the five Major League Soccer stars that will play a vital role for their countries at Copa America 2024.\n\nLionel Messi is the player to watch at Copa America 2024, MLS or not. The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner will once again captain Argentina as La Albiceleste try to win their record-breaking 16th Copa America title this summer.\n\nAfter a brief stint at PSG, Messi transferred to Inter Miami back in 2023 and has made headlines throughout the United States ever since. The 2022 World Cup champion helped the Herons claim their first major trophy, the 2023 Leagues Cup, and already has 25 goals in just 29 appearances.\n\nIn a group with Peru, Canada, and Chile, Argentina are the favorites to finish in first place. Fans can expect Messi to be at the heart of the action, just like he has been for the last two decades.\n\nThere was some uncertainly surrounding Luis Su\u00e1rez's Copa America call-up to Uruguay this summer. Despite Su\u00e1rez being Uruguay's all-time leading goalscorer, Liverpool's Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez had taken over the No. 9 position and kit. Su\u00e1rez's experience and raw goalscoring ability, though, could not be ignored.\n\nThe striker signed with Inter Miami just six months after Messi, reuniting the two former Barcelona teammates in the MLS. Su\u00e1rez has found the back of the net 14 times for the Herons so far in his 20 appearances, and is a huge reason why David Beckham's club sits atop the Eastern Conference.\n\nAt age 37, Su\u00e1rez will likely play his last Copa America for his country. La Celeste have what it takes to finish atop Group C and make a deep run in the competition with players like Su\u00e1rez, N\u00fa\u00f1ez (who gave the Inter Miami man the No. 9 back), and Fede Valverde.\n\nCarlos Gruezo is an instrumental piece for La Tri this summer. The San Jose Earthquakes man brings a defensive presence to Ecuador's midfield, and can also use his great technique to link up with the players up top, like John Yeboah.\n\nDrawn into a relatively easy Group B with Mexico, Jamaica, and Venezuela, Ecuador have a great opportunity to advance to the quarter-finals. As he approaches 60 international caps, Gruezo's experience makes him a reliable, efficient player who shines with or without the ball at his feet.\n\nThe San Jose Earthquakes might currently be last in the Western Conference, but their midfielder will show the quality the club has on their roster.\n\nCanada have the most MLS representation in the entire tournament with 14 Major League Soccer players earning a spot in Jesse Marsch's final squad. Alphonso Davies might get all the attention on Canada's backline, but Colorado Rapids' Mo\u00efse Bombito is another key defender for the first-time Copa America participants.\n\nEver since Marsch's hire, Bombito has become the starting center-back for his country, a position he will retain at Copa America 2024. Canada have an uphill battle in Group A, though, featuring Argentina, Peru, and Chile.\n\nBombito will need to defend against some of the best players in the world, including Lionel Messi. Fortunately, the Colorado Rapids played Inter Miami in April, and Bombito helped his side achieve a hard-fought 2-2 draw. The 24-year-old has started 15 of 16 MLS games so far this season, and even has two goals to his name.\n\nPedro Gallese just made his 106th international cap for Peru, a number that will keep increasing this summer as the Orlando City keeper takes his starting spot between the posts. Although his domestic team is having a tough season, Gallese could make a statement at the Copa America for his country.\n\nThe 34-year-old kept two clean sheets against Paraguay and El Salvador in Peru's two latest international friendlies. In fact, he has only conceded one goal in his three appearances this year for La Blanquirroja.\n\nPeru's odds to advance beyond Group A are not very high, but a supreme performance from their keeper could give them an upset or two.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer",

It's very difficult to imagine what can happen because it's still two years away. I don't need to commit right now to whether or not I'll be there,\" he added.\n\nWhat is certain is that Messi, who has managed his workload to try to be in peak condition for the tournament, would relish the chance to win a third straight major tournament with his country after so many years of frustration with his national team.\n\nAfter facing Canada, Argentina take on Chile in New Jersey before finishing their group A action against Peru in Miami but they know that tough opposition awaits in the knock-out stage with rivals Brazil and Uruguay the two expected challengers for the title.\n\nBrazil have struggled in CONMEBOL qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup having won just two of their opening six games and they currently sit in sixth place in the standings having lost to Uruguay, Colombia and Argentina.\n\nThere are several familiar names missing from Dorival Junior's Brazil squad with Casemiro, Gabriel Jesus and Thiago Silva left out while Richarlison and Neymar are both missing due to injury.\n\nThe pressure will be on the Real Madrid attacking pair of Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo to translate their club form into success for the Selecao while there is much excitement around the senior tournament debut of 17-year-old talent Endrick, who is set to join Real next month from Palmeiras.\n\nUruguay, also 15-times winners, have impressed under their 68-year-old Argentina coach Marcelo Bielsa, who has brought his trademark high-energy style to the team and raised expectations with recent wins over Argentina and Brazil.\n\nLiverpool forward Darwin Nunez will lead the line although Bielsa has the option of introducing veteran Luis Suarez from the bench.\n\nColombia head into the tournament without a loss in over two years and with Liverpool's livewire winger Luis Diaz a constant threat and James Rodriguez enjoying a late career revival, Nestor Lorenzo's team can't be discounted.\n\nThe USA will hope that they can generate some sorely needed excitement after losing their way since a creditable run to the last-16 at the World Cup.\n\nCoach Gregg Berhalter is under some pressure to show he can get his team, which relies on the smart wing play of Christian Pulisic, to compete with teams from outside of CONCACAF.\n\nMexico have guested frequently in the Copa in the past and reached the final in 1993 and 2001, but they look well below their usual level although they can, as always, count on huge support in the USA.\n\nThis is the second time the Copa America is being held in the USA, after the Centenary tournament in 2016, and while that is a break with tradition the presence of significant immigrant communities from all the competing nations, should ensure big crowds at the mostly NFL stadiums being used.", "source":

The tournament, co-organized by CONCACAF, will return to the United States for the first time since 2016. It'll feature six guest teams from Central and North America: Canada, Costa Rica, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama and the U.S.\n\nThe reigning Copa America and World Cup champion, Argentina, will also feature in the tournament. Lionel Messi and Co. kick off the competition this evening against Canada at 7 p.m. CT from Atlanta, Georgia. Fox will carry the national broadcast in the United States.

Gambling problem? Call 1-800-Gambler. Argentina, United States odds to win the 2024 Copa America\n\nWas anybody ever truly doubting who the favorites were at this tournament? The No. 1 and No. 5 teams in the world (according to the FIFA World Rankings), Argentina and Brazil, have the shortest odds among the 16-team field.\n\nArgentina, the reigning continental and global champion, is +175 to defend its Copa America crown. La Albiceleste's roster is stacked with talent at every level, led by the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner. This will be Lionel Scaloni's third Copa America in charge of Argentina; his sides have finished no worse than third.\n\nOf course, Brazil isn't too far behind its noisy neighbors on the board with +220 odds to lift the trophy. Sele\u00e7\u00e3o will be looking to reclaim the title after a runner-up finish in 2021 and win the tournament for the 10th time in history.\n\nThe only other side with shorter than 10/1 odds is the joint-most successful country in the competition, Uruguay (+550). La Celeste has gone 13 years without triumph in the tournament, which has allowed Argentina to catch them on 15 wins. Marcelo Bielsa will look to pass his former employers with a victory as the new Uruguayan manager.\n\nOther notable odds include Colombia, Mexico and the United States at 12/1, 13/1 and 14/1 respectively. The latter -- who is hosting the tournament -- has been the most successful team from CONCACAF in recent years.\n\nNevertheless, a 5-1 thrashing at the hands of Colombia in a recent friendly has some questioning whether or not Gregg Berhalter's team should be given a serious chance. Oddsmakers have shown their apprehension with the posted line. The Stars and Stripes have never finished higher than fourth in their four previous Copa America appearances.\n\nBolivia (+22000), Chile (+3700), Paraguay (+7000) and Peru (+5500) are the only other nations to lift the Copa America in its 108-year history.\n\nLet's check out the odds to win the 2024 Copa America courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook as of Wednesday, June 19, 2024:\n\n2024 Copa America

Coach Lionel Scaloni has largely maintained his World Cup-winning squad, with veterans Angel Di Maria and Nicolas Otamendi likely making their final appearances in a major tournament.\n\nIt remains uncertain whether this marks Messi's farewell to elite international football. The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner, now playing in Major League Soccer with Inter Miami, will celebrate his 37th birthday four days after Thursday's opener against Canada in Atlanta. He has yet to decide if he will attempt to play in a record sixth World Cup.\n\n\"It's great to have records and continue to achieve things but I won't take part in a World Cup just to say I've done six,\" Messi told ESPN last week.\n\n\"If I feel good and everything is in place for me to be there, fine, but I won't go just to go. It's very difficult to imagine what can happen because it's still two years away. I don't need to commit right now to whether or not I'll be there,\" he added.\n\nLionel Messi, who has carefully managed his workload to reach peak form for the tournament, would undoubtedly cherish the opportunity to secure a third consecutive major title with Argentina after years of disappointment with his national team.\n\nFollowing their match against Canada, Argentina will face Chile in New Jersey and conclude their group A campaign against Peru in Miami. However, they are well aware of the formidable opposition that awaits them in the knockout stage, with rivals Brazil and Uruguay expected to be the main contenders for the title.\n\nBrazil has struggled in the CONMEBOL qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup, having only won two of their first six matches and currently sitting in sixth place in the standings after losses to Uruguay, Colombia, and Argentina.\n\nSeveral familiar names are absent from Dorival Junior's Brazil squad, including Casemiro, Gabriel Jesus, and Thiago Silva, while Richarlison and Neymar are sidelined due to injury.\n\nThe pressure will be on the Real Madrid attacking duo of Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo to replicate their club form for the Selecao, and there is much anticipation surrounding the senior tournament debut of 17-year-old prodigy Endrick, who is set to join Real next month from Palmeiras.\n\nUruguay, also 15-time winners, has impressed under their 68-year-old Argentine coach Marcelo Bielsa, who has implemented his signature high-energy style and raised expectations with recent victories over Argentina and Brazil. Liverpool forward Darwin Nunez will spearhead the attack, although Bielsa has the option of bringing on veteran Luis Suarez from the bench.\n\nColombia enters the tournament undefeated in over two years, with Liverpool's dynamic winger Luis Diaz posing a constant threat and James Rodriguez experiencing a late-career resurgence. Coach Nestor Lorenzo's team cannot be overlooked.\n\nThe USA hopes to generate much-needed excitement after losing their way since a respectable run to the last-16 at the World Cup. Coach Gregg Berhalter is under pressure to demonstrate that his team, which relies on Christian Pulisic's intelligent wing play, can compete with teams from outside of CONCACAF.\n\nMexico has frequently participated in the Copa as a guest and reached the final in 1993 and 2001, but they appear to be well below their usual standard, although they can, as always, rely on massive support in the USA.\n\nThis marks the second time the Copa America is being held in the USA, following the Centenary tournament in 2016. While this deviates from tradition, the presence of significant immigrant communities from all the participating nations should ensure large crowds at the primarily NFL stadiums being utilized.\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

CONCACAF is a co-organizer of the tournament, which is scheduled to take place in the USA.\n\nThe United States will host the competition for the second time, having hosted the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario in 2016; will kick off from tomorrow.\n\nIn celebration of the lead-up to the United States' hosting of the 2026 World Cup, the competition will unite North and South America for a unique CONMEBOL continental championship.\n\nIn addition to six North American competitors competing against the established CONMEBOL powers for the title of continental champion, ten of the traditional South American nations will be in the competition.\n\nAhead of this, let us have a look at the highest paid head coaches of the Copa America.\n\nMarcelo Bielsa of Uruguay tops the list of the highest paid managers in Copa America right now with $4 million of yearly income.\n\nUnder Bielsa, Uruguay's roster has been given a whole new lease on life as younger players have been brought in to replace the more seasoned players who have proven to be so vital in previous years. It is to be seen how it works here in the tournament.\n\nDorival Junior is tied with the Brazilian manager who also makes around $4 million early.\n\nThe manager has announced a strong squad including the attacking combinations of Vinicius Jr., Rodrygo, Gabriel Martinelli, and Raphinha; in the midfield, Bruno Guimaraes, Lucas Paqueta, and Douglas Luiz; and on defense, Marquinhos, Eder Militao, and Gabriel.\n\nRicardo Gareca is currently third in the list with 3.7 million income. The 66-year-old is currently leading the Chile football national team.\n\nWith Argentina, Canada, and Peru in their group, just qualifying for the knockout stages might be a positive step for Chile as the national football team transitions to a new era.\n\nWorld Cup winner Lionel Scaloni is fourth in the list with $2.6 million.

The tournament could mark the 36-year-old Messi's final act with the national team. It could also give the number 10 a final push towards the 2026 World Cup. The early rounds of South American World Cup qualifiers suggest Messi's international run could be extended, as Argentina tops the qualifying after six matches. But a good performance at Copa America could prove decisive for his future. Midfielder Mac Allister will have a good opportunity to show he has developed further as a player if he can keep Argentina moving when Messi's energy goes down during games. Striker Martinez will have another chance to show a good club season for him in Europe can translate into great form with the national team.\n\nKey players: Pedro Gallese, Luis Adv\u00edncula, Gianluca Lapadula\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Fossati became Peru coach in December with the team at the bottom of the 10-team round robin South American World Cup qualifying. A goalless draw with Paraguay at home on June 7, amid Copa America preparations, suggests not much has improved since. Nothing seems to work on a team that is still tied to veteran players, like goalkeeper Gallese, defender Advincula and striker Lapadula. And newcomers don't seem ready to challenge. Fossati will not start the tournament under pressure, but a first-round elimination in a tough group could make his life in the Peru job difficult very soon.\n\nKey players: Claudio Bravo, Alexis S\u00e1nchez, Ben Brereton\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Chile has struggled to leave its golden generation behind, and its Copa America squad shows it. Goalkeeper Bravo (41) and striker Sanchez (35) are sure to be among the key players on a team that has struggled to compete against fitter rivals in recent years. Defender Gary Medel (36) and midfielder Arturo Vidal (37) didn't make the cut but were not far from being included. Gareca, who took Peru to the World Cup in 2018, has yet to find a starting lineup since he joined in January. A recent 3-0 win against Paraguay gave new hope to the team ahead of the tournament, but it is unlikely Chile will find such weak opposition at the start of the group stage.\n\nKey players: Alphonso Davies, Tajon Buchanan, Jonathan David\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Jesse Marsch took over as team manager in mid-May after spending a year at the helm of Leeds United. He has already managed a couple of warm-up matches for Copa America, a 4-0 loss to the Netherlands and 0-0 draw against France. After a disappointing World Cup in Qatar, where the team lost all three of its matches, Canada Soccer is hoping Marsch can do better against tough competition in Copa America, including facing off against reigning world champion Argentina.\n\nKey players: Santiago Gim\u00e9nez, Juli\u00e1n Qui\u00f1ones, Edson \u00c1lvarez.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Jaime Lozano made a surprising move before Copa America by leaving off veterans Guillermo Ochoa, Raul Jim\u00e9nez, Hirving Lozano and Jesus Gallardo, as well as Henry Martin, because he is trying to give new players a chance to prove they can compete for a spot in the 2026 World Cup. So far, the experiment is not going well. Mexico lost 4-0 against Uruguay and 3-2 against Brazil in friendlies ahead of the tournament, leaving many pundits wondering if the move to go younger at this moment was right. As the friendly games have shown, Mexico is weak on defense. Besides Ochoa's absence, the team has lost projected starting goalkeeper Luis Malag\u00f3n to an injury. Carlos Acevedo, who was called to replace Malag\u00f3n, has looked impressive in practice since his arrival and could be a surprising starter.\n\nKey players: Piero Hincapi\u00e9, Enner Valencia, Moises Caicedo\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Ecuador remains one of the most competitive national teams in South America, much of it due to a generation of players that has been developed at local clubs Independiente del Valle and Liga de Quito. It is in fifth position in the regional World Cup qualifying despite starting with -3 points due to a penalty. But it has yet to show it can play well. Striker Valencia is struggling to score for the national team, and midfielder Caicedo has yet to show the pace he had prior to his move to Chelsea. The team's defense is set to be a strength, led by defender Hincapi\u00e9, who had a great season with German champions Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nKey players: Jeferson Soteldo, Yangel Herrera, Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Venezuela seems set to qualify for the World Cup for the first time, and its strengths are likely to show during Copa America. The team's top form, which includes an away draw at Brazil in World Cup qualifying, was built by coach Jos\u00e9 Pekerman, who left the job in March last year without providing any explanation. When many feared Venezuela would once again tank, Batista managed to keep the team's up front power and improve its transitions. Midfielder Soteldo is recovering from a right thigh injury, and his health could be decisive for the team's future in the tournament.\n\nKey players: Bobby Decordova-Reid, Shamar Nicholson and Cory Burke.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: The Reggae Boyz will appear in the South American tournament for the third time looking to break a six-game losing streak. Its first opponent, Mexico, could be the most difficult one, despite the absence of some key players. Jamaica will miss Aston Villa's Leon Bailey despite being included in the 26-man roster. Bailey's agent Craig Butler said that Bailey decided to take a break from the team. Coach Heimir Hallgr\u00edmsson has been with the team since 2022 and had good moments in the League of Nations, including a win over Canada that secured their spot in Copa America.\n\nKey players: Federico Valverde, Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Luis Su\u00e1rez\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Bielsa has begun a rebuilding process in Uruguay, but he can't give up on veteran players as he assembles his squad for the tournament. Striker N\u00fa\u00f1ez had a reasonable season at Liverpool, in which he scored 18 goals in 54 matches. He is expected to step up as 37-year-old Edinson Cavani retired from the national team. N\u00fa\u00f1ez will have to count on veteran Su\u00e1rez, playing his fifth Copa America, to help him up front. Uruguay beat Mexico 4-0 in a friendly early in June to suggest that any rival that does not respect its strikers will suffer. Midfielder Valverde will be the team's leader in the U.S.\n\nKey players: Christian Pulisic, John Sargent, Folarin Balogun\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: The U.S. has already proven to be the top team in CONCACAF after beating Mexico in the League of Nations final for the second year in a row. Copa America gives the Americans an opportunity to show they can give the South Americans trouble. The team lost 5-1 to Colombia, a nation that is riding a 22-game unbeaten streak, but then played a good match against Brazil, one of the top two contenders alongside Argentina. The U.S. team looks to be the favorite to move on to the second round with Uruguay, although Panama will be tough to beat. The problem for the Americans should they finish second behind Uruguay is there's a good chance they would meet Brazil in the quarterfinals.\n\nKey players: Michael Murillo, Adalberto Carrasquilla, Luis Mej\u00eda\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Under Thomas Christensen, the Panamanians have shown consistent progress even though they missed the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Christiansen remains at the helm despite that and last year the team was the runner-up in the Gold Cup and this year they made their way to the Nations League semifinals. Led by the Houston Dynamo's Adalberto Carrasquilla, the player of the tournament in last year's Gold Cup, Panama will try to upset the group favorites Uruguay and the United States. The team arrives at the tournament after securing a couple of victories in the CONCACAF qualifiers against Guyana and Montserrat. The 'Canaleros' will have a final warmup against Paraguay before facing Uruguay.\n\nKey players: Carlos Lampe, Gabriel Villamil, C\u00e9sar Menacho\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Bolivia has had a slow start under coach Zago, as its penultimate place in South American World Cup qualifying shows, but the team continues to field young players while looking to the future. Bolivia's hopes in Copa America lie in players who are more like 24-year-old striker Menacho, one of the top goal scorers of his country's national championship. A few veterans remain, including goalkeeper Lampe. The team will miss striker Marcelo Martins, who retired in March at age 36. Unlike most of its competitors, Bolivia's squad mostly includes local players.\n\nKey players: Vinicius J\u00fanior, Endrick and Lucas Paquet\u00e1\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: New coach, new starters and no Neymar. Brazil is likely to be competitive at Copa America as the team's performances in friendlies this year suggest, but it is hard to see J\u00fanior's team as heavy favorites. There are a few evident starters in goalkeeper Alisson, defender \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o, midfielder Paquet\u00e1 and winger J\u00fanior but that is about it. Teenager Endrick has delivered goals since he was first called up to the senior team in March, but Brazil's coach has not yet decided whether he or Rodrygo will start. Brazil's bench is filled with players getting their first opportunity with the national team.\n\nKey players: Jefferson Lerma, James Rodr\u00edguez, Luis D\u00edaz\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Unbeaten for 18 matches, Colombia is one of the favorites to win Copa America, something the team has not done in 23 years. Before beating the United States 5-1 amid preparations for the tournament, Colombia beat Brazil 2-1 in South American World Cup qualifying and topped both Spain and Germany in friendlies in Europe. Midfielder Rodr\u00edguez, who has struggled to play for his clubs in recent years, has delivered good performances for the national team. Colombia is in third place in World Cup qualifying, and a convincing campaign at Copa America could make its physical and skillful team aim higher in the next few years.\n\nKey players: Diego G\u00f3mez, Gustavo G\u00f3mez, Miguel Almir\u00f3n\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Paraguay will use Copa America and the Paris Olympics to try to secure a spot at the 2026 World Cup. Garnero is trying to rejuvenate his squad with the support of two key veterans: defender G\u00f3mez, one of the best on the continent since he arrived in Brazil's Palmeiras, and veteran striker Almir\u00f3n. The performances of 21-year-old midfielder G\u00f3mez of Inter Miami will be key for the Paraguayans to have any hopes of getting through the group. The tournament will also help the coach adjust his team to recover in World Cup qualifying, which currently sees Paraguay in 7th, out of the qualification zone.\n\nKey players: Francisco Calvo, Joel Campbell and Manfred Ugalde\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: After leading Ecuador to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, Alfaro became the Ticos' coach last November, replacing Luis Fernando Su\u00e1rez. Under Alfaro, the team is making a transition and several key players from the past are gone, including iconic goalkeeper Keylor Navas and veterans Celso Borges and Bryan Ruiz, leaving Joel Campbell and Francisco Calvo as the only veterans on the squad. Costa Rica has won its two World Cup qualifiers against Grenada and Saint Kitts and Nevis and had a 0-0 draw against Uruguay on May 31. Alfaro and his players know sharing the group with Brazil and Colombia, two of the contenders in the tournament, will not be an easy task, especially with a young team facing its first major test.",

However, in November 2022, the country surprisingly declined to host the tournament and Peru and the United States had both expressed interest in organising the tournament. Ultimately, the United States was chosen as the host.\n\nThis is not the only controversy of the world's oldest football tournament involving national teams, the history of South American continental showpiece event has been smeared with controversial incidents.\n\nALSO READ | Copa America 2024: Suarez, Nunez part of Uruguay's 26-man squad\n\nHere's a list of top controversies from the history of Copa America:\n\nQatar playing as guest nation\n\nCopa America is known for including several inviting nations outside CONMEBOL to participate in the tournament, however, the selection of those countries have drawn huge criticisms at times. Ahead of the 2019 edition which was held in Brazil, CONMEBOL announced that three nations each from CONCACAF and AFC. From the Asian continent Qatar and Japan joined the tournament which didn't went without notice. Eventually the oil-rich gulf kingdom which was set to organise the 2022 FIFA World Cup existed from the group stage.\n\nMessi's controversial red card\n\nIn the third place match between Argentina and Chile in Copa America 2019, Lionel Messi was sent-off before half-time. With Argentina up 2-0, Messi and Chile's Gary Medel got into a heated shoving match, with Messi using only his chest, and both got red cards. Medel looked to try and sneak a headbutt in, and it was a wild, tense moment that felt certain to end in a fight: It remained one of the weirdest moments in Messi's storied career.\n\nLatest on

The 2024 Copa America starts Thursday as defending champions Argentina raise the curtain on the CONMEBOL championship with a group match in Atlanta against guest participants Canada.\n\nAfter playing most of his international career as the best player never to win a major trophy, Lionel Messi will look to win his third straight after securing titles in the 2020 Copa America and the 2022 World Cup.\n\nThe Albiceleste have what appears to be a cakewalk to the 2024 final, as all the most in-form teams in the competition, like Brazil, Uruguay, Colombia and the United States, are on the opposite side of the bracket. Meanwhile, the best their side has to offer appears to be Ecuador, Venezuela and a down Mexico.\n\nCanada are under new management as American boss Jesse Marsch, who was hired only around a month ago, will make his competitive debut with Les Rouges. It's unclear how heavily he will look to implement his Red Bull-bred high-pressing scheme that would be massively risky against top-tier opponents such as this.\n\nArgentina won't face a Copa America title contender until the final, and failing to reach that stage would be an enormous disappointment. In truth, they should win every game comfortably up to that point, although winning \"comfortably\" for Argentina can sometimes end up as 1-0 or 2-0 victories.\n\nCanada will give them a fight as they have many opponents in recent years, but in the end, the fledgling CONCACAF contenders make far too many individual errors to have a chance at an early upset. It's rare that 1/3 odds present \"value\" but for Argentina here, it probably should be more like 1/4 or 1/5.\n\n* Indicates following day\n\nCanada have lots of attacking talent, but they struggle to retain the ball and spring counter-attacks. Les Rouges failed to score a single goal in their two Copa America warmup friendlies against the Netherlands and France, and while, sure, that's top-tier competition, look at who they're playing here.\n\nAlphonso Davies and Jonathan David were enormously isolated in the buildup against their recent European opponents -- those two combined for 12 touches in the opposition box over the course of both friendlies, and Davies completed a combined 75 passes despite touching the ball 182 times.\n\nArgentina are masters at securing a lead and smothering opponents into submission, and Canada can be easily smothered. If the CONCACAF underdogs fail to snatch an early goal like Guatemala did in their recent friendly against Argentina, this game will get bogged down in midfield and leave Canada with no way of finding the net.\n\nArgentina do not run up the score on opponents with regularity unless forced to do so, like in their memorable 2022 World Cup final against France. In fact, the Albiceleste have won a game to nil by more than three goals just four times since the end of the 2018 World Cup, and all were in friendlies.\n\nThe last time Argentina won a game to nil by 4+ goals in a competitive match was a 4-0 Copa America semifinal victory over the United States way back in the summer of 2016. In the eight years since, they've won just eight competitive matches by at least three-goal margin overall, with seven of those by a 3-0 score.\n\nCanada were torn to shreds by the Netherlands, who are a high-energy team, but Les Rouges managed to keep a lid on their friendly in a scoreless draw against France, who play much more similarly to Argentina.\n\nThe English-language broadcast rights to the 2024 Copa America domestically in the United States are owned by Fox Sports, which will place most games on FS1 because conflicts with Euro 2024, which Fox is also televising. FS1 is available to stream on Fubo, which is offering a free trial for new users.\n\nA Spanish-language broadcast can also be found on TUDN and Univision, both of which are also available to stream on Fubo.\n\nIn Canada, this match can be found televised on CTV Two as well as TSN1 and TSN4, who both stream the game on their dedicated platforms as well. A French-language broadcast can be accessed on RDS 2.\n\nIn the UK, the entirety of the Copa America will be televised on Premier Sports 1, with streaming on their platform Premier Sports player.",

Can the Canadians find a way to salvage a point and kick-start their Copa America journey? Our soccer expert Chris Vasile breaks down Canada's Copa America chances.\n\nAfter making just their second World Cup appearance in 2022, Canada will make their Copa America debut this summer but I wouldn't get too excited about their chances.\n\nCanada's Copa America 2024 odds have them as outsiders to get through the group stage and into the knockout round.\n\nCan global superstar Alphonso Davies find a way to help Canada defy the Copa America 2024 odds?\n\nWhen Canada takes the pitch for their first game against Argentina at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Jesse Marsch will likely line them up in a 4-42 formation.\n\nThe back four should consist of Moises Bombito Kamal Miller, both of whom ply their trades in the MLS, Alistair Johnston who had a tremendous season for Scottish champions, Celtic, and Alphonso Davies.\n\nThe midfield will be comprised of Tajon Buchanan, Stephen Eustaquio, Ismael Kone, and Liam Millar. This group will be the engine room for Canada and if they can't win battles in the midfield and control the game, Canada will be in for a world of hurt.\n\nIn attack, Jonathan David (Lille) who finished second in Ligue 1 scoring behind Kylian Mbappe will lead the line, with Cyle Larin (Mallorca) partnering up front.\n\nIke Ugbo will be the go-to attacking option off the bench if things are going awry.\n\nCanada has the unenviable task of taking on the holders Argentina in their first match to kick off the tournament. While Argentina is the clear-cut favorite, and boasts a stingy defense, attacking them may be the only chance Canada has at getting a point.\n\nA nil-nil is unlikely given the firepower Argentina boasts, so a single goal here would go a long way in helping this bet. However, if that doesn't come to fruition, fear not. Peru's defense is less than stellar, giving up eight goals in six CONEMBOL World Cup qualifying matches.\n\nDespite being underdogs, the Canadians will enter this game knowing three points is a must, and with high-level players in their XI, they should bag at least two.\n\nIn the finale against Chile, another team conceding a goal per game in WCQs, Canada will do well to find the back of the net if they want any chance of advancing.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonso_Davies", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphonso Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alistair_Johnston", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alistair Johnston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajon_Buchanan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tajon Buchanan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamal_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamal Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Millar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liam Millar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_David", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan David"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Marsch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Marsch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lille_OSC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lille OSC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ik\u00e9_Ugbo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ik\u00e9 Ugbo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyle_Larin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyle Larin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCD_Mallorca", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RCD Mallorca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligue_1", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ligue 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Petanque", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Petanque", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/e7a9d536-6d9a-42ca-a02b-60e76e92a7dd.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658543", "eventUri": "eng-9658543", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

The first matchday will be completed a day later when Chile and Peru meet in Arlington, Texas.\n\nGroup A's second matchday is scheduled for Tuesday, June 25, with Argentina taking on Chile in East Rutherford (New York) and Peru facing Canada in Kansas City (Kansas State).\n\nThe third and final matchday of Group A will be played on Saturday, June 29, with Argentina battling Peru in Miami and Canada challenging Chile in Orlando.\n\nAll the group's teams will be mixing squads stuffed with new stars and veterans enjoying one last run. Chile and Peru, who were both absent from Qatar 2022 after failing to qualify, will be looking to a new generation to spark the fire with the World Cup in 2026 - which will be hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada - already beginning to loom on the horizon.\n\n1. Argentina: Messi and Di Mar\u00eda's farewell\n\nUSA 2024 will be the last Copa Am\u00e9rica for one of the greatest players of all time. Seventh on the list of tournament appearances. Lionel Messi will turn 37 on Monday, June 24. The Inter Miami star's presence at the 2026 World Cup is in the balance - this could be it for major tournaments.\n\nCoach Lionel Scaloni has given clues in the qualifiers as to how to deal with that issue in the near future and Messi's inevitable absence in the future, which will also be compounded by the loss of \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, who at 36 years of age will retire from international football after the Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\nA midfield triangle led by Alexis Mac Allister (age 25) with Giovani Lo Celso (28) and Nicol\u00e1s Gonz\u00e1lez (26), with Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez (24) as a false nine and Lautaro Mart\u00ednez (26) in the penalty area, seems to be the formula that the coach will use in the future, once the two mega stars have stepped aside.\n\nFor now, Messi is at full strength thanks to a good spell with Inter Miami and Di Maria is physically intact after finishing the season well with Benfica.\n\nFaces to watch? Nineteen-year-old Alejandro Garnacho, Manchester United's wayward and eccentric winger, and Valent\u00edn Carboni, another 19-year-old attacker from Inter Milan who had a great season on-loan with Italy's Monza. The latter earned praise from Messi for his outstanding work in last Friday's friendly against Guatemala.\n\nThe rest of the squad is the foundation of the 2022 World Cup-winning side: experienced, gritty and resolute.\n\nChile won the Copa Am\u00e9rica as hosts in 2015, and a year later, at the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario edition in the United States, they lifted the trophy again.\n\nArgentina knows how painful it is to lose to their arch-rivals - they lost both of those finals on penalties, defeats that allowed 'La Roja' to claim their only two titles as a senior team.\n\nBoth conquests were achieved at the hand of the so-called 'Golden Generation,' many of whom today resist passing the baton to the next national team stars. Alexis S\u00e1nchez (aged 35), goalkeeper Claudio Bravo (41), full-back Mauricio Isla (35) and striker Eduardo Vargas (34) will perhaps make their last appearances in this tournament before retiring.\n\nArgentine coach Ricardo Gareca has a number of younger stars who will hoping to make an impact: Striker Victor D\u00e1vila, 26, just completed his first season at CSKA Moscow; 20-year-old right winger Dar\u00edo Osorio (Danish Midtjylland); and midfielder Marcelino N\u00fa\u00f1ez, 24, a fierce forward who completed a second season at English Championship side Norwich City.\n\nBottom with two points from six matches in the South American qualifying for the next World Cup in 2026, Peru are in their poorest moment for some time. After qualifying for the Russia 2018 World Cup, their first since Spain in 1982, everything has gone downhill.\n\nUruguayan Jorge Fossati, 71, took over the reins of 'La Blanquirroja' in 2024 with the challenge of pulling them out of their deep depression, but the players he can turn to are still the ones used by his predecessor Juan Reynost.\n\nThat's why the tireless 40-year-old striker Paolo Guerrero, the team's top scorer with 40 goals, continues to play. Gianluca Lapadula (age 34), goalkeeper Pedro Gallese (34), defenders Carlos Zambrano (34) and Luis Adv\u00edncula (33) and midfielder Christian Cueva (32), among others, have also been called up.\n\nThere are still young faces to watch: right-winger Joao Grimaldo, 21, a daring forward for Sporting Cristal, defender Oliver Sonne, 23, born in Denmark to a Peruvian mother and a right-back for Danish side Silkeborg IF, and midfielder Piero Quispe, 22, of Mexico's Pumas.\n\nMaking their Copa Am\u00e9rica debut, Canada entered the USA 2024 edition through the back door by beating Trinidad and Tobago 2-0 in a single match in a CONCACAF play-off.\n\nThe Canucks participated in the Qatar 2022 World Cup, losing to Belgium (1-0), Croatia (4-1) and Morocco (2-1) in the first round. Three setbacks - just like in their World Cup debut in Mexico 1986.\n\nUS coach Jesse Marsch, 50, has been Canada's gaffer since mid-May and the team's flag-bearer is versatile left-back Alphonso Davies (23), a Bayern Munich star and one of Real Madrid's transfer targets.\n\nFaces to watch: Strikers Jonathan David (24) of Lille, Tajon Buchanan (25) of Inter Milan, Jacob Shaffelburg (24) of MLS side Nashville and Cyle Larin (29) of Mallorca.\n\nArgentina's record-breaking skipper Lionel Messi could add even more plaudits at the tournament in the United States.", "source": {"uri":

Neymar will be absent for 2021 runners-up Brazil, though Vinicius Jr. will hope to have a breakout international tournament as he continues to flourish for Real Madrid.\n\nFor the U.S. men's national team, Christian Pulisic and Co. will seek a deep run to prove they belong against some of the top nations, while Mexico desperately needs to find some form.\n\nFrom how to watch to teams and players to watch for, here's everything to know for the Copa America 2024:\n\nThe Copa America tournament is similar to the World Cup except it only involves teams in North and South America and the Caribbean. Teams compete in four-nation groups and play each other round-robin style.\n\nThe top two sides from each group will advance to the knockout stages. From there, each game is single elimination until a winner is crowned in the final.\n\nThe 2024 tournament will begin on Thursday, June 20 and run until the final on Sunday, July 14.\n\nArgentina vs. Canada on Thursday at 8 p.m. ET, 5 p.m. PT is the tournament opener.\n\nThe United States is the host country for the entire tournament. The final will be held in Miami, Fla.\n\nThe 2024 tournament will be available to watch and stream in English on FOX Sports (FOX, FS1, FS2) while Univision and TUDN will broadcast and stream games in Spanish.\n\nThere's not a specific \"Group of Death\" in the 2024 Copa America due to the overall quality, but Group D may be the most intriguing. Here's a look at all four groups:\n\nArgentina and Brazil should be the clear-cut favorites to win the tournament based on roster strength.\n\nLed by Messi, Argentina's squad is essentially similar to the team that won the 2022 World Cup. Lionel Scaloni is still the manager, with Julian Alvarez, Exequiel Palacio and Christian Romero establishing themselves more at the club level since the Qatar triumph.\n\nBrazil, now managed by Dorival Junior, also brought a squad quite similar to the Qatar World Cup. Some key names not involved are Neymar, Gabriel Jesus, Casemiro and Richarlison, while Endrick, Gabriel Martinelli, Savio and Ederson are potential breakout candidates.\n\nIf it's not Argentina or Brazil, then Uruguay and Colombia could be the primary underdogs.\n\nUruguay doesn't have a standout goalie, but Federico Valverde, Luis Suarez, Darwin Nunez, Ronald Araujo, Jose Maria Gimenez, Manuel Ugarte and Rodrigo Bentancur are more than enough to potentially topple the few bigger teams.\n\nColombia has veteran David Ospina between the sticks, but Luis Diaz, Jhon Duran, Daniel Munoz, Jefferson Lerma, Luis Sinisterra and Davinson Sanchez could play spoiler if it all pans out.\n\nFringe underdog teams include the USMNT, Mexico and Ecuador, but each have its flaws.\n\nThe U.S. under Gregg Berhalter has struggled to upset bigger teams, Mexico is still in a turbulent phase and Ecuador has a promising defensive structure but it lacks game changers in attack.", "source": {"uri":

It marks the second time the United States has hosted the tournament with an expanded 16-team field.\n\nArgentina is the favorite to win this edition of the tournament after winning it in 2021 and following up with a World Cup win the following year. In 2016, Argentina made it to the Final of the Copa America Centenario but lost to Chile in penalties.\n\nFor the 2024 Copa America, Argentina has +175 odds on BetMGM, followed by Brazil (+225) and Uruguay (+500). The host Americans share the same +1200 odds as Colombia and neighboring Mexico.\n\nLionel Messi is unsurprisingly the favorite to be top scorer of the tournament (+300), followed by Brazil's Vinicius Junior (+450) and Uruguay's Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez (+600).\n\nThe host Americans are expected to get out of Group C, which includes Uruguay, Bolivia and Panama. The U.S. men's national team is -1000 to advance and is being given a decent shot at winning the group (+130), although Uruguay is the favorite.\n\nFor more on the Copa America, Martino Puccio and Dan Santaromita made predictions ahead of the tournament.\n\nLet's start with the U.S. What are you expecting from the Americans at this tournament?\n\nMartino: I am expecting and hoping for a second-place finish in this group. Uruguay is superior when it comes to overall talent. They defeated Argentina 2-0 in the qualifiers, whereas the USMNT has shown an inability to beat top-tier nations. Panama is a familiar opponent that shouldn't pose a great threat, not to mention how much weaker Bolivia is. Anything other than advancing from the group is a failure. From there, the U.S. is most likely to play Brazil, and advancing out of that matchup would be a massive success.\n\nDan: Take nothing for granted with the U.S. men, but they should easily be able to get out of the group. Bolivia and Panama on home soil should be victories. Uruguay in the final group match is another story, but wins in the first two would make that match only relevant for winning the group. If the U.S. fails to get out of this group, the social media meltdown would be worth grabbing your popcorn for.\n\nBeyond that, I expect the U.S. to lose in a quarterfinal. The likely opponents are Colombia or Brazil, the two nations the U.S. just faced in friendlies. I don't see the U.S. getting past either, although it's not unthinkable.\n\nHow about the rest of the CONCACAF teams? Does Mexico have a run in it?\n\nMartino: I think Jesse Marsch and Canada have the ability to make a respectable run here in this tournament. Overall depth might be lacking for the Canadians, but they do have elite top-end talent relative to the rest of CONCACAF. Finishing second in their group isn't out of the question when it comes to finishing ahead of Chile and Peru. Those teams are respectable, but Canada has +190 odds to advance, which is worth the risk if you believe in Marsch and the group having a lot to prove.\n\nDan: Some big names didn't make the Mexico squad, which could be a good thing in the long run. Mexico needs some young players to step up, and getting minutes in this tournament will be beneficial.\n\nHowever, this team doesn't have the talent and quality of Mexico teams we've been accustomed to. The good news for El Tri is that the draw was kind. Group B includes Ecuador, Venezuela and Jamaica, so Mexico has a good chance to win the group and even make a semifinal if it can avoid a quarterfinal with Argentina.\n\nMexico can make a run if it beats teams it is capable of beating and avoids the powers in the tournaments, but I'd have a hard time ranking this team higher than sixth in the 16-team field.\n\nWho is your pick to win the tournament?\n\nMartino: Argentina. Picking them straight up isn't sexy or worth that much overall. I'd rather select Argentina to win in a matchup against another side. Any of the following are strong possibilities and have decent odds: Colombia +800, Brazil +225, Uruguay at +500. Colombia getting the same exact odds as the USMNT seems very disrespectful to Colombia. Every path that sees Brazil winning the group makes life a lot easier for Argentina to make the final.\n\nDan: Give me Argentina. It's boring, but if Argentina and Brazil are the top contenders, Argentina is playing better than Brazil right now. Brazil has three losses in six World Cup qualifiers (sixth in the 10-team CONMEBOL table) and was not impressive in its warm-up matches against Mexico and the U.S. They needed a 96th-minute goal to beat Mexico 3-2 and drew the Americans 1-1 a few days later.\n\nArgentina should be playing with nothing to lose after winning the last Copa America and World Cup.\n\nDoes anyone outside of Brazil and Argentina have a shot to win?\n\nMartino: Uruguay. I really do like this team heading into the tournament. Uruguay has a favorable group that it should win, which would help to avoid a potential matchup with Brazil. Uruguay beat Argentina in a World Cup qualifier and has the likes of Federico Valverde leading the charge. Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez has been inconsistent in front of goal, but for the most part, the talent in this competition is something he can feast on.\n\nDan: A year ago, I would have never believed I'd be saying this, but Colombia has something cooking. Los Cafeteros failed to qualify for the 2022 World Cup, and even though they finished third in the 2021 Copa America, they scored just four goals in six matches before the third-place match in that tournament.\n\nIncredibly, Colombia hasn't lost in 23 matches, a stretch that dates back over two years. Granted, missing the World Cup means there hasn't been a major tournament during that run and 17 of those matches were friendlies. Still, Colombia has recent wins against Germany, Brazil (in a 2026 World Cup qualifier), Mexico (twice), Spain and the United States (5-1 just over a week ago). Even in friendlies, that's a great resume.\n\nColombia is in what might be the toughest group (with Brazil, Paraguay and Costa Rica) but could make a run regardless.\n\nWhat other predictions do you have? Top scorer? Group upsets?\n\nMartino: I really like Santiago Gim\u00e9nez to be Mexico's top scorer with a price of +250. He has really come on strong in the last 18 months, and is riding a hot streak into this tournament. A player like that on a side that desperately needs him feels like a nice play.\n\nFor the USMNT, I do like Christian Pulisic to be the team's top scorer. That may sound obvious, but it is paying out at +400, which feels like an excellent price. This has been the best season of his club career and he is the team's penalty taker.\n\nTo round it out, Jonathan David as Canada's top scorer at +250. He's consistent, the team's best option and that's a good price for a capable player like him.\n\nDan: I think Canada has a shot to get out of its group. Argentina is justifiably a big -400 favorite to win Group A, but second place could be wide open between Canada, Chile and Peru. Peru is winless and in last place in the CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying table. Chile's only win in six qualifiers came against Peru.\n\nCanada still has top-line talent in Alphonso Davies and Jonathan David. Plus, the last warm-up match was a 0-0 draw at France, which should be a confidence boost.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

While Messi's move to Miami opened a fresh chapter, winning the Copa in North and South America in consecutive editions would complete his coronation as the King of America in football.\n\nA familiar challenge\n\nThe crown, like every other, will not be easy for Argentina and Messi, as arch-rival Brazil looks to regain hegemony under new coach Dorival Junior.\n\nTalented bunch: Led by Vinicius Junior (third from right) Brazil's assembly line of attack extends to its bench, with Endrick (21), Gabriel Martinelli and Savio. | Photo Credit: REUTERS\n\nTalented bunch: Led by Vinicius Junior (third from right) Brazil's assembly line of attack extends to its bench, with Endrick (21), Gabriel Martinelli and Savio. | Photo Credit: REUTERS\n\nThough it has had a rough ride in the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifiers, the surplus of young talent sets Brazil up for a new era of fluid, possession-based football, which saw Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Flamengo clinch silverware under Dorival.\n\nBrazil's best bet remains Vinicius Junior, who will lead the attack, having won the UEFA Champions League and La Liga title with Real Madrid this season.\n\nWhile he typically plays along the left wing, the absence of captain Neymar and striker Richarlison -- both out with injuries -- might see him play more centrally, with Rodrygo and Raphinha on the flanks.\n\nBrazil's assembly line of attack extends to its bench, with Endrick (17), Gabriel Martinelli (22), and Savio (20) -- who directly contributed to five of Brazil's eight goals in friendlies before the Copa.\n\nDorival's boldest move has been excluding Casemiro, who also served as skipper of the national team at the FIFA World Cup 2022.\n\nA perpetual pivot in the middle of the park, the Manchester United midfielder, struggling with form and consistency, was snubbed as younger options, Bruno Guimaraes and Douglas Luiz, rose in the pecking order.\n\nThe injury of Ederson before the tournament may not trouble Brazil's first-team plans -- with Alisson set to start between the sticks. But the former's absence as the most reliable backup can make the team vulnerable if the Liverpool goalie picks up an injury.\n\nDorival's young boys will have an opportunity to set the stage for the 2026 World Cup, part of which will also be played in the USA. And a change of guard in Copa could be the perfect prelude to Samba, two years later.\n\nBeyond the obvious\n\nThough Brazil and Argentina remain the clear favourites, Messi's former coach Marcelo Bielsa will enter the tournament as Uruguay's coach, banking on a balanced mix of youth and experience to pack a punch in the USA.\n\nWhile its highest-ever goalscorer Luis Su\u00e1rez will play his fifth Copa, the side's engine room will be powered by Manuel Ugarte, Rodrigo Bentancur, and Federico Valverde -- all of whom play their club football in Europe.\n\nWith Edinson Cavani retired, Darwin Nunez will look to step up, playing his first Copa America.\n\nThough the tournament has seen the domination of the Big Three -- Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay -- upsets have not been rare. Whether it was Argentina's loss to the USA in 1995 or Peru beating Brazil in 2016, the tournament has maintained football's appetite for unpredictability.\n\nThis is where Colombia comes in as the dark horse, riding on a 22-game unbeaten streak since its last loss against Argentina in February 2022.\n\nWith an in-form No. 9 in Rafael Borre, who has four goals in his last five games for club and country, and James Rodriguez pulling strings in the midfield, Colombia has won seven onsecutive matches going into the tournament.\n\nJames Rodriguez, the Golden Boot winner in the FIFA World Cup 2014, might have been past him prime in European club football, but he continues to be an important presence in Colombia's midfield. | Photo Credit: AP\n\nJames Rodriguez, the Golden Boot winner in the FIFA World Cup 2014, might have been past him prime in European club football, but he continues to be an important presence in Colombia's midfield. | Photo Credit: AP\n\nLiverpool winger Luis Diaz on the left only adds further firepower to the side, which beat Brazil, Spain, and Germany within the last year.\n\nThough potential challengers like the USA, Chile, and Mexico exist, it remains highly unlikely, given the experience and squad depth of the conventional favourites, that they pose more than a faint possibility of winning.\n\nLatest on SportstarUSA vs SA Live Score, T20 World Cup

They are looking to continue their virtually unstoppable run this summer in the United States and claim what would be Argentina's first back-back Copa America title this century.\n\nLionel Scaloni's men were sorted into Group A at Copa America 2024, and will play their first match against Canada on June 20. Although Argentina are the favorites to win the game (and the entire tournament), they are still coming out with their best possible lineup.\n\nHere's what Argentina's starting XI could look like against Canada in Atlanta.\n\nGK: Emiliano Mart\u00ednez - Mart\u00ednez has been Argentina's starting keeper for years, and the Aston Villa man has kept five out of six clean sheets in World Cup Qualifiers, a trend he will look to take into the Copa America.\n\nRB: Nahuel Molina - Although Montiel was the right-back on the pitch in the last Copa America final, Atletico Madrid's Molina has the spot locked down for this summer's campaign.\n\nCB: Cristian Romero - Romero is the leader of Argentina's defense and will take his rightful place on La Albiceleste's backline at Copa America 2024.\n\nCB: Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi - Otamendi is Romero's long-time center-back partner and has unmatched experience on the biggest stages in the world. Lisandro Mart\u00ednez, though, could just as easily start now that he is fully fit.\n\nLB: Nicol\u00e1s Tagliafico - Tagliafico is Scaloni's trusted left-back despite recent shouts for Acuna to take his job.\n\nCM: Rodrigo de Paul - Messi's \"bodyguard\" will play his 65th cap for Argentina against Canada after playing in 34 of Atletico Madrid's 38 LaLiga games this past season.\n\nCM: Leandro Paredes - Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez has recovered from his groin surgery, but Roma's Paredes has won the confidence of the manager in the Chelsea star's absence.\n\nCM: Alexis Mac Allister - Mac Allister only played 62 total minutes in Argentina's two Copa America tune-ups, so expect the Liverpool midfielder to be fresh and ready to start on Thursday.\n\nRW: Lionel Messi - Lionel Messi will of course lead his fellow teammates out of the tunnel in their first Copa America 2024 match. After scoring a brace against Guatemala last week, the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner looks to be in great form for the tournament.\n\nST: Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez - Although Lautaro Mart\u00ednez just scored two goals in Argentina's last international friendly, Manchester City's Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez will get the nod between Messi and Di Maria.\n\nLW: \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda - Despite his age, Di Mar\u00eda's impact and production on the wing for Argentina cannot be ignored, especially when he links up with Messi and \u00c1lvarez. Expect the Benfica forward to be one of the first substitutes, though, should Argentina pull away.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristian_Romero_(footballer,_born_1998)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cristian Romero (footballer, born 1998)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahuel_Molina", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nahuel Molina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Scaloni", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Scaloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol\u00e1s_Otamendi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atl\u00e9tico_Madrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisandro_Mart\u00ednez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lisandro Mart\u00ednez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Mac_Allister", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexis Mac Allister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzalo_Montiel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gonzalo Montiel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emiliano_Mart\u00ednez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emiliano Mart\u00ednez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leandro_Paredes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leandro Paredes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lautaro_Mart\u00ednez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lautaro Mart\u00ednez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol\u00e1s_Tagliafico", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicol\u00e1s Tagliafico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juli\u00e1n_\u00c1lvarez_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Fern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1ngel_Di_Mar\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.L._Benfica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.L.

Argentina, with the Copa America in 2021 and the World title a year later, is on the cusp of emulating the feat.\n\nDearer still to the Albiceleste will be Messi's swansong. He turns 37 four days after the showpiece kicks off, and the candid admission on running the home stretch of his storied career would serve as a trumpet blast for his teammates.\n\nThe subplots to this final story, though, are only partly in Argentina's hands and come with the imminent threat of straying the tale away from its desired end.\n\nThe tried and tested rule for Argentina\n\nThere are seldom suspicions on a unit that has a 36-match unbeaten streak to its record.\n\nIt comes as no surprise that Lionel Scaloni has entrusted, to a large extent, the names that got Argentina its third World Cup. Angel Di Maria, Rodrigo de Paul, Lautaro Martinez, Emiliano Martinez are among the names that bring the comfort of familiarity to the side.\n\nThe dash of youth comes from the Manchester United teenage sensation Alejandro Garnacho, who is set to get a significant role in the absence of Paulo Dybala, and Fiorentina striker Nicolas Gonzalez.\n\nRELATED: Messi out to fulfill American dream once again in Copa America 2024\n\nArgentina has lost just once in the 14 matches since its World Cup triumph, and its group in the Copa America, featuring Chile, Canada and Peru, should do little to throw it off track.\n\nThe old foe, Chile\n\nFew teams have snapped at Argentina's heels in the past decade the way its neighbour Chile has. The two Copa America final defeats in 2015 and 2016 had forced Messi into a submission, even if temporarily.\n\nThough it has a vastly changed roster now, Chile still has the services of veterans Claudio Bravo, Alexis Sanchez and Eduardo Vargas, who will play a crucial role in heralding an otherwise young squad.\n\nChile still has the services of veterans such as Alexis Sanchez, who will play a crucial role in heralding an otherwise young squad. | Photo Credit: Getty Images\n\nChile still has the services of veterans such as Alexis Sanchez, who will play a crucial role in heralding an otherwise young squad. | Photo Credit: Getty Images\n\nChile walks into the tournament with struggles of its own. It is languishing in eighth place in the South America World Cup qualifiers and has been marred by inconsistency lately. Ricardo Gareca coming on board as head coach at the start of this year has seen an uptick but a real turnaround will need a strong show in the headline event.\n\nALSO READ: All you need to know about the stadiums of Copa America 2024\n\nLa Roja was grouped with Argentina in the previous edition too and escaped with a point following a 1-1 draw. Similar returns against the heavyweight this time will only solidify its contention for making the knockouts.\n\nCanada no pushover\n\nHolding World Cup runner up France to a goalless draw in its last match before the big tournament will be a shot in the arm for Jesse Marsch's side.\n\nThe American is still new to the environment and would want to put the side's heartbreaking penalty shootout loss to archrival USA in the Gold Cup quarterfinal behind him.\n\nThe side's inspiring run in the World Cup, where it gave Belgium and Morocco a run for their money, holds the promise that it can punch above its weight in the Group A.\n\nNothing to lose for Peru\n\nPeru sits last in the South American World Cup qualifiers and has lost to Chile and Argentina in the past one year.\n\nALSO READ: All

Favourites, odds, prediction, expert picks for South American football tournament", "body": "The 2024 Copa America is building towards a highly-anticipated opening as the South American continental championship travels north to the United States.\n\nIn anticipation of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, to be held in the U.S. two years from now, CONMEBOL has decided to hold a special edition of the Copa America, inviting five CONCACAF participants to join alongside its 11 member nations.\n\nMost notably, the United States and Mexico will join the field, joining South American giants Argentina and Brazil in a loaded 16-nation competition that promises excitement, tension, and thrills.\n\nWorld Cup hero Lionel Messi leads the defending champions Argentina into what they hope will be a third straight major title in six years, while the rest of the field will aim to dethrone the in-form goliaths in what should be a truly memorable tournament.\n\nMORE: Prediction, betting odds, favourites for Euro 2024\n\nAs defending champions of both this competition and the FIFA World Cup, Argentina are huge favourites to win the 2024 Copa America.\n\nFellow South American power Brazil is also given a strong chance to win, with a big gap between the top two and the rest of the field. Third is Uruguay, who sprung upsets against both favourites in recent World Cup qualifying matches, while guest participants USA and Mexico are further back as joint-fifth favourites.\n\nOdds via Unibet AU. Last updated June 16.\n\nAt the 2024 Copa America, 16 teams have been broken down into four groups of four teams.\n\nQualification for the knockout stage is simple - teams must finish top two in their group to reach the quarterfinals. Unlike the European championships, no third-place finishers will reach the knockout stage. Top two in the group and you're in, bottom two and you're out.\n\nOdds via Unibet AU. Last updated June 16.\n\nArgentina are a juggernaut, especially while Lionel Messi takes the pitch. Yet even when the 36-year-old does not play, they still have the depth of talent to make up for it on a short-term basis, at least when it comes to the group stage. The Albiceleste were handed an extremely weak four-team group to coast through early in the tournament, so they should have no issues finishing with the maximum of nine points.\n\nBelow them is a bigger question. Canada have too many issues both internally and on the pitch, and Peru are just not strong enough of a side at this point. Chile is the best option to finish second at decent odds.\n\nPrediction: Argentina to win group, Chile to qualify (-105\n\nMexico are in real trouble here. While they've been handed a group without a strong semifinal contender, there is also no punching bag in this group either. El Tri are in awful form and have not enjoyed any kind of consistency the past four years from either a player or coaching standpoint.\n\nEcuador have been extremely strong in recent months, holding Argentina to just a single goal amidst their only World Cup qualifying defeat so far, and beating Uruguay back in mid-September. Jamaica are also no pushovers, coming agonisingly close to springing a sensational upset against the United States in the Nations League back in March after shocking Canada earlier in the competition.\n\nIf there's any top team set for a disappointing performance, it's Mexico, and without a clear punching bag in this group, they could find themselves on the wrong end of a few adverse results.\n\nThe United States are in a pickle here. While there is a clear talent gap between the top two and bottom two sides in Group C, leaving Uruguay and USA almost sure to qualify, there's very little room for error. Uruguay are in exceptional form at the moment, having beaten both Brazil and Argentina in World Cup qualifying in the past year.\n\nFor the USMNT to advance, they must not drop results against Panama or Bolivia. If they do that, it won't matter if they beat Uruguay to top the group. At this point, Uruguay have to be considered the favorites to win this group, as they are simply better than the United States both on paper and on the pitch.\n\nPrediction: Uruguay to win group, USA to qualify\n\nBrazil showed in March that they aren't to be trifled with, battling hard in friendlies against England and Spain, but their competitive form is woeful, sitting sixth in the World Cup qualifying standings through six games.\n\nColombia, on the other hand, are trending in the opposite direction. Los Cafeteros play a physical style of football and have done exceptionally well in limiting opposition chances while capitalising on their own. Brazil should see their way through the group, but Colombia will be up for the challenge of beating them to the top spot.\n\nAt this point, as defending champions of both the Copa America and World Cup, this tournament is Argentina's to lose. Lionel Messi continues to prove he has a lot left in the tank with Inter Miami, carving up MLS competition on a weekly basis, and around him is a squad bereft of any weaknesses.\n\nPlayers like Alexis Mac Allister, Rodrigo De Paul, and Julian Alvarez are in fine club form, and even the likes of Gio Lo Celso and Nico Gonzalez seem to step it up a notch when they join the national team setup. Only Lautaro Martinez struggles with a dip in form on the national team level, while everyone else comes together as a strong single unit.\n\nLionel Scaloni is a world-class coach, and he has been able to keep this squad glued together even as rumors of his potential exit swirl. They should prevail once again with relatively little drama.\n\nDark Horse: Uruguay\n\nNo South American side is more primed for a shock run through this tournament than Uruguay. Under Marcelo Bielsa's leadership, Uruguay beat both Brazil and Argentina last fall in World Cup qualifying, as La Celeste have kicked into gear.\n\nLike Argentina, Uruguay boast a host of players who seem to turn up their performances at the national team level compared to their clubs, such as Matias Vecino, Manuel Ugarte, and Facundo Pellistri. The presence of Fede Valverde will be an ace for this side, and Ronald Araujo leads a suffocating defence capable of playing both physically and possessionally.\n\nUruguay could very easily emerge from the Brazil/USA side of the bracket to meet Argentina in the final, and having beaten the reigning World Cup champions just last fall, they will be a formidable opponent and one who could find its way back to the top of the South American pecking order.\n\nStay away from: Brazil\n\nBrazil have never been more beatable. The Selecao seemed to show signs of a turnaround by beating England and drawing with Spain amidst two European friendlies back in March, but they still have significant issues to sort out. They were nearly beaten by Mexico in their first warmup friendly this June, and then held to a 1-1 draw by the United States, indicating the problems persist.\n\nMost of their struggles have come defensively, with Eder Militao only just returning from an ACL tear at the end of the club season, Ederson missing due to injury, and captain Marquinhos on the wrong side of 30. Casemiro was left out of the squad due to a regression with Manchester United, Neymar is out injured, and star forward Vinicius Jr. has to prove he does not drop his level with the national team, owning just three international goals in 28 appearances.\n\nAs second-favourites in a competition where Argentina would be expected to win even if Brazil were at near-full strength, there's no value in backing a weakened Brazil at just slightly above 2/1 odds. If they are to reach the final, it's expected they'll have to get through at least two of Uruguay, Colombia, and hosts United States. At this point, it wouldn't be a shock to see them upset by any of those three, and beating the defending champions in the final would require a minor miracle.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com",

Valverde, Diaz, Vinicius - who will take home the award?", "body": "Euro 2024: Scotland skipper Robertson says Switzerland draw was 'much more like us'\n\nSouth America is known for producing some of football's finest ever players and the Copa America will see some of the best current stars go head-to-head.\n\nThe 2024 tournament kicks off in a matter of days, with favourites Argentina and Brazil boasting squads packed with brilliant players.\n\nBut that is not where the talent ends, with some of Europe's finest performers last season also representing their respective nations in the United States.\n\nRead on as we pick out the contenders to take home the prize of the Copa America 2024's Golden Ball - the award handed to the best player at the tournament.\n\nThere can only be one place to start, with Lionel Messi surely still capable of producing more heroics for Argentina.\n\nThe eight-time Ballon d'Or has inspired La Albiceleste to two conseucitve tournament wins at the 2021 Copa America and then the 2022 World Cup.\n\nDespite since leaving European football in favour of a switch to Inter Miami, the 36-year-old still skippers Lionel Scaloni's team and will play a key role out in the USA.\n\nIf Argentina are to complete a third successive triumph, you can be sure their superstar forward will be heavily involved.\n\nAfter winning the Champions League and LaLiga with Real Madrid last season, glory in the Copa America with Brazil may just clinch the Ballon d'Or for Vinicius Jr.\n\nThat is unlikely to be the winger's priority at the tournament but he undoubtedly has the Selecao's hopes pinned on his shoulders.\n\nPoster boy in the past Neymar is out of the tournament with injury, meaning the 25-year-old will be Tite's talisman in attack.\n\nAnd with 35 goals involvements for Los Blancos last season, it is hard to think of another player who comes into the tournament in better form.\n\nColombia are backed to surprise a few at the Copa America and Liverpool forward Luis Diaz has firmly established himself as his country's main man.\n\nLos Cafeteros are on a 23-match unbeaten stretching back to March 2022 and while Diaz's five goals during that run hardly jump out of the page, there is little doubt who Colombia fans are expecting to produce when it matters.\n\nHe scored 13 goals for the Reds last seasomn during a season disrupted by the trauma of his father being kidnapped back in his home country.\n\nThat incident undoubtedly brought supporters together in support and if Colombia reach the semi-finals, the Anfield hero could well have an outside chance.\n\nUruguay are another who will be feeling optimistic and of all their top stars, midfielder Federico Valverde could be the most important for Marcelo Bielsa.\n\nThe Real Madrid ace is also a Champions League winner this season and has risen to become one of world football's top midfielders during his time at the Santiago Bernanbeu.\n\nHe is Uruguay's captain, embodying their energetic approach with his ability to perform all facets of the game superbly.\n\nExpect him to be at the heart of defence and attack for the Celeste, while his ability to score a stunner is another part of his artillery to watch out for.\n\nOther Brazilian and Argentinian stars to watch out for include Lautaro Martinez, Rodrygo and Julian Alvarez.\n\nMeanwhile, goalkeepers rarely win the award but Emiliano Martinez and Alisson Becker's contributions for club and country should not be underestimated.\n\nOf the outsiders, Christian Pulisic will be leading from the front for hosts USA, while Alphonso Davies will be tasked with inspiring Canada and Jamaica's Leon Bailey comes in off the back of a brilliant season for Aston Villa.\n\nThe Golden Ball award has been handed to a player from the triumphant nation in six of the last seven Copa America tournament and it would be no surprise to see that trend followed again.\n\nIt appears to be a toss up between Argentina and Brazil for the crown, so it is hard to look past either Messi or Vinicius.\n\nArgentina have become a tournament-winning machine and that's why we're backing Messi take home his third Golden Ball.", "source":

As Copa Am\u00e9rica holders and reigning World Cup champions, all eyes are on Argentina.\n\nRanked No. 1 in the world heading into the tournament, Lionel Scaloni will reach back into his trusty playbook to repeat past successes. Lionel Messi has not dipped in form following his move to MLS, while Alejandro Garnacho (19) and Valent\u00edn Carboni (19) are youthful additions to Argentina's talented squad.\n\nHowever, CONMEBOL and CONCACAF are two worlds of their own. Meaning, this bi-continental tournament is sure to throw up a few corkscrews. Are La Albiceleste simply invincible, or will they finally crack?\n\nIf they again lift the trophy, Argentina will have the most Copa Am\u00e9rica wins (16), breaking the tie with Uruguay.\n\nThe result on matchday two will be key to the shape of Group A as Chile face Argentina. The two heavyweights in the group will have this clash circled as a must-win to fight for the top spot.\n\nThe pair haven't met since 2022, and three of their last four meetings ended in a draw. The blue and white stripes lead total wins across all competitions. However, Chile beat Argentina twice in the Copa Am\u00e9rica final on penalties (2015 and 2016).\n\nLautaro Mart\u00ednez (Argentina)\n\nForget Lionel Messi here. Turn your attention to Lautaro Mart\u00ednez. The Serie A Player of the Season helped Inter lift another league title and the Italian Super Cup with 27 goals and seven assists in 44 games. Will he transfer club form to the international stage for Argentina?\n\nLuis Adv\u00edncula (Peru)\n\nPeru's aging forwards will need others to deliver scoring opportunities on a platter and Luis Adv\u00edncula is tasked with such a duty. As an offensive right-back, the 34-year-old is a strong passer with an eye for through balls. A Copa Am\u00e9rica and World Cup participant, he will be key to their attacking output.\n\nClaudio Bravo (Chile)\n\nWe're sure you know this name. Goalkeeper Claudio Bravo could be the make-or-break factor for Chile. He knows this tournament inside and out, playing a starring role in their two penalty shootout victories over Argentina. Yet at 41 with only seven appearances for Real Betis last season, is he still up to par to face deadly Argentina, crafty Peru and menaces Canada?\n\nStephen Eust\u00e1quio (Canada)\n\nIn a team craving maturity, Stephen Eust\u00e1quio is the blueprint. His knack for keeping tempo in midfield and visionary read of the pitch makes Canada tick. Some 19 goal involvements in 94 games for Porto isn't bad, either. He's also the free-kick and corner taker, who publicly asked his side to \"not be boys, and start to be men.\"\n\nThe football world will remember how Canada impressed against Belgium at the 2022 World Cup, holding Kevin De Bruyne, Thibaut Courtois, Romelu Lukaku and others to a 1-0 scoreline.\n\nHowever, the Canucks hired a new permanent manager just over one month before their Copa Am\u00e9rica opener against Argentina. How prepared are they under Jesse Marsch? And can they present themselves as considerable opponents or was 2022 a fluke?", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In the 1990s, the tournament was expanded to occasionally include teams from CONCACAF, the Central, North American and Caribbean soccer federation.\n\nThe 2024 edition will feature 16 national teams from South, Central and North America and will run from June 20 to July 14.\n\nIt will be only the second Copa America to take place outside of South America; The U.S. also hosted it in 2016.\n\nThe 32 matches will be played in 14 stadiums around the country, including AT&T Stadium in Arlington. Houston and Austin are also hosting games.\n\nAT&T Stadium will host three games:\n\nTickets for the three Copa America matches are on sale on SeatGeek through the AT&T Stadium website. At last check on Monday, plenty of tickets were available through the box office for all three games.\n\nThe match between the USMNT and Bolivia has tickets ranging from $81 (including fees) in the upper deck, all the way up to $366 (including fees) to be close to the field.\n\nTickets for the quarterfinal match are more expensive, ranging from $149 to $738 (including fees). There is a good chance that either Mexico or Argentina play in that game, depending on how the group stage goes. They could even face each other.\n\nFox Sports holds the English-language rights to broadcast the tournament, so fans will be able to watch every game on on Fox Sports, FS1 or FS2, or stream them on Fubo.\n\nFor Spanish-language broadcasts, Univision holds the rights and will be broadcasting all the games on its main channel, Unimas, TUDN, and ViX on streaming.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com",

It will stretch from coast to coast, capturing TV audiences throughout the Americas. It will feature megastars, like Lionel Messi, plus a vibrant array of Latino flair.\n\nOne of its core questions, though, is: Will casual fans in the host country care?\n\nMillions of Mexican Americans and Colombian Americans, of Argentine Americans and Venezuelan Americans, will joyously erupt for the Copa Am\u00e9rica. This, many of them know, is arguably the most competitive men's international soccer tournament in the four-year interim between World Cups.\n\nBut the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica, specifically, is a novelty in a country mostly unfamiliar with it.\n\nHere, then, is an attempt to familiarize you -- with the basics, the narratives, the problems, and the driving forces behind this one-of-a-kind event.\n\nCopa Am\u00e9rica is the South American men's soccer championship, a century-old competition among the continent's 10 national teams (and often others).\n\nIts cadence, size and format have varied over the years. Now, it's a quadrennial tournament much like the European Championship (Euros), played in even-year summers between men's World Cups.\n\nIt typically features 12 teams, with two invited from other continents. But in 2024, it will temporarily expand to 16. More on that below.\n\nIn South America, perhaps the planet's most soccer-crazed continent, it's a massive deal. It's historic, prestigious, anticipated, fiercely contested and festive. For years, it was massive enough to crush Messi -- before finally liberating him in 2021.\n\nOutside the Americas, it's a bit less so. Its global footprint is dwarfed by its European equivalent, the Euros. That, however, is largely due to western Europe's economic might -- and its willingness/eagerness to commercialize and market the sport.\n\nAt their core, the two tournaments are comparable. They're soccer's biggest outside the World Cup -- the toughest to win, the most lucrative, the most acclaimed. And this year's Copa Am\u00e9rica, in some ways, is even bigger.\n\nStruggling to find a satisfactory South American host, CONMEBOL -- the 10-member South American soccer confederation -- struck an agreement with CONCACAF, its North and Central American counterpart.\n\nCONCACAF would help organize the 2024 edition in the United States; in return, it would get six spots in a 16-team field.\n\nCopa Am\u00e9rica hosting duties typically rotate from one South American nation to the next -- from 1989-2011, for example, each of CONMEBOL's 10 members hosted once.\n\nIn recent years, though, the COVID-19 pandemic and instability have disrupted the rotation, and left organizers scrambling for stand-ins -- first Brazil, and now the U.S.\n\nIn 2024, it was supposed to be Ecuador's turn. But Ecuador, citing security and infrastructure concerns, relinquished the responsibility. \"We're not ready to organize the Copa Am\u00e9rica,\" said Francisco Egas, the president of its soccer federation, in November 2022. So, with less than two years to go, CONMEBOL did not know where its 2024 championship would be played.\n\nBrazil, its biggest, richest and most capable deputy, seemed willing and able to host. But Brazil had also hosted the previous two Copa Am\u00e9ricas -- first in 2019, in line with the standard rotation; and then in 2021 when Colombia and Argentina pulled out last-minute.\n\nSo, pushed by necessity but also pulled by financial and political benefits, CONMEBOL leaders turned to the States. Conversations accelerated at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. An agreement was reached and announced in early 2023.\n\nYep, but that one was even more novel. It was a one-off \"Centenario\" edition in 2016. It was not moved to the U.S.; rather, it was essentially created by the U.S. Soccer Federation, in partnership with CONMEBOL, one year after the regularly scheduled 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica, as a cash-grab and opportunity to pit the U.S. men's national team against elite opponents.\n\nPractically, though, the 2016 and 2024 tournaments will be very similar. Same format; six of the same host cities; 15 of the same 16 teams.\n\nIt was fairly successful. On the field, Chile beat Argentina in a glamorous but brutal final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. In the stands, 1.48 million tickets were sold, an average of roughly 46,000 per game. In total, the event generated a \"one-off profit of around $80 million\" for U.S. Soccer, its then-vice president, Carlos Cordeiro, said a few years later.\n\nThat's a complicated question.\n\nIn South America, fans always get excited about any Copa Am\u00e9rica, but some are unhappy that their crown jewel has been shipped off to North America again.\n\nIn North America, those who understand the gravity and importance of the tournament seem excited; but many non-Latinos in and around the American soccer community feel that the tournament has been poorly promoted and might fail to break through a crowded U.S. sports scene.\n\nCONMEBOL's commercial chief, Juan Emilio Roa, told Yahoo Sports that an estimated 25-30% of match-going fans would be ones traveling from South America; most of the rest will be U.S. residents.\n\nRoa told Yahoo Sports on June 7 that just over 1 million tickets had been sold -- a little more than 31,000 per game. That's around 50% of capacity across all games, most of which will be played at NFL stadiums.\n\nNaturally, matches featuring teams like Argentina and Mexico are close to or already sold-out; others, though, could be pretty empty.\n\nBy going to CONMEBOL's website, finding your desired stadium or game, and paying handsomely.\n\nOne reason that roughly 50% of tickets remain unclaimed is that the prices, to many, are obscene. A single upper-deck ticket for Argentina's opener against Canada, in the second-to-last row of Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, costs $307 at the time of writing. Even for Peru-Chile at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, the following day, a standard 200-level ticket costs $208. The average tournament-wide ticket price, according to Vivid Seats, is $283.\n\nIt's unclear who, exactly, is to blame for the obscene prices.\n\nRoa confirmed that they are based on the \"dynamic pricing\" model often utilized by American ticket brokers such as Ticketmaster and SeatGeek.\n\nFor a standard Copa Am\u00e9rica in South America, CONMEBOL would have complete control over all aspects of the matchday experience, including ticketing. But here, they have had to work with a variety of interested (and capitalistic) parties stadium-by-stadium, city-by-city. Rather than sell tickets on a single platform, they have essentially delegated that task to each venue -- some of which use Ticketmaster, some of which use SeatGeek.\n\nThe complexities, and the somewhat last-minute nature of all these arrangements, have been challenges, and presumably reasons that tickets did not go on sale until late February.\n\nThey're scattered across the U.S., in 14 different cities, with each hosting no more than three games.\n\nThe entire schedule is here. A Copa Am\u00e9rica schedule grid can be downloaded here.\n\nSome games, certainly in the knockout rounds, should be great. Others, between prideful but less-prominent teams stuck in cavernous NFL stadiums, will feel a bit soulless.\n\nThe tournament as a whole will probably struggle to differentiate itself from all the other high-level soccer being played in the United States this decade. But for CONMEBOL, financially, it will almost surely be successful.\n\n\"The North American market is an amazing market, in terms of everything -- in terms of viewerships, in terms of sponsorship, in terms of exposure,\" Roa said. The inclusion of Mexico's national team has likely allowed CONMEBOL to tap into many millions more dollars.\n\n\"And for sure, having Argentina and Leo Messi play in this Copa America ... increased the interest around the world,\" Roa added.\n\n\"We received calls and emails and contacts through our [commercial] agency, directly to CONMEBOL, from all around the world, como nunca antes, like never before,\" Roa said. \"Because, obviously, they have interests in the States. And all the things that happen in the States -- it takes another dimension.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The tournament could mark the 36-year-old Messi's final act with the national team. It could also give the number 10 a final push towards the 2026 World Cup. The early rounds of South American World Cup qualifiers suggest Messi's international run could be extended, as Argentina tops the qualifying after six matches. But a good performance at Copa America could prove decisive for his future. Midfielder Mac Allister will have a good opportunity to show he has developed further as a player if he can keep Argentina moving when Messi's energy goes down during games. Striker Martinez will have another chance to show a good club season for him in Europe can translate into great form with the national team.\n\nKey players: Pedro Gallese, Luis Adv\u00edncula, Gianluca Lapadula\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Fossati became Peru coach in December with the team at the bottom of the 10-team round robin South American World Cup qualifying. A goalless draw with Paraguay at home on June 7, amid Copa America preparations, suggests not much has improved since. Nothing seems to work on a team that is still tied to veteran players, like goalkeeper Gallese, defender Advincula and striker Lapadula. And newcomers don't seem ready to challenge. Fossati will not start the tournament under pressure, but a first-round elimination in a tough group could make his life in the Peru job difficult very soon.\n\nKey players: Claudio Bravo, Alexis S\u00e1nchez, Ben Brereton\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Chile has struggled to leave its golden generation behind, and its Copa America squad shows it. Goalkeeper Bravo (41) and striker Sanchez (35) are sure to be among the key players on a team that has struggled to compete against fitter rivals in recent years. Defender Gary Medel (36) and midfielder Arturo Vidal (37) didn't make the cut but were not far from being included. Gareca, who took Peru to the World Cup in 2018, has yet to find a starting lineup since he joined in January. A recent 3-0 win against Paraguay gave new hope to the team ahead of the tournament, but it is unlikely Chile will find such weak opposition at the start of the group stage.\n\nKey players: Alphonso Davies, Tajon Buchanan, Jonathan David\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Jesse Marsch took over as team manager in mid-May after spending a year at the helm of Leeds United. He has already managed a couple of warm-up matches for Copa America, a 4-0 loss to the Netherlands and 0-0 draw against France. After a disappointing World Cup in Qatar, where the team lost all three of its matches, Canada Soccer is hoping Marsch can do better against tough competition in Copa America, including facing off against reigning world champion Argentina.\n\nKey players: Santiago Gim\u00e9nez, Juli\u00e1n Qui\u00f1ones, Edson \u00c1lvarez.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Jaime Lozano made a surprising move before Copa America by leaving off veterans Guillermo Ochoa, Raul Jim\u00e9nez, Hirving Lozano and Jesus Gallardo, as well as Henry Martin, because he is trying to give new players a chance to prove they can compete for a spot in the 2026 World Cup. So far, the experiment is not going well. Mexico lost 4-0 against Uruguay and 3-2 against Brazil in friendlies ahead of the tournament, leaving many pundits wondering if the move to go younger at this moment was right. As the friendly games have shown, Mexico is weak on defense. Besides Ochoa's absence, the team has lost projected starting goalkeeper Luis Malag\u00f3n to an injury. Carlos Acevedo, who was called to replace Malag\u00f3n, has looked impressive in practice since his arrival and could be a surprising starter.\n\nKey players: Piero Hincapi\u00e9, Enner Valencia, Moises Caicedo\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Ecuador remains one of the most competitive national teams in South America, much of it due to a generation of players that has been developed at local clubs Independiente del Valle and Liga de Quito. It is in fifth position in the regional World Cup qualifying despite starting with -3 points due to a penalty. But it has yet to show it can play well. Striker Valencia is struggling to score for the national team, and midfielder Caicedo has yet to show the pace he had prior to his move to Chelsea. The team's defense is set to be a strength, led by defender Hincapi\u00e9, who had a great season with German champions Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nKey players: Jeferson Soteldo, Yangel Herrera, Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Venezuela seems set to qualify for the World Cup for the first time, and its strengths are likely to show during Copa America. The team's top form, which includes an away draw at Brazil in World Cup qualifying, was built by coach Jos\u00e9 Pekerman, who left the job in March last year without providing any explanation. When many feared Venezuela would once again tank, Batista managed to keep the team's up front power and improve its transitions. Midfielder Soteldo is recovering from a right thigh injury, and his health could be decisive for the team's future in the tournament.\n\nKey players: Bobby Decordova-Reid, Shamar Nicholson and Cory Burke.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: The Reggae Boyz will appear in the South American tournament for the third time looking to break a six-game losing streak. Its first opponent, Mexico, could be the most difficult one, despite the absence of some key players. Jamaica will miss Aston Villa's Leon Bailey despite being included in the 26-man roster. Bailey's agent Craig Butler said that Bailey decided to take a break from the team. Coach Heimir Hallgr\u00edmsson has been with the team since 2022 and had good moments in the League of Nations, including a win over Canada that secured their spot in Copa America.\n\nKey players: Federico Valverde, Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Luis Su\u00e1rez\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Bielsa has begun a rebuilding process in Uruguay, but he can't give up on veteran players as he assembles his squad for the tournament. Striker N\u00fa\u00f1ez had a reasonable season at Liverpool, in which he scored 18 goals in 54 matches. He is expected to step up as 37-year-old Edinson Cavani retired from the national team. N\u00fa\u00f1ez will have to count on veteran Su\u00e1rez, playing his fifth Copa America, to help him up front. Uruguay beat Mexico 4-0 in a friendly early in June to suggest that any rival that does not respect its strikers will suffer. Midfielder Valverde will be the team's leader in the U.S.\n\nKey players: Christian Pulisic, John Sargent, Folarin Balogun\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: The U.S. has already proven to be the top team in CONCACAF after beating Mexico in the League of Nations final for the second year in a row. Copa America gives the Americans an opportunity to show they can give the South Americans trouble. The team lost 5-1 to Colombia, a nation that is riding a 22-game unbeaten streak, but then played a good match against Brazil, one of the top two contenders alongside Argentina. The U.S. team looks to be the favorite to move on to the second round with Uruguay, although Panama will be tough to beat. The problem for the Americans should they finish second behind Uruguay is there's a good chance they would meet Brazil in the quarterfinals.\n\nKey players: Michael Murillo, Adalberto Carrasquilla, Luis Mej\u00eda\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Under Thomas Christensen, the Panamanians have shown consistent progress even though they missed the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Christiansen remains at the helm despite that and last year the team was the runner-up in the Gold Cup and this year they made their way to the Nations League semifinals. Led by the Houston Dynamo's Adalberto Carrasquilla, the player of the tournament in last year's Gold Cup, Panama will try to upset the group favorites Uruguay and the United States. The team arrives at the tournament after securing a couple of victories in the CONCACAF qualifiers against Guyana and Montserrat. The 'Canaleros' will have a final warmup against Paraguay before facing Uruguay.\n\nKey players: Carlos Lampe, Gabriel Villamil, C\u00e9sar Menacho\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Bolivia has had a slow start under coach Zago, as its penultimate place in South American World Cup qualifying shows, but the team continues to field young players while looking to the future. Bolivia's hopes in Copa America lie in players who are more like 24-year-old striker Menacho, one of the top goal scorers of his country's national championship. A few veterans remain, including goalkeeper Lampe. The team will miss striker Marcelo Martins, who retired in March at age 36. Unlike most of its competitors, Bolivia's squad mostly includes local players.\n\nKey players: Vinicius J\u00fanior, Endrick and Lucas Paquet\u00e1\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: New coach, new starters and no Neymar. Brazil is likely to be competitive at Copa America as the team's performances in friendlies this year suggest, but it is hard to see J\u00fanior's team as heavy favorites. There are a few evident starters in goalkeeper Alisson, defender \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o, midfielder Paquet\u00e1 and winger J\u00fanior but that is about it. Teenager Endrick has delivered goals since he was first called up to the senior team in March, but Brazil's coach has not yet decided whether he or Rodrygo will start. Brazil's bench is filled with players getting their first opportunity with the national team.\n\nKey players: Jefferson Lerma, James Rodr\u00edguez, Luis D\u00edaz\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Unbeaten for 18 matches, Colombia is one of the favorites to win Copa America, something the team has not done in 23 years. Before beating the United States 5-1 amid preparations for the tournament, Colombia beat Brazil 2-1 in South American World Cup qualifying and topped both Spain and Germany in friendlies in Europe. Midfielder Rodr\u00edguez, who has struggled to play for his clubs in recent years, has delivered good performances for the national team. Colombia is in third place in World Cup qualifying, and a convincing campaign at Copa America could make its physical and skillful team aim higher in the next few years.\n\nKey players: Diego G\u00f3mez, Gustavo G\u00f3mez, Miguel Almir\u00f3n\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Paraguay will use Copa America and the Paris Olympics to try to secure a spot at the 2026 World Cup. Garnero is trying to rejuvenate his squad with the support of two key veterans: defender G\u00f3mez, one of the best on the continent since he arrived in Brazil's Palmeiras, and veteran striker Almir\u00f3n. The performances of 21-year-old midfielder G\u00f3mez of Inter Miami will be key for the Paraguayans to have any hopes of getting through the group. The tournament will also help the coach adjust his team to recover in World Cup qualifying, which currently sees Paraguay in 7th, out of the qualification zone.\n\nKey players: Francisco Calvo, Joel Campbell and Manfred Ugalde\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: After leading Ecuador to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, Alfaro became the Ticos' coach last November, replacing Luis Fernando Su\u00e1rez. Under Alfaro, the team is making a transition and several key players from the past are gone, including iconic goalkeeper Keylor Navas and veterans Celso Borges and Bryan Ruiz, leaving Joel Campbell and Francisco Calvo as the only veterans on the squad. Costa Rica has won its two World Cup qualifiers against Grenada and Saint Kitts and Nevis and had a 0-0 draw against Uruguay on May 31. Alfaro and his players know sharing the group with Brazil and Colombia, two of the contenders in the tournament, will not be an easy task, especially with a young team facing its first major test.",

According to analyses based on Bet365 betting odds and the supercomputer Oddspedia, Argentina is the favorite, with a 43.8% chance of being crowned champion. This optimism is underpinned by their recent success at the 2022 World Cup and their victory at the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica. With Lionel Messi leading a team that combines experience and talent, Argentina is expected to dominate the tournament, facing its main rival, Brazil, which has a 15.4% probability. Other teams with high expectations are Uruguay and Mexico, with Uruguay having a 12.3% chance of reaching the semifinals, and Mexico being seen as a possible surprise package with a 10.4% chance of winning the tournament.\n\nOn the other hand, the United States and Colombia face less favorable odds. Despite a promising recent draw against Brazil, Gregg Behalter's team is expected to be one of the disappointments of the tournament, with only a 4.7% chance of litfing the trophy. Mexico, despite doubts in their preparation, could reach the semifinals by beating teams like Ecuador and Colombia, who will have a harder time advancing beyond the quarterfinals. In terms of odds, Argentina leads with a +175 odds, followed by Brazil with +225 and Uruguay with +500. The combination of historical and current data in 1,000 simulations made by Oddspedia reinforces the perception that Argentina is well positioned to triumph in this edition of the Copa Am\u00e9rica. This is the schedule for the group matches to be played by all participating countries, and the knock-out stages.\n\nThe opening ceremony and inaugural match will be available to a global audience, with multiple options on both television and streaming platforms.

At +175 odds, they've been given an implied probability of 36.36% of hoisting the trophy.

Others are lesser known outside their countries, and Copa America will give them a chance to showcase their skills to fans and scouts all over the world.\n\nHere are 16 players to keep an eye on:\n\nThe Inter Miami star and eight-time Ballon d'Or winner felt a giant load lifted off his shoulders when Argentina won the 2022 World Cup, as that trophy was the only one missing from his illustrious resume. But he wants more and would love to see Argentina defend its Copa America title. He turns 37 on June 24 and has Miami in first place in the MLS standings with 12 goals and 13 assists in 12 games.\n\nIf you're looking for an up-and-coming player to watch, keep an eye on this 20-year-old Santos midfielder they call \"Miguelito.\" La Verde will miss retired Marcelo Martins Moreno, But Terceros is entertaining and has plenty of upside.\n\nSuperstar Neymar is injured, so Vinicius Junior will take center stage for Brazil. The 23-year-old Real Madrid forward, known for his speed and dribbling, became the youngest player to score in two Champions League finals, beating Lionel Messi's record by 13 days. He also was named the UEFA Champions League Player of the Season with six goals and five assists. He also is known for his anti-racism activism. P.S. Watch out for 17-year-old left-footed striker Endrick, who will join Real Madrid next season and scored for Brazil in a friendly against England at Wembley in March.\n\nThe only Canadian ever to score in a World Cup, Davies is a team captain and the face of Canadian soccer. The 23-year-old Bayern Munich defender is a top-10 scorer for Canada, has five Bundesliga titles, a Champions League title and Club World Cup trophy.\n\nLeft-footed winger was a key player for Danish champions Midtjylland and scored a late goal in a friendly against France. Chile won Copa America in 2015 and 2016, and Osorio is among the new players who could bring them back to glory.\n\nParticipating in his third Copa America for Los Cafeteros. In 2021, the Liverpool winger scored four times (including goals against host Brazil and eventual champ Argentina) and finished tied with Messi as joint top scorer in the Copa America. He scored against Germany in a 2-0 friendly win last June and recorded a brace as Colombia beat Brazil 2-1 in World Cup qualification in November.\n\nHe is usually the smallest man on the field at 5-8 and 150 pounds, but he packs a big punch. At 22, the former teen phenom and Spartak Moscow forward is ready to make international headlines for Los Ticos.\n\nChelsea paid Brighton $146 million dollars to sign Caicedo, a 22-year-old defensive midfielder who is considered one of the best players in the world at his position. Liverpool was also courting him. He made 48 appearances for Chelsea and is one reason Ecuador could pull surprises during this tournament.\n\nThe 34-year-old West Ham forward was born in England but represents Jamaica. In 2021, he became West Ham's all-time leading scorer. He is known for his versatility, as he has played right back, right midfielder, winger and forward for West Ham.\n\nIn 2023, a year after being dropped from the Mexican World Cup team, the 23-year-old Argentina-born forward led Feyenoord to its second Dutch title this century with 15 goals in 32 games. This season, he scored 23 goals and the team finished in second place. Last July, he scored in the 88th minute to lift Mexico to a 1-0 victory over Panama in the CONCACAF Gold Cup final.\n\nMajor League Soccer fans know Carrasquilla as a talented, creative Houston Dynamo midfielder, and the 25-year-old is already a mainstay on the Panama team. He will be one of the bright spots for a team that will have trouble advancing.\n\nAfter helping lead Atlanta United to the 2018 Cup title, Almiron commanded an MLS record transfer fee from Newcastle of the English Premier League. He has played games for the Magpies, scoring a career-best 11 goals last season to help the club qualify for the Champions League for the first time in two decades.\n\nWith 16 goals in 73 appearances, Peru will count on Flores. He participated at the 2018 FIFA World Cup and was the joint top scorer for Peru in the qualifiers. He plays forward for Peruvian Liga 1 club Universitario de Deportes, on loan from Liga MX club Atlas. He previously played for D.C. United.\n\nThe face of the U.S. national team, Pulisic, nicknamed \"Captain America,\" is in peak form after his first year in Italy with AC Milan. The 25-year-old winger has scored a career-high 12 goals across all competitions with two months of the Serie A season remaining. He previously spent four years with Chelsea of the English Premier League and three with Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund.\n\nEdison Cavani retired and 37-year-old Inter Miami forward Luis Suarez, Uruguay's all-time leading scorer, will be a locker room leader. But 24-year-old Darwin Nunez, making his Copa America debut, is the player to watch. Liverpool paid a record transfer fee to get him from Benfica two years ago and he has scored 33 goals over all competitions for the club. He scored a hat trick last week in a 4-0 Copa tune-up win over Mexico and five goals in World Cup qualifying against Colombia, Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia (2).\n\nThe 34-year-old is on fire, leading Mexican club Pachuca to the CONCACAF Champions Cup title with nine goals in seven games. He has 10 goals in 21 Liga MX games and will be a handful for defenders.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

to start Copa defence in style | LiveScore", "body": "- Argentina have scored three or more goals in three of their last four matches\n\n- Canada failed to win any of their three games at the 2022 World Cup, conceding seven goals\n\n- Recommended bet: Argentina to score over 2.5 goals\n\nArgentina facing Canada in Atlanta, Georgia, might not be the most traditional of Copa America curtain-raisers, but it promises to be an enthralling opener nonetheless and one the defending champions can excel in.\n\nThe Canucks won admirers two years ago at the Qatar World Cup but failed to win any points and they face an equally tough test in the Copa America, with their opening game against Argentina surely the hardest of the lot.\n\nArgentina have named a strong squad with a starting line-up likely to resemble the one that lifted the World Cup in Qatar.\n\nNicolas Otamendi and Cristian Romero will be the centre-back pairing, while Lionel Messi will be the star of the show and Angel Di Maria will make his final appearances in an Argentina shirt before retiring.\n\nMidfield trio Alexis Mac Allister, Enzo Fernandez and Rodrigo De Paul will be bolstered by the return of Giovani Lo Celso, who was injured in 2022.\n\nCanada have no injury concerns, with star men Alphonso Davies and Jonathan David both fit and available.\n\nArgentina have won 17 of their last 20 games in normal time - 14 of those to nil - while two penalty shootout successes and one defeat make up those results.\n\nCanada lost all three 2022 World Cup matches - 1-0 to Belgium, 4-1 to Croatia and 2-1 to Morocco - and have won only five of their 14 matches since, against minnows Curacao, Honduras, Panama, Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago.\n\nCanada could not have asked for a harder introduction to the Copa America than facing the holders and world champions, Argentina, and there is little in Canada's recent record to suggest they can cause an upset.\n\nFormer Leeds and RB Leipzig manager Jesse Marsch was only parachuted into the Canada role last month and he arrives with the Canucks not in the greatest shape.\n\nTheir 2022 World Cup displays offered some encouragement but they lacked the big-game nous to turn lively performances into points and have regressed since.\n\nIn last summer's Concacaf Gold Cup, Canada finished second to Guatemala in the group stage, drawing 2-2 with Guadeloupe and Guatemala, before losing to USA in the first knockout round.\n\nA recent 0-0 friendly draw against France has to be put into the context of the French players being keen to avoid injury on the eve of Euro 2024 and three days prior to that Canada had been routed 4-0 by the Netherlands.\n\nArgentina have been imperious in recent years, winning the 2021 Copa America and 2022 World Cup, and have shown no sign of slowing down since.\n\nA record of 13 victories in 14 games since lifting the World Cup trophy includes a win over Brazil.\n\nBack Argentina to score over 2.5 goals at 7/5

He should be expected to let his players do their thing, so Enzo Fernandez and Alexis Mac Allister will be tasked with getting the ball forward.\n\nRodrigo De Paul will do the dirty work in midfield, Julian Alvarez will make off-ball runs in the final third, and an Inter Miami forward will be the key to unlocking opposition defences.\n\nLionel Messi. No need to explain this one.\n\nAs holders of the World Cup and Copa America, nothing short of another trophy will be seen as a success for Argentina. This will almost certainly be Lionel Messi's last Copa America, so he and his teammates will want to see him go out on top.\n\nCurrent FIFA Ranking: #32\n\nCopa America History: 33 previous appearances; best result: Champions (1939, 1975)\n\nMajor International Trophies: Two Copas America\n\nJorge Fossati only took over the Peru job at the start of 2024 and will make his competitive debut in charge of them at the Copa, so we cannot say too much about his tactics.\n\nBased on a few friendlies, we can predict a 3-5-2 formation that will look more like a 5-3-2 as they spend most of their time defending against stronger opponents.\n\nOrlando City goalkeeper Pedro Gallese could be playing his last Copa America in the US. If so, his side will need him to save his best for last as he can expect a good few shots to come his way in all matches.\n\nAlthough Peru are the second-highest ranked team in Group A as far as FIFA is concerned and were drawn from Pot 2, it would be tough to suggest that they are the second-best team in the group.\n\nThey have reached the semi-finals in four of the last five editions of this tournament, but that record is likely to take a hit this year.\n\nCurrent FIFA Ranking: #42\n\nCopa America History: 40 previous appearances; best result: Champions (2015, 2016)\n\nMajor International Trophies: Two Copas America\n\nFormer Peru manager Ricardo Gareca, who led them to a memorable final in 2019, is in a similar position to Fossati, having only taken charge of Chile in January.\n\nHe was hired after their worst-ever start to CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying, with the hope that his famed 4-4-2 block brings them much-needed defensive stability.\n\nChile are in transition between generations as Arturo Vidal has not been included in the squad and Alexis Sanchez did not see much club action in 2023/24.\n\nMeanwhile, Marcelino Nunez and Dario Osorio are being heralded as the country's next big talents. However the experience and stability of Erick Pulgar could prove crucial in the heart of the midfield.\n\nGiven their coaching change and dismal World Cup qualifying campaign, hopes cannot be too high for Chile going into the Copa.\n\nAlthough they will try their best to avoid it, they could be knocked out of the group stage for the first time in two decades.\n\nCurrent FIFA Ranking: #49\n\nCopa America History: N/A\n\nMajor International Trophies: Two CONCACAF Championships/Gold Cups\n\nThe final team in Group A also have a new head coach in Jesse Marsch, but his previous track record makes it easy to picture what his side will look like.\n\nCanada should line up in a 4-4-2 formation and look to press to some extent off the ball, while their attacking play will be marked by quick interplay.\n\nIt is hard to believe that Alphonso Davies is only 23 years old, as he has been part of the Canadian national team since 2017.\n\nAlthough he will start at left-back, Marsch has stated his intentions to make the most of him in an attacking sense, so he could be the difference-maker in the final third.\n\nIt would be unfair to ask too much of Canada on their Copa America debut, especially in a group where they are the lowest-ranked team.\n\nHowever, their rivals' issues mean they have a golden opportunity to make it to the knockout stage and should aim for that at least.\n\nCurrent FIFA Ranking: #14\n\nCopa America History: Ten previous appearances; best result: Runners-up (1993, 2001)\n\nMajor International Trophies: 12 CONCACAF Gold Cups\n\nJaime Lozano took over the Mexican national team job precisely 12 months ago, having previously spent three years with the under-23s between 2018 and 2021.\n\nA focus on youth development seems to be his agenda based on his squad selection, and his tactics are also quite progressive as he sets his side to patiently dominate the ball in a 4-3-3 formation.\n\nLozano will rely on a bit of individual brilliance in the final third, and based on the profiles in the predicted starting XI, Julian Quinones is likeliest to provide that.\n\nHis side will hope to see his brilliant domestic form for Liga MX champions Club America carry over to the Copa.\n\nMexico are the highest-ranked team in Group B but are a little tough to predict given the squad overhaul Lozano has undertaken. Their aim will be a knockout spot at least.\n\nCurrent FIFA Ranking: #29\n\nCopa America History: 29 previous appearances; best result: Semi-finals (1959, 1993)\n\nMajor International Trophies: N/A\n\nFormer Qatar manager Felix Sanchez has not changed his ways after joining the side that rather humbled the Maroons on their World Cup debut at home.\n\nSo, expect Ecuador to look to dominate possession and slow things down, making their games very low-scoring affairs.\n\nMoises Caicedo might not have had the smoothest season for Chelsea, but he will remain a key figure in this Ecuador side thanks to his quality and role in implementing Sanchez's style of play by dictating the tempo of the game from midfield.\n\nEcuador are one of just two CONMEBOL teams to have never won the Copa and have been knocked out of the group stage on seven of the last nine occasions.\n\nThey have a golden chance to go through to the knockout stage owing to their quality and balance as well as their opponents' weaknesses.\n\nCurrent FIFA Ranking: #54\n\nCopa America History: 19 previous appearances; best result: Semi-finals (2011)\n\nMajor International Trophies: N/A\n\nHistorically and at present, Venezuela are one of the weakest teams in CONMEBOL.\n\nAn acceptance of that is reflected in their tactics, which are very defence-focused and often involve setting up in a 5-4-1 low block out of possession against such strong opponents.\n\nHaving conceded just three goals in World Cup qualifying, they have yielded the rewards of this approach of late.\n\nYangel Herrera was quietly important for the high-flying Girona even though more eye-catching players like Aleix Garc\u00eda stole the spotlight.\n\nBetween his high-volume defensive work rate and ability to pop up in the danger area at the right times to score, he has everything Venezuela need to execute their style of play.\n\nVenezuela had to pack their bags without a win at the last Copa, so they will hope to change that this year. If they do manage to pick up three points from a single match, a knockout spot won't seem far out of reach at all.\n\nCurrent FIFA Ranking: #55\n\nCopa America History: Two previous appearances; best result: Group stage (2015, 2016)\n\nMajor International Trophies: N/A\n\nHeimir Hallgrimsson was the famed dentist who led Iceland in an unforgettable 2016 European Championship campaign, so Jamaica will hope to see a repeat of that eight years on.\n\nHe will set his side up to defend in a very compact block and punch back on the counter, making the most of the quality of their wingers.\n\nLeon Bailey will not be at the Copa despite being named in the squad due to an ongoing dispute with the Jamaica Football Federation, so former Leicester City winger Demarai Gray will have to step up and deliver to ensure that the Reggae Boyz still pose a significant attacking threat.\n\nJamaica have appeared at the Copa America twice in the past but are yet to take away a point or even score a goal at the tournament. At the very least, they should look to change that this time around.\n\nCurrent FIFA Ranking: #11\n\nCopa America History: Five previous appearances; best result: Semi-finals (1995, 2016)\n\nMajor International Trophies: Seven CONCACAF Championships/Gold Cups\n\nGregg Berhalter has done a decent amount of chopping and changing in his time as US head coach, but he seemed to find a formula for the Copa at the very end of the CONCACAF Nations League: a 4-3-3 formation with advancing full-backs and two of Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah and Tyler Adams supporting one free creator in Giovanni Reyna.\n\nJust a few months ago, it was unclear where Giovanni Reyna would even be starting for the US at the Copa America. His creative threat will be the key to unlocking the deep defences of Panama and Bolivia to get them through to the knockout stage.\n\nThe US are the best-ranked CONCACAF team at this tournament so they will hope to go through to the semi-finals. A knockout spot is the bare minimum expectation.\n\nCurrent FIFA Ranking: #15\n\nCopa America History: 45 previous appearances; best result: Champions (1916, 1917, 1920, 1923, 1924, 1926, 1935, 1942, 1956, 1959, 1967, 1983, 1987, 1995, 2011)\n\nMajor International Trophies: Two FIFA World Cups, 15 Copas Am\u00e9rica\n\nAll you need to know about Uruguay's tactics is that they are coached by Marcelo Bielsa. They will press and defend with great intensity against any opponents and look to pose a fairly direct attacking threat.\n\nDarwin Nunez will epitomise Bielsa's style of play with nonstop pressing and relentless attacking movement. Uruguay's defence seems pretty sorted but where they will get their goals from is a bit of a question, so they will hope the Liverpool forward can answer it.\n\nIn a tournament where none of the top contenders seem perfectly balanced, the well-roundedness of this Uruguay side and their defensive solidity could be the platform they build on to lift their first trophy in over a decade.\n\nCurrent FIFA Ranking: #45\n\nCopa America History: One previous appearance; Group Stage (2016)\n\nMajor International Trophies: N/A\n\nThomas Christensen has done a tremendous job with Panama since taking charge in 2020.\n\nHe has won precisely half of his 62 matches in charge of Los Canaleros, guiding them to the Nations League knockouts and taking them up 40-odd spots in the FIFA rankings.\n\nHe has done so by establishing an expansive possession-based style of play that is sure to impress viewers.\n\nHouston Dynamo midfielder Adalberto Carrasquilla is Panama's best and most well-rounded player. He is excellent on the ball thanks to his close control and forward passing, but will have to work hard to keep things tight defensively.\n\nPanama may be slightly disappointed to have been drawn in Group C with two clearly stronger teams because they could have had a serious shot at the knockouts in another place like Group A. Still, expect them to give the favourites a decent run for their money.\n\nCurrent FIFA Ranking: #85\n\nCopa America History: 28 previous appearances; best result: Champions (1963)\n\nMajor International Trophies: One Copa America\n\nBolivia are the lowest-ranked team at the Copa America and are far from the most enjoyable to watch. The only realistic chance they have at getting a result is by frustrating their opponents in a low block for ninety minutes and hoping to get a lucky break going forward.\n\nThis Bolivia side is desperately short of creativity, but one man who might be able to conjure up something is Ramiro Vaca. He has six assists to his name for domestic giants Bolivar this year, including two in the Copa Libertadores.\n\nThe only reason Bolivia are a respectably competitive team in CONMEBOL is the massive home advantage they get in the heights of La Paz, but their record is rather dismal closer to sea level. So, even a point or two would be a good outcome for them at this tournament.\n\nCurrent FIFA Ranking: #5\n\nCopa America History: 37 previous appearances; best result: Champions (1919, 1922, 1949, 1989, 1997, 1999, 2004, 2007, 2019)\n\nMajor International Trophies: Five FIFA World Cups, Nine Copas America\n\nBrazil have endured a fair bit of turmoil since the 2022 FIFA World Cup as coaches have come and gone and an identity crisis has developed.\n\nJust two wins in four matches under Dorival Junior has not been an ideal start, but he will hope that the star power of his players shines through in their fluid possession-based approach.\n\nChampions League winner Vinicius Junior has been one of the most exciting wingers in world football over the last couple of seasons, but he has not won any major trophies with his national team.\n\nWhen push comes to shove on the big day, he could well take matters into his own hands and come up with a moment of magic that makes the difference.\n\nBrazil only ever enter any international tournament to try and win it, but they will face a couple of tough challenges this time. As long as they do not create any problems for themselves, it is always tough to bet against them.\n\nCurrent FIFA Ranking: #12\n\nCopa America History: 23 previous appearances; best result: Champions (2001)\n\nMajor International Trophies: One Copa America\n\nNestor Lorenzo is yet to taste defeat after two years in charge of Colombia, so his 4-2-3-1/4-3-1-2 system is clearly working brilliantly.\n\nColombia's narrowness makes them tough to play through and allows them to get a good deal of attackers in dangerous central positions, so they have found a great balance with this approach.\n\nLuis Daaz was the top scorer at the last Copa America and should look to repeat the trick. With an even more solid base in the side supporting him both defensively and by feeding him the ball, the Liverpool winger will get a fair few chances to make that happen.\n\nColombia only have one major international trophy to their name, but they could well be dark horses to get a second this time around.\n\nLike Uruguay, they will count on their well-roundedness and stability to give them the upper hand against opponents who are stronger on paper.\n\nCurrent FIFA Ranking: #56\n\nCopa America History: 38 previous appearances; best result: Champions (1953, 1979)\n\nMajor International Trophies: Two Copas America\n\nParaguay have played six World Cup qualification matches so far in this cycle, and not a single one of those games has seen multiple goals scored. Like many underdogs, they will adopt a defence-focused approach in a low block and look to frustrate their opponents.\n\nPalmeiras' Gustavo Gomez will lead Paraguay's defensive effort as captain and centre-back, so he will play a crucial role in terms of winning duels and marshalling the back line to ensure it is not breached from elsewhere.\n\nParaguay cannot realistically consider themselves better than Brazil or Colombia, but the least they can do is give themselves a chance by making life difficult for their opponents.\n\nCurrent FIFA Ranking: #52\n\nCopa America History: Five previous appearances; best result: Quarter-finals (2001, 2004)\n\nMajor International Trophies: Three CONCACAF Championships/Gold Cups\n\nGustavo Alfaro took charge of Costa Rica less than a year ago in November, but even in such a short time he has used everything from a 4-2-3-1 to back-five formation.\n\nEither way, defensive solidity must be the number one priority, while the right amount of freedom for the attackers could make something happen up front.\n\nWithout experienced campaigners such as Keylor Navas, Costa Rica will have quite a youthful team at the Copa.\n\nTheir front line could well be comprised entirely of under-23s, but even among them the experience of Manfred Ugalde will stand out.\n\nHe has been in Europe since 2020 and has done well in Belgium and the

So could this tournament be the last dance?\n\nWith his 37th birthday to come next week, Messi faces an uphill battle to make it to the World Cup in 2026, a sad truth he appears to have accepted himself.\n\n'There's a while left and I don't know how I'm going to be at that moment,' he recently said about his chances of playing at another major competition.\n\n'Age is also a reality that is there, although it is a number, the games that I am going to play are not the same as the ones I played when I was in Europe in competition, which were every three days, or in the Champions League or in the League where I was, both in France and in Spain.\n\n'But it depends on how I feel and how I feel when I'm next to my teammates and see if I'm still up to the task or not.'\n\nMessi could well be gearing up for his final international tournament as an Argentina player\n\nThe soccer legend - who captained his country to World Cup glory in 2022 - turns 37 in a few days and faces an uphill battle to make the next World Cup in 2026\n\nMessi will turn 39 in the summer of 2026, meaning the odds are stacked against him remaining an important member of Argentina's squad up until that point.\n\nThis tournament, then, will likely serve as a grand international farewell for a player many consider the greatest of all time. That alone is enough reason not to miss it.\n\nUSMNT on home soil\n\nIt promises to be a memorable summer for hosts USA, though whether that's out of pride or misery remains to be seen.\n\nEight years on from the last time they staged the competition, there is far greater expectation on the Stars and Stripes to enjoy another deep run after their fourth-place finish in 2016.\n\nGregg Berhalter has plenty of talent at his disposal with the likes of Christian Pulisic, Yunus Musah, Weston McKennie, Gio Reyna, Tyler Adams and Antonee Robinson on the roster, though it is Pulisic who will undoubtedly prove key.\n\nIf the AC Milan forward can keep momentum going after an impressive season at club level - which saw him record 20 goal involvements in 36 Serie A games - then Berhalter's team will stand every chance of making it to the semifinals once more.\n\nChristian Pulisic's form will be crucial to hosts USA going far at this summer's tournament\n\nThe USMNT roster is packed with talent, including young forward Gio Reyna (center)\n\nGregg Berhalter will be under serious pressure to keep his job if it ends in an early elimination\n\nToppling a giant like Brazil or Argentina will still be a tall order, despite their 1-1 friendly draw against the former last week.\n\nYet, if they can beat Uruguay to top spot in Group C and get the better of what will likely be Colombia, Paraguay or Costa Rica in the quarterfinals, while also playing an exciting attacking game throughout, USA can bring the curtain down on its second home tournament with plenty of optimism ahead of the 2026 World Cup.\n\nAn early exit and some underwhelming displays, on the other hand, and Berhalter is unlikely to still be in charge by the time it comes around.\n\nAll eyes on Marsch\n\nShould Berhalter's position come under threat, the obvious candidate to replace him after the Copa America will be Jesse Marsch should he propel Canada into the knockout stages.\n\nMarsch, who was only appointed Canada head coach last month, has a difficult task on his hands in making it out of a group consisting of reigning champions Argentina, Peru and Chile.\n\nYet after holding European giants France to a 0-0 stalemate last weekend, the Reds have shown they have the defensive mettle to go toe-to-toe with anyone.\n\nMarsch came close to taking over as USMNT boss last year, only to fume at the treatment afforded to him when Berhalter's contract was instead renewed.\n\nJesse Marsch will be looking to make a statement with Canada after being snubbed by USMNT\n\n'My respect for U.S. Soccer is big, but I went through a process with them, right? And I'm not going to go into it, but I wasn't treated very well in the process,' the former Leeds United and RB Leipzig boss said on CBS' \"Call it What You Want\" podcast.\n\n'And so, whatever man, that's in the past now. The minute it was done I was like, \"OK, I'm moving forward, and I'm going to figure out what's right for me.\"'\n\nAs one of the most high-profile coaches in the States, Marsch taking the USMNT helm at some point in the future seems a no-brainer.\n\nThe 50-year-old's influence on Canada this summer will therefore be under the microscope as he looks to make a statement after being snubbed by his home country.\n\nBallon d'Or beckons for Vini\n\nWhisper it quietly, but the Copa America may just feature the next winner of the prestigious Ballon d'Or award.\n\nVinicius Jr is the frontrunner to clinch this year's gong after another masterful club season with Real Madrid, which ended with him scoring in their Champions League final triumph over Borussia Dortmund at Wembley Stadium.\n\nVinicius Jr can move a step closer to the Ballon d'Or by inspiring Brazil to the title this summer\n\nThe 23-year-old scored in Real Madrid's Champions League final victory earlier this month\n\nHe is now in pole position to be crowned the best player in world soccer later this year\n\nThe Brazilian forward, 23, scored 24 goals in 39 games to help Madrid seal both Europe's major club prize and the Spanish title, leaving him in pole position to be crowned the best player in the world.\n\nHis Los Blancos teammate Jude Bellingham is running him close in the Ballon d'Or standings, nevertheless, after a sensational debut season in Spain which saw the 20-year-old burst onto the scene and bag 23 goals in 42 appearances.\n\nShould Bellingham inspire England to victory at this summer's European Championship, Vinicius may well need to do the same with Brazil at the Copa America to edge him out in the voting.\n\nHeading into the two tournaments, it promises to be an epic shootout between the two Madrid stars for this year's award, which could prove a regular occurrence over the next decade given both are in their early 20s.\n\nVinicius therefore has even more incentive to inspire Brazil to a first Copa America triumph for five years, making every one of his outings for Sele\u00e7\u00e3o a can't-miss event.\n\nHis Real Madrid teammate Jude Bellingham is running him close in the Ballon d'Or standings\n\nVinicius therefore has even more incentive to go all the way with Brazil over in the States\n\nMLS contingent\n\nIn a clear indication of the league's rise in quality, several MLS faces will be in action at this summer's tournament.\n\nMessi is of course representing Argentina, while his Miami teammates Luis Suarez (Uruguay), Matias Rojas (Paraguay) and Leo Campana (Ecuador) are also set to feature.\n\nThere are a total of 11 MLS names included in their nation's squads at the Copa America, with Orlando City also boasting four players at the competition.\n\nNorth America's top flight is well and truly on the up.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

While the Copa is traditionally contested by the 10 CONMEBOL teams, in 2024 it was decided to create an alliance that will help strengthen soccer ties across the continent, offering opportunities for the growth and exposure of soccer in the region, which is also preparing to host the World Cup in 2026.\n\nThe Copa Am\u00e9rica will be played in 14 cities across the United States in some of the best-known and most advanced stadiums that have staged other massive events such as the Super Bowl and will also be home to the next World Cup. Here are all the details about the tournament:\n\nThe inauguration of the Copa Am\u00e9rica will take place on June 20, 2024 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. No details of the event have been confirmed at this time, but since Colombian singer Shakira will perform a version of her song Punter\u00eda for the Copa, there are rumors that it will be the Colombian singer who will make a special presentation before the first match of the tournament, which will be played between reigning champion Argentina and Canada.\n\nThe tournament will feature 16 teams: the 10 nations that make up CONMEBOL, and six from CONCACAF. The CONCACAF teams were decided through the 2023-2024 CONCACAF Nations League, in which the United States won first place for the third time and left Mexico in second. Here are the teams that will compete in the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica in their respective groups:\n\nIn January 2023, it was announced that the United States would host the Copa Am\u00e9rica as part of a new strategic alliance between CONCACAF and CONMEBOL. A total of 14 cities will host the tournament, with three of them located in Texas (Arlington, Austin and Houston), two in California (Inglewood and Santa Clara), and two in Florida (Miami Gardens and Orlando).\n\nSome of the largest stadiums in the U.S. will be venues for Copa Am\u00e9rica 2024, including MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, which has been home to the Super Bowl and will also host fans from around the world during the 2026 World Cup. Below is the list of all the stadiums that will witness this championship along with their capacities. Although there will be large stadiums, there will also be smaller ones, such as Q2 Stadium in Texas or Children's Mercy Park in Kansas.", "source": {"uri": "english.elpais.com", "dataType": "news",

And if the U.S. Men's National Team is involved, then there's a guarantee of heightened interest.\n\nSuch is the case with Copa America odds.\n\nBut can the USMNT keep up with the tournament's top teams, all from South America?\n\n\"It would be a historic and unprecedented feat for the U.S. to win Copa America,\" FOX Sports soccer analyst Alexi Lalas said.\n\nStadiums across the United States will host the tournament, with all matches broadcast on either FOX, FS1 or FS2. Lalas, a former USMNT standout defender, serves up his insights on odds to win Copa America.\n\nA wager on the USMNT would pay out nicely if -- and it's a big if -- the American side makes an upstart run to the championship. A $100 wager would profit $1,400, for a $1,500 total payout.\n\nWorking in the Americans' favor is their draw into Group C. The U.S. opens June 23 against Bolivia, which is ranked a distant 85th in the world. Then on June 27, the USMNT meets Panama, ranked 45th.\n\nIf the U.S. wins both matches, as it's certainly expected to, then it would advance to the knockout stage, regardless of the result in the Group C finale vs. Uruguay on July 1. While Lalas is skeptical of a deep run, he's also got a dash of American optimism.\n\n\"The U.S. has gone to the semifinals in two of the four Copa Americas they have participated in,\" Lalas said, alluding to the 1995 and 2016 tournaments. \"The biggest strength of this team is the familiarity and connection that this group has been able to have. We have seen them grow from a talented group of teenage boys to experienced men.\n\n\"But it's time for them to prove that they are worthy of the praise they have been given.\"\n\nLeading that group is 25-year-old captain and midfielder Tyler Adams, and star forward Christian Pulisic, also 25. Lalas said Team USA has to turn its experience into confidence, then success, on the bigger stage.\n\n\"Their biggest weakness may be believing that they can do what hasn't been done before,\" he said.\n\nFavored Nations\n\nAs noted above, Argentina and Brazil are a close 1-2 in the Copa America odds market, with a little margin between those two and Uruguay. Argentina, ranked No. 1 in the world in the wake of its 2022 World Cup championship is the defending Copa America champion.\n\nIn the 2021 Copa final, Argentina beat Brazil 1-0 on the Brazilians' home turf in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nSoccer superstar Lionel Messi leads Argentina, which opens June 20 vs. Canada at Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Argentina then heads to MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., for a June 25 match vs. Chile.\n\nThen Messi, who now plays for Inter Miami in the MLS, gets a homecoming for Argentina's Group A finale vs. Peru, at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens. Hard Rock Stadium will also host the championship match July 14, and Lalas seems to like the Argentinian side's chances of reaching that match.\n\n\"Argentina is safe money, especially with Messi playing in his new backyard,\" Lalas said, alluding to one and potentially two matches in Miami. \"Brazil will want to spoil the party, despite many feeling that this particular Brazil team is more Brazil Lite. Vini Junior has an opportunity to lead a Neymar-less Brazil back to glory and shed the criticism that he can't translate his Real Madrid form to Brazil.\"\n\nAt +175, a $100 bet on Argentina to win Copa America would profit $175, for a total payout of $275. Brazil at +225 offers a little better wagering result, with a $100 bet profiting $225 for a $325 total payout.\n\nThen there's Uruguay, rightfully seen as a legitimate contender in Copa America futures odds. At +550, a $100 bet would profit $550, for a total payout of $650 if Uruguay lifts the trophy.\n\n\"Uruguay is not sneaky good, they are just good,\" Lalas said. \"Now, with [manager] Marcelo Bielsa at the helm, he might put it all together and justify the bullish feeling of so many.\"\n\nDark Horse\n\nIt's rare to term the fourth team on a 16-team odds board a dark horse. But with significant separation between the top three teams and the rest of the field, it's perhaps appropriate in this case.\n\nA $100 bet on Mexico would profit $1,300, for a $1,400 total payout if El Tri wins the tournament. Lalas wouldn't be entirely surprised if it happens.\n\n\"Mexico flipping the script and going on a run would be peak Mexico,\" he said. \"I can't think of a time when the El Tri fan base has been more pessimistic and down on the team. Copa miracle incoming!\"", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexi_Lalas", "type":

The tournament could mark the 36-year-old Messi's final act with the national team. It could also give the number 10 a final push towards the 2026 World Cup. The early rounds of South American World Cup qualifiers suggest Messi's international run could be extended, as Argentina tops the qualifying after six matches. But a good performance at Copa America could prove decisive for his future. Midfielder Mac Allister will have a good opportunity to show he has developed further as a player if he can keep Argentina moving when Messi's energy goes down during games. Striker Martinez will have another chance to show a good club season for him in Europe can translate into great form with the national team.\n\nKey players: Pedro Gallese, Luis Adv\u00edncula, Gianluca Lapadula\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Fossati became Peru coach in December with the team at the bottom of the 10-team round robin South American World Cup qualifying. A goalless draw with Paraguay at home on June 7, amid Copa America preparations, suggests not much has improved since. Nothing seems to work on a team that is still tied to veteran players, like goalkeeper Gallese, defender Advincula and striker Lapadula. And newcomers don't seem ready to challenge. Fossati will not start the tournament under pressure, but a first-round elimination in a tough group could make his life in the Peru job difficult very soon.\n\nKey players: Claudio Bravo, Alexis S\u00e1nchez, Ben Brereton\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Chile has struggled to leave its golden generation behind, and its Copa America squad shows it. Goalkeeper Bravo (41) and striker Sanchez (35) are sure to be among the key players on a team that has struggled to compete against fitter rivals in recent years. Defender Gary Medel (36) and midfielder Arturo Vidal (37) didn't make the cut but were not far from being included. Gareca, who took Peru to the World Cup in 2018, has yet to find a starting lineup since he joined in January. A recent 3-0 win against Paraguay gave new hope to the team ahead of the tournament, but it is unlikely Chile will find such weak opposition at the start of the group stage.\n\nKey players: Alphonso Davies, Tajon Buchanan, Jonathan David\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Jesse Marsch took over as team manager in mid-May after spending a year at the helm of Leeds United. He has already managed a couple of warm-up matches for Copa America, a 4-0 loss to the Netherlands and 0-0 draw against France. After a disappointing World Cup in Qatar, where the team lost all three of its matches, Canada Soccer is hoping Marsch can do better against tough competition in Copa America, including facing off against reigning world champion Argentina.\n\nKey players: Santiago Gim\u00e9nez, Juli\u00e1n Qui\u00f1ones, Edson \u00c1lvarez.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Jaime Lozano made a surprising move before Copa America by leaving off veterans Guillermo Ochoa, Raul Jim\u00e9nez, Hirving Lozano and Jesus Gallardo, as well as Henry Martin, because he is trying to give new players a chance to prove they can compete for a spot in the 2026 World Cup. So far, the experiment is not going well. Mexico lost 4-0 against Uruguay and 3-2 against Brazil in friendlies ahead of the tournament, leaving many pundits wondering if the move to go younger at this moment was right. As the friendly games have shown, Mexico is weak on defense. Besides Ochoa's absence, the team has lost projected starting goalkeeper Luis Malag\u00f3n to an injury. Carlos Acevedo, who was called to replace Malag\u00f3n, has looked impressive in practice since his arrival and could be a surprising starter.\n\nKey players: Piero Hincapi\u00e9, Enner Valencia, Moises Caicedo\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Ecuador remains one of the most competitive national teams in South America, much of it due to a generation of players that has been developed at local clubs Independiente del Valle and Liga de Quito. It is in fifth position in the regional World Cup qualifying despite starting with -3 points due to a penalty. But it has yet to show it can play well. Striker Valencia is struggling to score for the national team, and midfielder Caicedo has yet to show the pace he had prior to his move to Chelsea. The team's defense is set to be a strength, led by defender Hincapi\u00e9, who had a great season with German champions Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nKey players: Jeferson Soteldo, Yangel Herrera, Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Venezuela seems set to qualify for the World Cup for the first time, and its strengths are likely to show during Copa America. The team's top form, which includes an away draw at Brazil in World Cup qualifying, was built by coach Jos\u00e9 Pekerman, who left the job in March last year without providing any explanation. When many feared Venezuela would once again tank, Batista managed to keep the team's up front power and improve its transitions. Midfielder Soteldo is recovering from a right thigh injury, and his health could be decisive for the team's future in the tournament.\n\nKey players: Bobby Decordova-Reid, Shamar Nicholson and Cory Burke.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: The Reggae Boyz will appear in the South American tournament for the third time looking to break a six-game losing streak. Its first opponent, Mexico, could be the most difficult one, despite the absence of some key players. Jamaica will miss Aston Villa's Leon Bailey despite being included in the 26-man roster. Bailey's agent Craig Butler said that Bailey decided to take a break from the team. Coach Heimir Hallgr\u00edmsson has been with the team since 2022 and had good moments in the League of Nations, including a win over Canada that secured their spot in Copa America.\n\nKey players: Federico Valverde, Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Luis Su\u00e1rez\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Bielsa has begun a rebuilding process in Uruguay, but he can't give up on veteran players as he assembles his squad for the tournament. Striker N\u00fa\u00f1ez had a reasonable season at Liverpool, in which he scored 18 goals in 54 matches. He is expected to step up as 37-year-old Edinson Cavani retired from the national team. N\u00fa\u00f1ez will have to count on veteran Su\u00e1rez, playing his fifth Copa America, to help him up front. Uruguay beat Mexico 4-0 in a friendly early in June to suggest that any rival that does not respect its strikers will suffer. Midfielder Valverde will be the team's leader in the U.S.\n\nKey players: Christian Pulisic, John Sargent, Folarin Balogun\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: The U.S. has already proven to be the top team in CONCACAF after beating Mexico in the League of Nations final for the second year in a row. Copa America gives the Americans an opportunity to show they can give the South Americans trouble. The team lost 5-1 to Colombia, a nation that is riding a 22-game unbeaten streak, but then played a good match against Brazil, one of the top two contenders alongside Argentina. The U.S. team looks to be the favorite to move on to the second round with Uruguay, although Panama will be tough to beat. The problem for the Americans should they finish second behind Uruguay is there's a good chance they would meet Brazil in the quarterfinals.\n\nKey players: Michael Murillo, Adalberto Carrasquilla, Luis Mej\u00eda\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Under Thomas Christensen, the Panamanians have shown consistent progress even though they missed the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Christiansen remains at the helm despite that and last year the team was the runner-up in the Gold Cup and this year they made their way to the Nations League semifinals. Led by the Houston Dynamo's Adalberto Carrasquilla, the player of the tournament in last year's Gold Cup, Panama will try to upset the group favorites Uruguay and the United States. The team arrives at the tournament after securing a couple of victories in the CONCACAF qualifiers against Guyana and Montserrat. The 'Canaleros' will have a final warmup against Paraguay before facing Uruguay.\n\nKey players: Carlos Lampe, Gabriel Villamil, C\u00e9sar Menacho\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Bolivia has had a slow start under coach Zago, as its penultimate place in South American World Cup qualifying shows, but the team continues to field young players while looking to the future. Bolivia's hopes in Copa America lie in players who are more like 24-year-old striker Menacho, one of the top goal scorers of his country's national championship. A few veterans remain, including goalkeeper Lampe. The team will miss striker Marcelo Martins, who retired in March at age 36. Unlike most of its competitors, Bolivia's squad mostly includes local players.\n\nKey players: Vinicius J\u00fanior, Endrick and Lucas Paquet\u00e1\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: New coach, new starters and no Neymar. Brazil is likely to be competitive at Copa America as the team's performances in friendlies this year suggest, but it is hard to see J\u00fanior's team as heavy favorites. There are a few evident starters in goalkeeper Alisson, defender \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o, midfielder Paquet\u00e1 and winger J\u00fanior but that is about it. Teenager Endrick has delivered goals since he was first called up to the senior team in March, but Brazil's coach has not yet decided whether he or Rodrygo will start. Brazil's bench is filled with players getting their first opportunity with the national team.\n\nKey players: Jefferson Lerma, James Rodr\u00edguez, Luis D\u00edaz\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Unbeaten for 18 matches, Colombia is one of the favorites to win Copa America, something the team has not done in 23 years. Before beating the United States 5-1 amid preparations for the tournament, Colombia beat Brazil 2-1 in South American World Cup qualifying and topped both Spain and Germany in friendlies in Europe. Midfielder Rodr\u00edguez, who has struggled to play for his clubs in recent years, has delivered good performances for the national team. Colombia is in third place in World Cup qualifying, and a convincing campaign at Copa America could make its physical and skillful team aim higher in the next few years.\n\nKey players: Diego G\u00f3mez, Gustavo G\u00f3mez, Miguel Almir\u00f3n\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Paraguay will use Copa America and the Paris Olympics to try to secure a spot at the 2026 World Cup. Garnero is trying to rejuvenate his squad with the support of two key veterans: defender G\u00f3mez, one of the best on the continent since he arrived in Brazil's Palmeiras, and veteran striker Almir\u00f3n. The performances of 21-year-old midfielder G\u00f3mez of Inter Miami will be key for the Paraguayans to have any hopes of getting through the group. The tournament will also help the coach adjust his team to recover in World Cup qualifying, which currently sees Paraguay in 7th, out of the qualification zone.\n\nKey players: Francisco Calvo, Joel Campbell and Manfred Ugalde\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: After leading Ecuador to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, Alfaro became the Ticos' coach last November, replacing Luis Fernando Su\u00e1rez. Under Alfaro, the team is making a transition and several key players from the past are gone, including iconic goalkeeper Keylor Navas and veterans Celso Borges and Bryan Ruiz, leaving Joel Campbell and Francisco Calvo as the only veterans on the squad. Costa Rica has won its two World Cup qualifiers against Grenada and Saint Kitts and Nevis and had a 0-0 draw against Uruguay on May 31. Alfaro and his players know sharing the group with Brazil and Colombia, two of the contenders in the tournament, will not be an easy task, especially with a young team facing its first major test.\n\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.

It is the world's oldest still-running continental football competition. The competition determines the champion of South America. Since the 1990s, teams from Asia and North America have also been invited to play.\n\nThe event was first held in 1916 in honour of the 100th anniversary of Argentina's independence -- with Uruguay winning the inaugural title.\n\nIt took place every one to four years before it adopted its current quadrennial format in 2007. The Copa Am\u00e9rica is governed by the Confederaci\u00f3n Sudamericana de F\u00fatbol (commonly known as CONMEBOL), and the tournament's field consists of the 10 national teams that are members of CONMEBOL -- Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela -- plus two additional national teams that are invited to participate in the event.\n\nSince 1993, Copa America has featured 12 teams (all 10 CONMEBOL teams) plus two guest nations (the USA and Canada being the two in this edition). Mexico participated in every tournament between 1993 and 2016, with one additional team drawn from CONCACAF, except for 1999, when AFC team Japan filled out the 12-team roster, and 2019, which featured Japan and Qatar.\n\nOnly in the 2016 edition, which was the Copa America Centenario (100th anniversary), 16 teams featured - six teams from CONCACAF in addition to the 10 from CONMEBOL.\n\nTop three teams with most Copa America titles Team Number of titles won Years won Argentina 15 921 *, 1925 *, 1927, 1929 *, 1937 *, 1941, 1945, 1946 *, 1947, 1955, 1957, 1959 *, 1991,

The tournament could mark the 36-year-old Messi's final act with the national team. It could also give the number 10 a final push towards the 2026 World Cup. The early rounds of South American World Cup qualifiers suggest Messi's international run could be extended, as Argentina tops the qualifying after six matches. But a good performance at Copa America could prove decisive for his future. Midfielder Mac Allister will have a good opportunity to show he has developed further as a player if he can keep Argentina moving when Messi's energy goes down during games. Striker Martinez will have another chance to show a good club season for him in Europe can translate into great form with the national team.\n\nKey players: Pedro Gallese, Luis Adv\u00edncula, Gianluca Lapadula\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Fossati became Peru coach in December with the team at the bottom of the 10-team round robin South American World Cup qualifying. A goalless draw with Paraguay at home on June 7, amid Copa America preparations, suggests not much has improved since. Nothing seems to work on a team that is still tied to veteran players, like goalkeeper Gallese, defender Advincula and striker Lapadula. And newcomers don't seem ready to challenge. Fossati will not start the tournament under pressure, but a first-round elimination in a tough group could make his life in the Peru job difficult very soon.\n\nKey players: Claudio Bravo, Alexis S\u00e1nchez, Ben Brereton\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Chile has struggled to leave its golden generation behind, and its Copa America squad shows it. Goalkeeper Bravo (41) and striker Sanchez (35) are sure to be among the key players on a team that has struggled to compete against fitter rivals in recent years. Defender Gary Medel (36) and midfielder Arturo Vidal (37) didn't make the cut but were not far from being included. Gareca, who took Peru to the World Cup in 2018, has yet to find a starting lineup since he joined in January. A recent 3-0 win against Paraguay gave new hope to the team ahead of the tournament, but it is unlikely Chile will find such weak opposition at the start of the group stage.\n\nKey players: Alphonso Davies, Tajon Buchanan, Jonathan David\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Jesse Marsch took over as team manager in mid-May after spending a year at the helm of Leeds United. He has already managed a couple of warm-up matches for Copa America, a 4-0 loss to the Netherlands and 0-0 draw against France. After a disappointing World Cup in Qatar, where the team lost all three of its matches, Canada Soccer is hoping Marsch can do better against tough competition in Copa America, including facing off against reigning world champion Argentina.\n\nKey players: Santiago Gim\u00e9nez, Juli\u00e1n Qui\u00f1ones, Edson \u00c1lvarez.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Jaime Lozano made a surprising move before Copa America by leaving off veterans Guillermo Ochoa, Raul Jim\u00e9nez, Hirving Lozano and Jesus Gallardo, as well as Henry Martin, because he is trying to give new players a chance to prove they can compete for a spot in the 2026 World Cup. So far, the experiment is not going well. Mexico lost 4-0 against Uruguay and 3-2 against Brazil in friendlies ahead of the tournament, leaving many pundits wondering if the move to go younger at this moment was right. As the friendly games have shown, Mexico is weak on defense. Besides Ochoa's absence, the team has lost projected starting goalkeeper Luis Malag\u00f3n to an injury. Carlos Acevedo, who was called to replace Malag\u00f3n, has looked impressive in practice since his arrival and could be a surprising starter.\n\nKey players: Piero Hincapi\u00e9, Enner Valencia, Moises Caicedo\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Ecuador remains one of the most competitive national teams in South America, much of it due to a generation of players that has been developed at local clubs Independiente del Valle and Liga de Quito. It is in fifth position in the regional World Cup qualifying despite starting with -3 points due to a penalty. But it has yet to show it can play well. Striker Valencia is struggling to score for the national team, and midfielder Caicedo has yet to show the pace he had prior to his move to Chelsea. The team's defense is set to be a strength, led by defender Hincapi\u00e9, who had a great season with German champions Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nKey players: Jeferson Soteldo, Yangel Herrera, Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Venezuela seems set to qualify for the World Cup for the first time, and its strengths are likely to show during Copa America. The team's top form, which includes an away draw at Brazil in World Cup qualifying, was built by coach Jos\u00e9 Pekerman, who left the job in March last year without providing any explanation. When many feared Venezuela would once again tank, Batista managed to keep the team's up front power and improve its transitions. Midfielder Soteldo is recovering from a right thigh injury, and his health could be decisive for the team's future in the tournament.\n\nKey players: Bobby Decordova-Reid, Shamar Nicholson and Cory Burke.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: The Reggae Boyz will appear in the South American tournament for the third time looking to break a six-game losing streak. Its first opponent, Mexico, could be the most difficult one, despite the absence of some key players. Jamaica will miss Aston Villa's Leon Bailey despite being included in the 26-man roster. Bailey's agent Craig Butler said that Bailey decided to take a break from the team. Coach Heimir Hallgr\u00edmsson has been with the team since 2022 and had good moments in the League of Nations, including a win over Canada that secured their spot in Copa America.\n\nKey players: Federico Valverde, Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Luis Su\u00e1rez\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Bielsa has begun a rebuilding process in Uruguay, but he can't give up on veteran players as he assembles his squad for the tournament. Striker N\u00fa\u00f1ez had a reasonable season at Liverpool, in which he scored 18 goals in 54 matches. He is expected to step up as 37-year-old Edinson Cavani retired from the national team. N\u00fa\u00f1ez will have to count on veteran Su\u00e1rez, playing his fifth Copa America, to help him up front. Uruguay beat Mexico 4-0 in a friendly early in June to suggest that any rival that does not respect its strikers will suffer. Midfielder Valverde will be the team's leader in the U.S.\n\nKey players: Christian Pulisic, John Sargent, Folarin Balogun\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: The U.S. has already proven to be the top team in CONCACAF after beating Mexico in the League of Nations final for the second year in a row. Copa America gives the Americans an opportunity to show they can give the South Americans trouble. The team lost 5-1 to Colombia, a nation that is riding a 22-game unbeaten streak, but then played a good match against Brazil, one of the top two contenders alongside Argentina. The U.S. team looks to be the favorite to move on to the second round with Uruguay, although Panama will be tough to beat. The problem for the Americans should they finish second behind Uruguay is there's a good chance they would meet Brazil in the quarterfinals.\n\nKey players: Michael Murillo, Adalberto Carrasquilla, Luis Mej\u00eda\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Under Thomas Christensen, the Panamanians have shown consistent progress even though they missed the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Christiansen remains at the helm despite that and last year the team was the runner-up in the Gold Cup and this year they made their way to the Nations League semifinals. Led by the Houston Dynamo's Adalberto Carrasquilla, the player of the tournament in last year's Gold Cup, Panama will try to upset the group favorites Uruguay and the United States. The team arrives at the tournament after securing a couple of victories in the CONCACAF qualifiers against Guyana and Montserrat. The 'Canaleros' will have a final warmup against Paraguay before facing Uruguay.\n\nKey players: Carlos Lampe, Gabriel Villamil, C\u00e9sar Menacho\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Bolivia has had a slow start under coach Zago, as its penultimate place in South American World Cup qualifying shows, but the team continues to field young players while looking to the future. Bolivia's hopes in Copa America lie in players who are more like 24-year-old striker Menacho, one of the top goal scorers of his country's national championship. A few veterans remain, including goalkeeper Lampe. The team will miss striker Marcelo Martins, who retired in March at age 36. Unlike most of its competitors, Bolivia's squad mostly includes local players.\n\nKey players: Vinicius J\u00fanior, Endrick and Lucas Paquet\u00e1\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: New coach, new starters and no Neymar. Brazil is likely to be competitive at Copa America as the team's performances in friendlies this year suggest, but it is hard to see J\u00fanior's team as heavy favorites. There are a few evident starters in goalkeeper Alisson, defender \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o, midfielder Paquet\u00e1 and winger J\u00fanior but that is about it. Teenager Endrick has delivered goals since he was first called up to the senior team in March, but Brazil's coach has not yet decided whether he or Rodrygo will start. Brazil's bench is filled with players getting their first opportunity with the national team.\n\nKey players: Jefferson Lerma, James Rodr\u00edguez, Luis D\u00edaz\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Unbeaten for 18 matches, Colombia is one of the favorites to win Copa America, something the team has not done in 23 years. Before beating the United States 5-1 amid preparations for the tournament, Colombia beat Brazil 2-1 in South American World Cup qualifying and topped both Spain and Germany in friendlies in Europe. Midfielder Rodr\u00edguez, who has struggled to play for his clubs in recent years, has delivered good performances for the national team. Colombia is in third place in World Cup qualifying, and a convincing campaign at Copa America could make its physical and skillful team aim higher in the next few years.\n\nKey players: Diego G\u00f3mez, Gustavo G\u00f3mez, Miguel Almir\u00f3n\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Paraguay will use Copa America and the Paris Olympics to try to secure a spot at the 2026 World Cup. Garnero is trying to rejuvenate his squad with the support of two key veterans: defender G\u00f3mez, one of the best on the continent since he arrived in Brazil's Palmeiras, and veteran striker Almir\u00f3n. The performances of 21-year-old midfielder G\u00f3mez of Inter Miami will be key for the Paraguayans to have any hopes of getting through the group. The tournament will also help the coach adjust his team to recover in World Cup qualifying, which currently sees Paraguay in 7th, out of the qualification zone.\n\nKey players: Francisco Calvo, Joel Campbell and Manfred Ugalde\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: After leading Ecuador to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, Alfaro became the Ticos' coach last November, replacing Luis Fernando Su\u00e1rez. Under Alfaro, the team is making a transition and several key players from the past are gone, including iconic goalkeeper Keylor Navas and veterans Celso Borges and Bryan Ruiz, leaving Joel Campbell and Francisco Calvo as the only veterans on the squad. Costa Rica has won its two World Cup qualifiers against Grenada and Saint Kitts and Nevis and had a 0-0 draw against Uruguay on May 31. Alfaro and his players know sharing the group with Brazil and Colombia, two of the contenders in the tournament, will not be an easy task, especially with a young team facing its first major test.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

Argentina go to the United States for the Copa Am\u00e9rica as reigning champions, having ended their 28-year wait for glory when they beat Brazil in the final in 2021. They followed that up by winning the World Cup in 2022, as Lionel Messi lifted the one trophy that had been missing from his vast collection.\n\nArgentina are the favourites to win the Copa Am\u00e9rica again this year, according to the Opta supercomputer, with Brazil not far behind. Opta have simulated the tournament 10,000 times and collated their findings to construct pre-tournament predictions.\n\nThe holders are not always the favourites before major international tournaments - Italy were not well fancied before Euro 2024. But Argentina are the world's best team, according to the current Fifa rankings, and it's not hard to see why. They are stacked with talent. Supporting Messi in attack are \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, who will retire from international football after the tournament, Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez and Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, while Alejandro Garnacho, Nicol\u00e1s Gonz\u00e1lez and \u00c1ngel Correa are not bad options either. Paulo Dybala has not made the squad, such is the quality at Lionel Scaloni's disposal.\n\nEnzo Fern\u00e1ndez and Alexis Mac Allister are excellent midfielders, with Rodrigo De Paul bringing some flair to go with his bite. Emiliano Mart\u00ednez is one of the best goalkeepers in world football. He thrives in the big moments and enjoys the pressure, as demonstrated in penalty shootouts at the last Copa Am\u00e9rica and World Cup. According to Opta's model, he conceded eight fewer goals than anticipated based on the quality of shots he faced in the Premier League this season.\n\nArgentina have a 30.8% chance of winning the tournament and a whopping 50.5% likelihood of making the final. Their side of the draw looks kind, with Mexico and Chile the teams most likely to cause them a threat.\n\nThis will almost certainly be Messi's last Copa Am\u00e9rica. At the previous tournament in 2021, he finished as the joint-top scorer and also provided five assists. He will overtake Chilean great Sergio Livingstone for all-time appearances in the competition this year - they are currently tied on 34. Messi could also match or surpass record scorers Noberto M\u00e9ndez and Zizinho (17 goals each). He has 13 as it stands.\n\nThe Argentina captain will be ably supported. Lautaro Mart\u00ednez finished top of the Serie A scoring charts and led Inter to the Scudetto. \u00c1lvarez contributed to 32 goals for Manchester City (19 goals, 13 assists) this season. And Di Mar\u00eda scored nine times in Portugal's top flight for Benfica this season, also setting up 10 goals and creating more chances (80) than any other player in the league.\n\nArgentina, who have played more matches (201) and scored more goals in the Copa (474) than any other team, have it all. They just need to put it together again to complete an era of dominance under Scaloni.\n\nBrazil coach Dorival J\u00fanior was pretty ruthless in his selection process. Gabriel Jesus has missed out, even though he was fit by the end of the season. Casemiro has been cut due to his poor form for Manchester United. Richarlison and Neymar are injured, but Brazil still have plenty of talent. Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, fresh from scoring in the Champions League final, is their leading light. He scored 24 goals for Real Madrid this season and attempted 286 dribbles - more than any other player in Europe's top five leagues.\n\nEndrick is a superstar in the making. The 17-year-old, who will be linking up with Vin\u00edcius at Real Madrid next season, has taken the No 9 shirt for this tournament. After his brilliant header - from a Vin\u00edcius cross - against Mexico this month, Endrick has scored three goals for the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o in just five appearances. Those goals came in three consecutive matches; the last player to hit the net in four successive games for Brazil was Neymar in June 2021.\n\nThis Brazil team perhaps lacks the magic of previous sides, but they have a streetfighter steel, with Lucas Paquet\u00e1, Bruno Guimar\u00e3es and Douglas Luiz in midfield. If Brazil top their group, which includes Colombia, Paraguay and Costa Rica, they will not meet Argentina until the final, should both teams make it that far.\n\nUruguay, Argentina and Brazil have won the Copa Am\u00e9rica 39 times between them - 83% of the tournaments. Marcelo Bielsa's team, who will be appearing at the tournament for the 46th time, should be considered as more than just dark horses. They thrashed Mexico 4-0 in a pre-tournament friendly last week, and they have already beaten Argentina and Brazil in World Cup qualifying - they are second in the 10-team group, behind Argentina.\n\nLuis Su\u00e1rez, the country's record goalscorer (68 goals in 138 caps) is in the squad and comes into the tournament in fine form, having scored 12 goals in MLS this season, averaging one every 96 minutes for Miami, where he dovetails brilliantly with his old friend Messi. Su\u00e1rez's goals have come from an xG of 7.9 - an impressive overperformance of 4.1.\n\nThere are plenty of goals in the team. Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez scored a hat-trick in that 4-0 victory over Mexico and is the top scorer in the World Cup qualifying group, with five. Federico Valverde is one of the world's best all-round midfielders, while Ronald Araujo and Jos\u00e9 Gim\u00e9nez form a fearsome centre-back pairing. Flamengo's Nicol\u00e1s de la Cruz could shine, and Manuel Ugarte and Rodrigo Bentancur are also excellent. Uruguay will likely have to beat Brazil at some stage if they are to reach the final, but Bielsa's side will have no fear.\n\nThe hosts are fourth favourites according to the Opta supercomputer, but their chances are slim. Gregg Berhalter's squad has plenty of potential - securing Folarin Balogun's allegiance was something of a coup, though he has not had the greatest of seasons for Monaco.\n\nUSA captain Christian Pulisic has thrived at Milan, but he can't do it all on his own. Timothy Weah, Weston McKennie, Tyler Adams and Yunus Musah all have plenty of top-flight experience, and Haji Wright had an excellent season for Coventry City in the Championship, but the USA have lost three of their last five matches, including a 5-1 hammering at the hands of a rampant Colombia at the weekend.\n\nTwo years before hosting the World Cup, USA are under pressure to perform. The hosts should get out of the group, probably behind Uruguay, but Panama will be no pushovers, even if Bolivia look weak.\n\nColombia are the form team in South America - they are unbeaten in a whopping 22 matches, a run that dates back to March 2022, even though they did not qualify for the World Cup that year. Their vibrant fans were missed in Qatar and, having reached the semi-finals at the last Copa Am\u00e9rica in 2021, they will hope their side is ready to pop on the big stage again, 23 years after their sole triumph in the competition.\n\nLuis D\u00edaz was top scorer at the last Copa with four goals, including some stunners. James Rodr\u00edguez is reaching the twilight of his career, but the former Real Madrid playmaker has been in sensational form for his country under N\u00e9stor Lorenzo, who has Colombia in a strong position to qualify for the next World Cup - they are third in the South American standings.\n\nBolivia have won the Copa Am\u00e9rica only once, as hosts in 1963. The Opta supercomputer does not fancy their chances of ending that run; they have the lowest chance of victory of all teams.\n\nIt doesn't fancy Jamaica either. Their best player - the Aston Villa forward Leon Bailey - will not be playing at this tournament following disparaging comments he made about the national team this year. Demarai Gray, Michail Antonio and Bobby De Cordova-Reid bring Premier League experience, but none of them possesses Bailey's quality. Jamaica are in a group with Mexico, Venezuela and Ecuador, so have a decent chance of making the last eight, though not much hope of progressing beyond that.\n\nPanama reached the Concacaf Gold Cup final last year, but are unlikely to repeat that feat this year. The same goes for Paraguay, Venezuela, Peru, Costa Rica and Canada - Alphonso Davies and Jonathan David are excellent players, but unlikely to be enough to drag Jesse Marsch's team to an unlikely triumph, though they did draw 0-0 with France to recover some confidence after a heavy defeat to the Netherlands.\n\nChile won back-to-back Copas in 2015 and 2016 - and Alexis S\u00e1nchez, Arturo Vidal and Eduardo Vargas (one of the top all-time leading goalscorers in the tournament, with 14) are still in their ranks - but they are unlikely to lift the trophy for a third time. They do, though, have a decent chance of making it out of Group A alongside Argentina.\n\nEcuador have a promising squad, with Mois\u00e9s Caicedo the pick of the bunch, though they are still heavily reliant on Enner Valencia for goals. Mexico's recent defeats to Brazil and Uruguay suggest they could be a big-name casualty. If they progress from their group, they will probably have to get past Argentina to reach the final.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [],

The tournament could mark the 36-year-old Messi's final act with the national team. It could also give the number 10 a final push towards the 2026 World Cup. The early rounds of South American World Cup qualifiers suggest Messi's international run could be extended, as Argentina tops the qualifying after six matches. But a good performance at Copa America could prove decisive for his future. Midfielder Mac Allister will have a good opportunity to show he has developed further as a player if he can keep Argentina moving when Messi's energy goes down during games. Striker Martinez will have another chance to show a good club season for him in Europe can translate into great form with the national team.\n\nPeru\n\nBest finish: titles in 1939 and 1975\n\nCoach: Jorge Fossati\n\nKey players: Pedro Gallese, Luis Adv\u00edncula, Gianluca Lapadula\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Fossati became Peru coach in December with the team at the bottom of the 10-team round robin South American World Cup qualifying. A goalless draw with Paraguay at home on June 7, amid Copa America preparations, suggests not much has improved since. Nothing seems to work on a team that is still tied to veteran players, like goalkeeper Gallese, defender Advincula and striker Lapadula. And newcomers don't seem ready to challenge. Fossati will not start the tournament under pressure, but a first-round elimination in a tough group could make his life in the Peru job difficult very soon.\n\nChile\n\nBest finish: titles in 2015 and 2016\n\nCoach: Ricardo Gareca\n\nKey players: Claudio Bravo, Alexis S\u00e1nchez, Ben Brereton\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Chile has struggled to leave its golden generation behind, and its Copa America squad shows it. Goalkeeper Bravo (41) and striker Sanchez (35) are sure to be among the key players on a team that has struggled to compete against fitter rivals in recent years. Defender Gary Medel (36) and midfielder Arturo Vidal (37) didn't make the cut but were not far from being included. Gareca, who took Peru to the World Cup in 2018, has yet to find a starting lineup since he joined in January. A recent 3-0 win against Paraguay gave new hope to the team ahead of the tournament, but it is unlikely Chile will find such weak opposition at the start of the group stage.\n\nCanada\n\nBest finish: Will make its debut\n\nCoach: Jesse Marsch\n\nKey players: Alphonso Davies, Tajon Buchanan, Jonathan David\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Jesse Marsch took over as team manager in mid-May after spending a year at the helm of Leeds United. He has already managed a couple of warm-up matches for Copa America, a 4-0 loss to the Netherlands and 0-0 draw against France. After a disappointing World Cup in Qatar, where the team lost all three of its matches, Canada Soccer is hoping Marsch can do better against tough competition in Copa America, including facing off against reigning world champion Argentina.\n\nGROUP B\n\nMexico\n\nBest finish: Runner up in 1993 and 2001\n\nKey players: Santiago Gim\u00e9nez, Juli\u00e1n Qui\u00f1ones, Edson \u00c1lvarez.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Jaime Lozano made a surprising move before Copa America by leaving off veterans Guillermo Ochoa, Raul Jim\u00e9nez, Hirving Lozano and Jesus Gallardo, as well as Henry Martin, because he is trying to give new players a chance to prove they can compete for a spot in the 2026 World Cup. So far, the experiment is not going well. Mexico lost 4-0 against Uruguay and 3-2 against Brazil in friendlies ahead of the tournament, leaving many pundits wondering if the move to go younger at this moment was right. As the friendly games have shown, Mexico is weak on defense. Besides Ochoa's absence, the team has lost projected starting goalkeeper Luis Malag\u00f3n to an injury. Carlos Acevedo, who was called to replace Malag\u00f3n, has looked impressive in practice since his arrival and could be a surprising starter.\n\nEcuador\n\nBest finish: fourth place in 1959 2nd edition and 1993\n\nCoach: F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez Bas\n\nKey players: Piero Hincapi\u00e9, Enner Valencia, Moises Caicedo\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Ecuador remains one of the most competitive national teams in South America, much of it due to a generation of players that has been developed at local clubs Independiente del Valle and Liga de Quito. It is in fifth position in the regional World Cup qualifying despite starting with -3 points due to a penalty. But it has yet to show it can play well. Striker Valencia is struggling to score for the national team, and midfielder Caicedo has yet to show the pace he had prior to his move to Chelsea. The team's defense is set to be a strength, led by defender Hincapi\u00e9, who had a great season with German champions Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nVenezuela\n\nBest finish: fourth place in 2011\n\nCoach: Fernando Batista\n\nKey players: Jeferson Soteldo, Yangel Herrera, Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Venezuela seems set to qualify for the World Cup for the first time, and its strengths are likely to show during Copa America. The team's top form, which includes an away draw at Brazil in World Cup qualifying, was built by coach Jos\u00e9 Pekerman, who left the job in March last year without providing any explanation. When many feared Venezuela would once again tank, Batista managed to keep the team's up front power and improve its transitions. Midfielder Soteldo is recovering from a right thigh injury, and his health could be decisive for the team's future in the tournament.\n\nJamaica\n\nBest finish: Last place in group stage (2015 and 2016)\n\nCoach: Heimir Hallgr\u00edmsson\n\nKey players: Bobby Decordova-Reid, Shamar Nicholson and Cory Burke.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: The Reggae Boyz will appear in the South American tournament for the third time looking to break a six-game losing streak. Its first opponent, Mexico, could be the most difficult one, despite the absence of some key players. Jamaica will miss Aston Villa's Leon Bailey despite being included in the 26-man roster. Bailey's agent Craig Butler said that Bailey decided to take a break from the team. Coach Heimir Hallgr\u00edmsson has been with the team since 2022 and had good moments in the League of Nations, including a win over Canada that secured their spot in Copa America.\n\nGROUP C:\n\nUruguay\n\nBest finish: titles in 1916, 1917, 1920, 1923, 1924, 1926, 1935, 1942, 1956, 1959 2nd edition, 1967, 1983, 1995, and 2011.\n\nCoach: Marcelo Bielsa\n\nKey players: Federico Valverde, Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Luis Su\u00e1rez\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Bielsa has begun a rebuilding process in Uruguay, but he can't give up on veteran players as he assembles his squad for the tournament. Striker N\u00fa\u00f1ez had a reasonable season at Liverpool, in which he scored 18 goals in 54 matches. He is expected to step up as 37-year-old Edinson Cavani retired from the national team. N\u00fa\u00f1ez will have to count on veteran Su\u00e1rez, playing his fifth Copa America, to help him up front. Uruguay beat Mexico 4-0 in a friendly early in June to suggest that any rival that does not respect its strikers will suffer. Midfielder Valverde will be the team's leader in the U.S.\n\nUnited States\n\nBest finish: Fourth place in 1995 and 2016\n\nCoach: Gregg Berhalter\n\nKey players: Christian Pulisic, John Sargent, Folarin Balogun\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: The U.S. has already proven to be the top team in CONCACAF after beating Mexico in the League of Nations final for the second year in a row. Copa America gives the Americans an opportunity to show they can give the South Americans trouble. The team lost 5-1 to Colombia, a nation that is riding a 22-game unbeaten streak, but then played a good match against Brazil, one of the top two contenders alongside Argentina. The U.S. team looks to be the favorite to move on to the second round with Uruguay, although Panama will be tough to beat. The problem for the Americans should they finish second behind Uruguay is there's a good chance they would meet Brazil in the quarterfinals.\n\nPanam\u00e1\n\nBest finish: First round 2016\n\nCoach: Thomas Christiansen\n\nKey players: Michael Murillo, Adalberto Carrasquilla, Luis Mej\u00eda\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Under Thomas Christensen, the Panamanians have shown consistent progress even though they missed the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Christiansen remains at the helm despite that and last year the team was the runner-up in the Gold Cup and this year they made their way to the Nations League semifinals. Led by the Houston Dynamo's Adalberto Carrasquilla, the player of the tournament in last year's Gold Cup, Panama will try to upset the group favorites Uruguay and the United States. The team arrives at the tournament after securing a couple of victories in the CONCACAF qualifiers against Guyana and Montserrat. The 'Canaleros' will have a final warmup against Paraguay before facing Uruguay.\n\nBolivia\n\nBest finish: title in 1963\n\nCoach: Antonio Carlos Zago\n\nKey players: Carlos Lampe, Gabriel Villamil, C\u00e9sar Menacho\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Bolivia has had a slow start under coach Zago, as its penultimate place in South American World Cup qualifying shows, but the team continues to field young players while looking to the future. Bolivia's hopes in Copa America lie in players who are more like 24-year-old striker Menacho, one of the top goal scorers of his country's national championship. A few veterans remain, including goalkeeper Lampe. The team will miss striker Marcelo Martins, who retired in March at age 36. Unlike most of its competitors, Bolivia's squad mostly includes local players.\n\nGROUP D\n\nBrazil\n\nBest finish: title in 1919, 1922, 1949, 1989, 1997, 1999, 2004, 2007, and 2019.\n\nCoach: Dorival J\u00fanior\n\nKey players: Vinicius J\u00fanior, Endrick and Lucas Paquet\u00e1\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: New coach, new starters and no Neymar. Brazil is likely to be competitive at Copa America as the team's performances in friendlies this year suggest, but it is hard to see J\u00fanior's team as heavy favorites. There are a few evident starters in goalkeeper Alisson, defender \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o, midfielder Paquet\u00e1 and winger J\u00fanior but that is about it. Teenager Endrick has delivered goals since he was first called up to the senior team in March, but Brazil's coach has not yet decided whether he or Rodrygo will start. Brazil's bench is filled with players getting their first opportunity with the national team.\n\nColombia\n\nBest finish: title in 2001\n\nCoach: N\u00e9stor Lorenzo\n\nKey players: Jefferson Lerma, James Rodr\u00edguez, Luis D\u00edaz\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Unbeaten for 18 matches, Colombia is one of the favorites to win Copa America, something the team has not done in 23 years. Before beating the United States 5-1 amid preparations for the tournament, Colombia beat Brazil 2-1 in South American World Cup qualifying and topped both Spain and Germany in friendlies in Europe. Midfielder Rodr\u00edguez, who has struggled to play for his clubs in recent years, has delivered good performances for the national team. Colombia is in third place in World Cup qualifying, and a convincing campaign at Copa America could make its physical and skillful team aim higher in the next few years.\n\nParaguay\n\nBest finish: titles in 1953 and 1979\n\nCoach: Daniel Garnero\n\nKey players: Diego G\u00f3mez, Gustavo G\u00f3mez, Miguel Almir\u00f3n\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Paraguay will use Copa America and the Paris Olympics to try to secure a spot at the 2026 World Cup. Garnero is trying to rejuvenate his squad with the support of two key veterans: defender G\u00f3mez, one of the best on the continent since he arrived in Brazil's Palmeiras, and veteran striker Almir\u00f3n. The performances of 21-year-old midfielder G\u00f3mez of Inter Miami will be key for the Paraguayans to have any hopes of getting through the group. The tournament will also help the coach adjust his team to recover in World Cup qualifying, which currently sees Paraguay in 7th, out of the qualification zone.\n\nCosta Rica\n\nBest finish: quarterfinals in 2004\n\nCoach: Gustavo Alfaro\n\nKey players: Francisco Calvo, Joel Campbell and Manfred Ugalde\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: After leading Ecuador to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, Alfaro became the Ticos' coach last November, replacing Luis Fernando Su\u00e1rez. Under Alfaro, the team is making a transition and several key players from the past are gone, including iconic goalkeeper Keylor Navas and veterans Celso Borges and Bryan Ruiz, leaving Joel Campbell and Francisco Calvo as the only veterans on the squad. Costa Rica has won its two World Cup qualifiers against Grenada and Saint Kitts and Nevis and had a 0-0 draw against Uruguay on May 31. Alfaro and his players know sharing the group with Brazil and Colombia, two of the contenders in the tournament, will not be an easy task, especially with a young team facing its first major test.\n\nAP Copa America coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/copa-america", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It will stretch from coast to coast, capturing TV audiences throughout the Americas. It will feature megastars, like Lionel Messi, plus a vibrant array of Latino flair.\n\nOne of its core questions, though, is: Will casual fans in the host country care?\n\nMillions of Mexican Americans and Colombian Americans, of Argentine Americans and Venezuelan Americans, will joyously erupt for the Copa Am\u00e9rica. This, many of them know, is arguably the most competitive men's international soccer tournament in the four-year interim between World Cups.\n\nBut the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica, specifically, is a novelty in a country mostly unfamiliar with it.\n\nHere, then, is an attempt to familiarize you -- with the basics, the narratives, the problems, and the driving forces behind this one-of-a-kind event.\n\nCopa Am\u00e9rica is the South American men's soccer championship, a century-old competition among the continent's 10 national teams (and often others).\n\nIts cadence, size and format have varied over the years. Now, it's a quadrennial tournament much like the European Championship (Euros), played in even-year summers between men's World Cups.\n\nIt typically features 12 teams, with two invited from other continents. But in 2024, it will temporarily expand to 16. More on that below.\n\nIn South America, perhaps the planet's most soccer-crazed continent, it's a massive deal. It's historic, prestigious, anticipated, fiercely contested and festive. For years, it was massive enough to .\n\nOutside the Americas, it's a bit less so. Its global footprint is dwarfed by its European equivalent, the Euros. That, however, is largely due to western Europe's economic might -- and its willingness/eagerness to commercialize and market the sport.\n\nAt their core, the two tournaments are comparable. They're soccer's biggest outside the World Cup -- the toughest to win, the most lucrative, the most acclaimed. And this year's Copa Am\u00e9rica, in some ways, is even bigger.\n\nStruggling to find a satisfactory South American host, CONMEBOL -- the 10-member South American soccer confederation -- , its North and Central American counterpart.\n\nCONCACAF would help organize the 2024 edition in the United States; in return, it would get six spots in a 16-team field.\n\nCopa Am\u00e9rica hosting duties typically rotate from one South American nation to the next -- from 1989-2011, for example, each of CONMEBOL's 10 members hosted once.\n\nIn recent years, though, the COVID-19 pandemic and instability have disrupted the rotation, and left organizers scrambling for stand-ins -- first Brazil, and now the U.S.\n\nIn 2024, it was supposed to be Ecuador's turn. But Ecuador, citing security and infrastructure concerns, relinquished the responsibility. \"We're not ready to organize the Copa Am\u00e9rica,\" Francisco Egas, the president of its soccer federation, said in November 2022. So, with less than two years to go, CONMEBOL did not know where its 2024 championship would be played.\n\nBrazil, its biggest, richest and most capable deputy, seemed willing and able to host. But Brazil had also hosted the previous two Copa Am\u00e9ricas -- first in 2019, in line with the standard rotation; and then in 2021 when Colombia and Argentina pulled out last-minute.\n\nSo, pushed by necessity but also pulled by financial and political benefits, CONMEBOL leaders turned to the States. Conversations accelerated at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. An agreement was reached and announced in early 2023.\n\nYep, but that one was even more novel. It was a one-off \"Centenario\" edition in 2016. It was not moved to the U.S.; rather, it was essentially created by the U.S. Soccer Federation, in partnership with CONMEBOL, one year after the regularly scheduled 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica, as a cash-grab and opportunity to pit the U.S. men's national team against elite opponents.\n\nPractically, though, the 2016 and 2024 tournaments will be very similar. Same format; six of the same host cities; 15 of the same 16 teams.\n\nIt was fairly successful. On the field, Chile beat Argentina in a glamorous but brutal final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. In the stands, 1.48 million tickets were sold, an average of roughly 46,000 per game. In total, the event generated a \"one-off profit of around $80 million\" for U.S. Soccer, its then-vice president, Carlos Cordeiro, .\n\nThat's a complicated question.\n\nIn South America, fans always get excited about any Copa Am\u00e9rica, but some are unhappy that their crown jewel has been shipped off to North America again.\n\nIn North America, those who understand the gravity and importance of the tournament seem excited; but many non-Latinos in and around the American soccer community feel that the tournament has been poorly promoted and might fail to break through a crowded U.S. sports scene.\n\nCONMEBOL's commercial chief, Juan Emilio Roa, told Yahoo Sports that an estimated 25-30% of match-going fans would be ones traveling from South America; most of the rest will be U.S. residents.\n\nRoa told Yahoo Sports on June 7 that just over 1 million tickets had been sold -- a little more than 31,000 per game. That's around 50% of capacity across all games, most of which will be played at NFL stadiums.\n\nNaturally, matches featuring teams like Argentina and Mexico are close to or already sold-out; others, though, could be pretty empty.\n\nBy , finding your desired stadium or game, and paying handsomely.\n\nOne reason that roughly 50% of tickets remain unclaimed is that the prices, to many, are obscene. A single upper-deck ticket for Argentina's opener against Canada, in the second-to-last row of Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, costs $307 at the time of writing. Even for Peru-Chile at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, the following day, a standard 200-level ticket costs $208. The average tournament-wide ticket price, according to Vivid Seats, is $283.\n\nIt's unclear who, exactly, is to blame for the obscene prices.\n\nRoa confirmed that they are based on the \"dynamic pricing\" model often utilized by American ticket brokers such as Ticketmaster and SeatGeek.\n\nFor a standard Copa Am\u00e9rica in South America, CONMEBOL would have complete control over all aspects of the matchday experience, including ticketing. But here, they have had to work with a variety of interested (and capitalistic) parties stadium-by-stadium, city-by-city. Rather than sell tickets on a single platform, they have essentially delegated that task to each venue -- some of which use Ticketmaster, some of which use SeatGeek.\n\nThe complexities, and the somewhat last-minute nature of all these arrangements, have been challenges, and presumably reasons that tickets did not go on sale until late February.\n\nThey're scattered across the U.S., in 14 different cities, with each hosting no more than three games.\n\nThe . A .\n\nSome games, certainly in the knockout rounds, should be great. Others, between prideful but less-prominent teams stuck in cavernous NFL stadiums, will feel a bit soulless.\n\nThe tournament as a whole will probably struggle to differentiate itself from all the other high-level soccer being played in the United States this decade. But for CONMEBOL, financially, it will almost surely be successful.\n\n\"The North American market is an amazing market, in terms of everything -- in terms of viewerships, in terms of sponsorship, in terms of exposure,\" Roa said. The inclusion of Mexico's national team has likely allowed CONMEBOL to tap into many millions more dollars.\n\n\"And for sure, having Argentina and Leo Messi play in this Copa America ... increased the interest around the world,\" Roa added.\n\n\"We received calls and emails and contacts through our [commercial] agency, directly to CONMEBOL, from all around the world, como nunca antes, like never before,\" Roa said. \"Because, obviously, they have interests in the States. And all the things that happen in the States -- it takes another dimension.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

I think this tournament falls kindly for Argentina to navigate to the final. There, no matter the opponent, I think Messi and Co. win a third consecutive international tournament in his new home city.\n\nFelipe Cardenas: Argentina's quest for greatness has defined this Messi-led group of players. Argentina will have learned plenty from the 2022 World Cup. They took a haymaker in their opening match against Saudi Arabia and got back up. Argentina won a quarterfinal penalty shootout and leaned on multiple players other than Messi to triumph in a tournament setting. The defending champions are battle-tested and very talented.\n\nJeff Rueter: Although the United States is the host, doesn't this still feel like Argentina's tournament above all else? Like their talisman, the federation has set up firm roots in Miami over the past couple of years. In what might be Messi's swansong, La Albiceleste should replicate Spain's feat at the turn of the 2010s: continental title, World Cup, continental title.\n\nMelanie Anzidei: Winning a second Copa America in a row would solidify Argentina's place as one of football's greatest teams. This is not the same team that played on American soil in 2016. Far from it. This team is led by a captain who has once again found joy in playing and who has an entire nation behind him. Winning this tournament is personal for La Scaloneta, and I think we'll see that starting Thursday.\n\nJoshua Kloke: Brazil might be a younger team but without the pressure that comes with World Cups, and the expectations Argentina clearly has on them (see the pack of picks above!) I could see Brazil's talent taking over. If they can play liberated -- which can admittedly be a challenge for Brazil -- they should make their way through the tougher side of the draw and win their second Copa America title in the last three tournaments.\n\nThom Harris: Argentina are the sensible choice, but I'm going to be bold and say Uruguay.\n\nThey have been a joy to watch under Marcelo Bielsa so far, scoring the most goals in World Cup qualifying, beating both Argentina and Brazil, before smashing four past Mexico in a pre-tournament friendly. Their roster is not only brimming with quality, but the kind of unstoppable athleticism that Bielsa needs to implement his man-to-man marking system, able to both disrupt the opposition with aggressive defensive play and launch lethal counter-attacks.\n\nWith both nations tied on a record 15 Copa America titles each, I've got my fingers crossed for a meeting in the final.\n\nTenorio: Tough to go into a tournament predicting it will be anyone other than Messi. He is in good form and he will get his opportunities to score and change games.\n\nCardenas: Luis Diaz scored four goals at the 2021 Copa America, leading Colombia to the semifinals. Messi will take home the player of the tournament trophy, but Diaz will solidify his place as one of the sport's best attacking players. Now 27, Diaz is hitting his peak. He'll be a joy to watch this summer.\n\nRueter: It's Messi like everything is these days, but Vinicius Jr will lead Brazil to a berth in the final and make a challenge for the golden ball in the process.\n\nAnzidei: The obvious answer is Messi. Even when he doesn't want to be up there on the podium, he receives the honor again and again. But something about him giving the penalty kick to Lautaro Martinez during Argentina's friendly against Guatemala last week makes me feel like the Inter forward will have a surprise showing this tournament.\n\nKloke: Brazil is Vinicius Jr's team now and it feels entirely possible that he uses up all the runway afforded to him and takes flight this tournament.\n\nHarris: I'm going to be bold again... James Rodriguez. Colombia have been in exceptional form under Nestor Lorenzo, unbeaten in over two years, and the 32-year-old has been central to his success. Given freedom to roam in behind the two forward players, he can drop deep to help with the build-up, but also pack a punch in the final third.\n\nTenorio: My gut feeling is the U.S. will bow out in the quarterfinals to Brazil after coming second in a tight finish for the top spot in the group with Uruguay.\n\nCardenas: After the Copa America draw, I picked the U.S. to reach the semifinals. That's a bare minimum requirement for the host nation. However, after being thrashed by Colombia 5-1 in a June friendly, I have serious doubts about the USMNT's ability to win a knockout game at this Copa America. Berhalter's side will bow out in the quarterfinals.\n\nRueter: A step behind their 2016 showing: second in Group C behind Uruguay (six points), then a cagey 2-1 defeat in the quarterfinal against Group D winner Colombia.\n\nAnzidei: I'd like to believe the U.S. will surprise us all and push through to the semifinals once again, but that's only if they finish at the top of Group C. If they are the runner-up in their group, which is more likely, I don't see them ousting Colombia or Brazil in the second round.\n\nKloke: Finishing third in a difficult Group A, which would include a confidence-building win, feels likely for Canada. Running until their legs give way against Chile for a result in their final game should inspire some fans back home, but it might not be enough to get a still-developing team into the knockout stage.\n\nTenorio: Yaser Asprilla. My Colombian colleague Felipe Cardenas wrote on The Radar that the 20-year-old is the Colombian Phil Foden. High praise. He plays in England (for second-tier side Watford) already and has been very good in a short amount of time for Colombia. If he can do it on this Copa America stage, even coming off the bench, that's a recipe for a big transfer fee.\n\nCardenas: Asprilla is a great shout by Paul. I don't know how much he'll play though. I'm going to choose Ecuador's Piero Hincapie. His profile is rising after helping Bayer Leverkusen to an undefeated season in the Bundesliga. He's an athletic ball-playing center back who is also left footed. That's a coveted profile at the highest level. If he plays well for Ecuador, Hincapie could make a move to the Premier League.\n\nRueter: We at The Athletic have all fallen hard for Dario Osorio in 2024, and the Chilean winger seems poised to be Alexis Sanchez's heir apparent. He's played just one season with FC Midtjylland in Denmark, but the 20-year-old could be poised to make the leap to an even higher level.\n\nAnzidei: I'm also excited to see how Osorio will do, as one of the young stars on Chile's largely veteran squad. And I'll be paying close attention to 23-year-old Santiago Gimenez, the Argentinean-born Mexican forward. He's made a name for himself already for Feyenoord, and a breakout performance on the international stage will draw even more eyes on the rising talent.\n\nKloke: We know Jonathan David is finally going to move on from Lille this summer after being Europe's next great striker for years now. But whether he goes to the Premier League or elsewhere remains up for debate. Snagging a few key goals for Canada, especially if one of those goals comes against Argentina, could boost his profile and land him at the kind of upper-echelon club he wants to play for.\n\nHarris: Osorio. He has been having his own goal-of-the-season competition in Denmark this year and one more flash of quality will have the biggest clubs on high alert.\n\nCardenas: The Copa America is such an important tournament for South American countries. I'm very intrigued to see how it plays out in the U.S.. The 2016 edition seems like a distant memory. There wasn't a North American World Cup on the horizon. This summer, every detail will be overanalyzed. But generally speaking, I can't wait to see these elite footballers battle for a trophy. That's what this is all about.\n\nRueter: Jamaica seemingly can't get out of its own way lately. Since qualifying for the 2022 World Cup, the team and its federation seemed to be in a better way, with many of the program's star players returning to secure qualification for this tournament. Leon Bailey appears set to skip out amidst a fresh rift, and time is running out for the Reggae Boyz to make the ambitious leap they aspired to ahead of 2026.\n\nAnzidei: The rematch between Argentina and Chile at MetLife Stadium in the group stage. I was there when Messi missed his penalty kick in 2016. I remember vividly watching a young boy in a Barcelona jersey cry into his father's arms after the final whistle, and later learning the news that Messi retired. Messi has the chance to rewrite this story, and I'm excited to see what happens.\n\nKloke: Copa America is a dry run for the United States co-hosting the World Cup in two years. How will the cities and venues handle hosting these games? What kind of buy-in will local fans show? Then there's the question of transportation around the games which, boring as that might be, has come up as a topic of conversation during the European Championship. There are early signs of anticipation towards 2026 building in some of the cities, but Copa could determine whether that anticipation will continue.\n\nHarris: From a personal perspective, the energy of the fans. I was at Colombia's friendly with Spain at the London Stadium in March, and could hardly believe the noise. Yellow shirts were all I could see when I touched down in Miami airport earlier this week, four days and over 1000 miles away from their opening group game against Paraguay at the weekend.\n\nCardenas: Mexico could be a sleeper, but Ecuador is the obvious choice for me. They're young, athletic and physical. If they can consistently create and finish their chances, Ecuador will emerge as the most dangerous side in the knockout round.\n\nRueter: Last time the Copa Am\u00e9rica came stateside, Chile surprised many by besting a pressure-riddled Argentina on penalties. Equally, that feat feels like a stretch, but they have a favorable Group A draw beyond Argentina and would face the winner of the projected weakest group (likely Ecuador). If Osorio dazzles and veteran holdovers have one last dance in their legs, a semifinal run could be in the cards.\n\nAnzidei: I was at Red Bull Arena in March when Ecuador faced Italy in a friendly, and the crowd was split evenly for both teams. That energy fueled Ecuador, so I'm curious to see how their fans show up during Copa America. Ecuador's group on paper might just be the easiest to get out of. For that reason, they may catch whoever they face in the quarterfinals flatfooted.\n\nKloke: I'm on the Ecuador train as well. Building confidence through a weaker group should help them in the knockout stage.\n\nHarris: They are not going to win the tournament, but I'm hopeful that Venezuela can carry on their positive form. They look hungry to press, are energetic and gritty in midfield, and have real pace and zip on the wings.\n\nCardenas: Messi will turn back the clock and play like he's 10 years younger, but he'll revert to 2010 form and end the tournament without a goal. You said outrageous, right?\n\nRueter: Groups B and C will be entirely absent from the semifinal and final round, as Group A (Argentina, Chile) and Group D (Brazil, Colombia) house all four podium challengers.\n\nAnzidei: Brazil doesn't make it out of groups, because of the bad juju from Ronaldinho's publicity stunt last week. Talk about things you don't do before a major tournament.\n\nKloke: Everyone knows what I'm going to go with, right? Canada dials up the intensity to 11 against Argentina in the tournament opener, tries to throw some elbows around, scores early and shocks the soccer world with a win. Big time Senegal over France in the 2002 World Cup opener vibes here.\n\nHarris: I think that we will end the tournament with a new, all-time leading goalscorer at the Copa America, and it will be... Eduardo Vargas.\n\nLionel Messi needs four goals to equal the record of 17, while Peru's Paulo Guerrero, like Vargas, needs three. But I fancy Chile to make it to the knockouts, and their No 9 has looked sharp at the top of Ricardo Gareca's revitalised team.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New

It's also been dominated heavily by South American teams, with North American teams not participating until 1990, and 47 of 48 prior tournaments were previously held in South America.\n\nMuch of that is now changing as the U.S. is hosting the tournament, starting Thursday and running through July 14, and the American national team is aiming for a strong showing against some of the world's best teams.\n\nThe placement of this year's tournament in the U.S. is the result of a strategic partnership struck early last year between CONMEBOL, the South American federation, and Concacaf, its North American counterpart, that was aimed at building the sport in both regions. The deal included not only putting this year's event in the U.S. but also the participation of CONMEBOL women's teams in the 2024 Concacaf W Gold Cup held earlier this year, and a new joint club competition.\n\nAs a result of the broader geographic focus, the Copa Am\u00e9rica is something of a dress rehearsal for the 2026 World Cup, which will also be held in the U.S., along with cohosts Canada and Mexico. While that preparation certainly relates to the competition and to stadiums, many of which will also be World Cup venues, that's also true for Fox Sports, which holds English-language U.S. rights, and TelevisaUnivision, which has the Spanish-language rights domestically.\n\nIt's also part of a big summer for both networks in soccer as they manage separate coverage of UEFA's Euro 2024, which began earlier this month and will run along a similar schedule as Copa Am\u00e9rica. Though for Fox, some matches from the Euros have been shifted to the subscription-based streamer FuboTV.\n\nIn 2016, the U.S. team made a surprise run on home soil to the Copa Am\u00e9rica semifinals. This time, though, the home squad will face arguably a steeper climb. The Americans are currently ranked No. 11 in the world by FIFA, and is up significantly from its No. 30 slot five years ago. But also in the competition are No. 1 overall and defending World Cup champion Argentina, No. 5 Brazil, No. 12 Colombia, and No. 14 Mexico.\n\nThe Copa Am\u00e9rica \"feels big,\" USMNT captain and midfielder Tyler Adams (above, far right) said earlier this month. \"It's not quite the World Cup, but I think it's the next best thing.\"", "source": {"uri": "frontofficesports.com", "dataType":

We're here to share our 2024 Copa America odds series while making a Copa American 2024 prediction and pick.\n\nThe Copa America should see some interesting twists and turns. Substantially, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Mexico are the favorites to win this tournament. While Colombia and the United States are also somewhat contenders, they don't fall into the range as the betting favorites. Now, let's discuss these four and explain what they bring to the table.\n\nManager Lionel Sealoni is still on Cloud 9 after the Argentinians won the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Now, he hopes to collect more hardware as Argentina looks to win it for the second consecutive tournament. They are the current defending champions. Argentina is also tied with Uruguay for the most tournament wins.\n\nGoalkeeper Emi Martinez won the World Cup Gold Glove. Now, he looks to replicate his great play as he backs the national team in net again. Martinez will have a great defensive duo in Cristian Romero and Nicolas Otamendi. Likewise, they could have Lisandro Martinez, who is a mainstay from Manchester United. Nahuel Molina and Gpnzalo Montiel will battle for right-back.\n\nEnzo Fernandez from Chelsea leads the charge. He scored three goals and two assists in 28 matches in the English Premier League and one goal and one assist in six Copa America Qualifiers. Rodrigo De Paul from Atletico Madrid had three goals and five assists over 34 matches. Meanwhile, Alexis MacAllister of Liverpool had five goals and five assists over 33 matches.\n\nLionel Messi is an absolute legend and is ready for this tournament. Significantly, he had 12 goals and nine assists over 12 matches for Inter Miami. Messi also had seven goals and three assists over seven World Cup matches. Meanwhile, Angel Di Maria is awesome and had nine goals and 10 assists over 28 matches for Benfica, and a goal and an assist over five World Cup matches. These strikers could push Argentina to another title.\n\nWhy Brazil Will In\n\nManager Dorival Junior believes Brazil can recover after losing the 2022 World Cup Quarterfinals to Croatia. Ultimately, he needs his players to bounce back.\n\nGoalkeeper Alisson Becker will compete with Ederson, who suffered a fractured eye socket late in the season. The center-back duo of Marquintos and Gabriel Magalhaes are exceptional, and Brazil will actually field a healthy defense for the first time in forever.\n\nLucas Paqueta of West Ham is a solid midfielder who scored four goals and six assists in 31 matches and one goal and one assist in the 2022 World Cup. Likewise, Bruno Guimaraes of Newcastle had seven goals and eight assists over 37 matches. However, he did not score in the World Cup. The Brazilians will not have Neymar's services because he is dealing with a knee injury.\n\nRodrygo of Real Madrid is their best striker. He scored five goals and two assists in 13 matches. His teammate Vinicius Jr. also scored six goals and four assists in 10 Champions League matches. Vinicius Jr. also had one goal and two assists in the 2022 World Cup. Meanwhile, Raphinha added six goals and nine assists for 28 matches for Barcelona. Raphinha also had three goals and two assists over seven Champions League matches and will be a big force in the Copa America.\n\nWhy Uruguay Will In\n\nThis is an old team mixed with some young talent. Also, there are some question marks. Goalkeeper Sergio Rochet is the main goalkeeper but will need to fend off Santiago Mele and Franco Israel. Jose Maria Gimenez is the only defender with a lot of experience. Ultimately, he will get help from Matias Vina and Ronald Araujo. But there are questions as to how this defense will respond.\n\nTottenham's Rodrigo Bentancur leads the midfielders but managed just one goal and one assist in 23 matches and did not score in the World Cup. Likewise, Federico Valverde had one goal over 13 Champions League matches but also did not score in the World Cup.\n\nLuis Suarez is 37 years old and struggled to make the team. He has also not had a strong tournament since the 2019 Copa America. Edinson Cavani retired. Therefore, Darwin Nunez is the new young star now. He had 11 goals and eight assists over 36 matches for Liverpool. It's time for him to shine on the national stage.\n\nWhy Mexico Will Win\n\nManager Jaime Lozano has implemented a culture of strong defense and opportunistic play. Unfortunately, they lost their goalkeeper, Luis Malagon, to injury. That means that Carlos Acevedo will take over. Meanwhile, the defense will have some help with Johan Vasquez leading the charge. Cesar Montes and Jorge Sanders will help out.\n\nEdson Alvarez and Luis Chavez are the midfielders to watch. Alvarez has not scored on the national stage yet, while Chavez scored one goal in the 2022 World Cup.\n\nAt 23 years old, Santi Gimenez is a young star to watch. He scored 23 goals and six assists in 30 matches for Feyenoord. However, Julian Quinones needs to step up.\n\nFinal 2024 Copa America Prediction & Pick\n\nArgentina is the defending champion, while Brazil is always a threat. Uruguay is filled with questions, and Mexico will be without its starting goalkeeper. Consequently, every country has to deal with injuries. Not having Neymar will hurt the Brazilians, as he is the heart and soul of that country. Argentina is the only country that does not seem to be dealing with any obstacles.

While AI favors Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia, its accuracy will be tested as the tournament unfolds. Will AI's forecasts match reality?\n\nGone are the days when octopuses, armadillos, cats, and mystics held the mantle of soccer predictions. The digital age has brought a new celebrity to the forefront: artificial intelligence (AI). Even in soccer, AI now has its favorite teams and has already shown the 'red card' for the upcoming Copa America 2024. The tournament, set to take place in the United States, will reveal whether AI's predictions are accurate when it concludes on July 14.\n\nThe Copa America 2024 is not immune to the influence of technology. AI now takes center stage in a shift from the days when predictions were the domain of mystics like the Mexican Brujo Mayor or animals like Norman the armadillo, Fedor, the tiger, Achilles the cat, or the unforgettable Paul, the octopus. ChatGPT, one of the most popular AI tools, has assessed the tournament's likely outcomes and identified Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia as the top contenders for the title.\n\nChatGPT's conclusions are based on the teams' performances in recent tournament editions and their matches in the qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup. For Concacaf teams, the AI considered results from the Gold Cup and the Nations League.\n\nChatGPT predicts that Argentina, Canada, Ecuador, Mexico, Uruguay, the United States, Colombia, and Brazil will advance to the quarterfinals in the group stage of Copa America 2024. The AI goes a step further, forecasting the semifinalists and even the tournament winner. For instance, it predicts that Argentina will defeat Mexico in the quarterfinals with a score of [2-1], and Brazil will triumph over Uruguay with a score of [3-0].\n\nAccording to ChatGPT, Argentina, led by Lionel Messi, will eliminate Mexico in the quarterfinals. Ecuador will triumph over Canada, Brazil will defeat Uruguay, and Colombia will oust the United States. This sets up a semifinal lineup of Argentina, Ecuador, Colombia, and Brazil, with the final being a replay of the 2021 final between Argentina and Brazil.\n\n\"Both teams have a rich history in Copa America and international competitions. On a good day, Brazil is capable of anything,\" ChatGPT states. The AI gives Argentina the edge over Brazil, citing Lionel Messi and Argentina's status as the reigning champions. \"Given the talent level and recent history, my prediction would be a narrow victory for Argentina. The possible presence of players like Messi could give Argentina the emotional and technical advantage needed,\" ChatGPT predicts. However, the AI cautions that \"this prediction represents a challenge due to the unpredictability of soccer.\"\n\nAnother popular AI, Gemini, has also made predictions, focusing on the teams likely to perform poorly. \"While Venezuela has the least favorable statistics and history, Bolivia and Peru could also underperform in Copa America. Similarly, Jamaica and Panama from the Concacaf side may struggle,\" Gemini forecasts.\n\nHowever, Gemini also acknowledges the complexities of making such predictions. \"Although historical data can provide clues, it is complex and imprecise to predict with accuracy which will be the worst team in Copa America 2024,\" it notes. The AI wisely advises, \"Soccer is a dynamic sport with constantly changing variables. It is best to analyze the matches and enjoy the tournament.\"\n\nGiven that Uruguay is currently second and Venezuela fourth in the standings for the 2026 World Cup South American qualifiers, even ahead of Brazil in sixth, these AI predictions could be called into question. This underscores the unpredictable nature of soccer, where statistics can sometimes fail to capture the true potential of teams.\n\nThe ultimate truth lies with the players on the field. From June 20 in Atlanta, Messi and his team will begin their campaign to clear the path for Argentina in the opening match against Canada. As the tournament progresses, the accuracy of AI predictions will be put to the test.\n\nIn Latin America, soccer is more than just a sport; it is a cultural phenomenon that unites nations and ignites passions. The foray of AI into soccer predictions reflects the region's growing embrace of technology, but it also underscores the inherent unpredictability of the beautiful game. While AI can analyze past performances and statistical trends, it cannot account for the human spirit, a single player's unexpected brilliance, or a match's shifting dynamics. This celebration of soccer's cultural significance in Latin America is what truly connects us all.\n\nThe use of AI in sports analytics is not new, but its application in predicting outcomes for major tournaments like Copa America marks a significant step forward. AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini can process vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and make informed predictions, offering valuable insights. However, it's important to remember that these predictions are just one part of the puzzle. Human judgment and the unpredictable nature of live sports still play a crucial role, providing a sense of reassurance amidst the AI revolution.\n\nIn Colombia, for example, AI predictions might provide valuable insights for coaching strategies and player selection, but the emotional and psychological aspects of the game remain crucial. Colombia's national team, known for its passionate play and skilled players, often defies statistical expectations, making it a perennial contender in international tournaments.\n\nSimilarly, AI predictions can inform strategies in Mexico, where soccer is deeply ingrained in the national identity. Still, they cannot capture the enthusiasm and unpredictability of matches played in front of passionate home crowds. The Mexican national team's tournament performance often reflects a blend of tactical understanding and emotional intensity, elements AI can analyze but needs to predict fully.\n\nUltimately, soccer's beauty lies in its unpredictability. While AI can offer educated guesses and highlight likely outcomes, the game itself is decided by the skill, strategy, and sometimes sheer luck of the players on the pitch. Fans across Latin America and beyond will watch eagerly to see if the AI predictions hold true or if the tournament will unfold unexpectedly. It's important to remember that AI predictions are not foolproof and that the human element in soccer can often defy statistical expectations.\n\nAs AI continues to evolve and integrate into various aspects of sports, its role in soccer will likely expand. However, the essence of the game -- its ability to surprise, inspire, and unite -- will always remain beyond the full grasp of any algorithm. The Copa America 2024 will testify to this enduring truth, showcasing the dynamic interplay between technology and human talent in sports.\n\nShakira Scores Again as Official Artist for Copa Am\u00e9rica\n\nAs we anticipate the start of Copa America 2024, AI predictions add an exciting layer of analysis and expectation. Whether or not these predictions come true, the tournament will undoubtedly provide thrilling moments, showcasing the best of Latin American soccer and its impact on the global stage.", "source":

It's also been dominated heavily by South American teams, with North American teams not participating until 1990, and 47 of 48 prior tournaments were previously held in South America.\n\nMuch of that is now changing as the U.S. is hosting the tournament, starting Thursday and running through July 14, and the American national team is aiming for a strong showing against some of the world's best teams.\n\nThe placement of this year's tournament in the U.S. is the result of a strategic partnership struck early last year between CONMEBOL, the South American federation, and Concacaf, its North American counterpart, that was aimed at building the sport in both regions. The deal included not only putting this year's event in the U.S. but also the participation of CONMEBOL women's teams in the 2024 Concacaf W Gold Cup held earlier this year, and a new joint club competition.\n\nAs a result of the broader geographic focus, the Copa Am\u00e9rica is something of a dress rehearsal for the 2026 World Cup, which will also be held in the U.S., along with cohosts Canada and Mexico. While that preparation certainly relates to the competition and to stadiums, many of which will also be World Cup venues, that's also true for Fox Sports, which holds English-language U.S. rights, and TelevisaUnivision, which has the Spanish-language rights domestically.\n\nIt's also part of a big summer for both networks in soccer as they manage separate coverage of UEFA's Euro 2024, which began earlier this month and will run along a similar schedule as Copa Am\u00e9rica. Though for Fox, some matches from the Euros have been shifted to the subscription-based streamer FuboTV.\n\nIn 2016, the U.S. team made a surprise run on home soil to the Copa Am\u00e9rica semifinals. This time, though, the home squad will face arguably a steeper climb. The Americans are currently ranked No. 11 in the world by FIFA, and is up significantly from its No. 30 slot five years ago.

The balance, beyond the titles, is that we have enjoyed a lot,\" Scaloni said in a news conference. \"It is a pleasure to see them train and play, how they give themselves. I am not worried about the future of Messi and Di Mar\u00eda. It doesn't make much sense to think about when they're gone. Let's enjoy them now, we'll see what happens later.\n\n\"Messi is fine, he's happy. I have renewed ideas and strength. It's a nice challenge to defend the title.\"\n\nWith an appearance all but assured on Thursday, Messi will break the record for most at a Copa Am\u00e9rica, with 34 to his credit thus far since his debut in the 2007 edition of the tournament. Di Maria, on the other hand, has 23 appearances in the Copa, with the two players having become an integral part of the team that led La Albiceleste to the title in 2021.\n\nThough Di Maria announced his retirement from the national team following Copa Am\u00e9rica, Messi's international future remains unknown with a World Cup in the U.S., Mexico and Canada looming in 2026.\n\nBoth Scaloni and Leandro Paredes anticipated a difficult match against Concacaf side Canada and said Argentina won't be underestimating Jesse Marsch as he leads his young team into action for the first time at a tournament since being named head coach.\n\n\"Canada is a really good team, they have a lot of quality players. They have a new coach that brings in new ideas,\" Scaloni said. \"They are a difficult rival, whoever thinks it's easy would be wrong. We are prepared to play against them they are a difficult rival, and it's the first game of the tournament.\"\n\n\"For us, every rival is considered difficult.

In other words, not exactly the easiest opponent for the debutant to face on Thursday in Atlanta.\n\nIn the past three months, Canada has done all it can to prepare for the marquee match, including hiring experienced and lively head coach Jesse Marsch, and setting up two important friendlies with the Netherlands and France earlier in June. While the odds are certainly against Marsch's squad, if the sport has taught us anything, it's that nothing is impossible.\n\nRead on for key storylines, players to watch and more on the eve of the opening match at Copa Am\u00e9rica 2024.\n\nQuick hits\n\n* Canada and Argentina's match will kick off Copa Am\u00e9rica on June 20 at 8 p.m. ET / 5 p.m. PT at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. The tournament will run until July 14 and feature 16 teams from CONMEBOL and CONCACAF federations.\n\n* Canada and Argentina are part of Group A, which also features Peru and Chile.\n\n* On Monday, Marsch named Bayern Munich star Alphonso Davies as Canada's tournament captain. Porto's Stephen Eust\u00e1quio will be vice-captain.\n\n* Argentine superstar Lionel Messi will become Copa America's most capped player if he gets minutes on Thursday. However, the 36-year-old Messi may not see the pitch, as it's possible he could be rested for later group games.\n\n* Canada's top scorer on the squad is Cyle Larin (29), and its most capped player is Jonathan Osorio (72).\n\n* Argentina's top scorer and most capped on the squad is Messi with 108 goals in 182 games.\n\nDavid vs. Goliath\n\nIt's safe to say that Thursday's match is a classic David vs. Goliath tale. On one hand, we have Canada, the younger, smaller and less regarded team, against Argentina, the soccer giant and predicted winner of Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\nLet's start with Argentina. The reigning World Cup and Copa Am\u00e9rica champion has conceded only four goals in 14 matches since its World Cup final against France a year-and-a-half ago. In its last 58 matches, Lionel Scaloni's side has lost only twice, which is nothing short of remarkable.\n\nOn the pitch, Argentina is adaptable, often playing in either a 4-4-2 or 4-3-3 formation. La Albiceleste's dominance comes from ball control, possession, and pressing in the final third to put opponents under pressure and force mistakes. Because Argentina is so good in tight spaces, players such as Alexis Mac Allister, \u00c1ngel Di Maria, Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez and Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez can pass in triangles and rotate amongst each other up the pitch. This fluid, \"dance-like\" display can be tough to defend against, especially with the pace the South Americans possess. Scaloni is also spoiled with choice when it comes to selecting his lineup for almost every position. This depth certainly keeps Argentina fresh, not just for the full 90 minutes but for the entire tournament.\n\nThat said, Argentina is not without faults. In a 2-0 loss to Uruguay last November, Scaloni's side was caught off guard by long balls, and fell victim to breaks. This is an area Canada should look to exploit, as Marsch has speedy, creative players in Davies and Isma\u00ebl Kon\u00e9, who excel in these kinds of situations.\n\nMoving on to Canada, what's particularly interesting about the Marsch era is how flexible the squad seems to be. In its 4-0 loss to the Dutch earlier in June, Canada had a high press, quick start and a strong aerial presence. However, things quickly fell apart after Ronald Koeman's side found control of the midfield.\n\nAgainst France a few days later, Les Rouges were able to bounce back with renewed faith. Canada showed organization, patience and controlled pace. Intelligent passes and regaining possession proved the squad was capable of playing much more mature soccer, while accurately implementing Marsch's tactical changes. While it wasn't Didier Deschamps' best lineup, the takeaway is that Canada is able to take on some of the world's best teams and not completely lose its cool.\n\nPlayers to watch\n\nIsma\u00ebl Kon\u00e9, Canada\n\nWhile Davies, Tajon Buchanan and Jonathan David are household names in Canadian soccer, Kon\u00e9 is the new kid on the block. The 22-year-old shined for Watford of England's second-tier division in what was otherwise a dismal campaign, ranking in the 91st percentile for progressive carries per 90 minutes. With 19 caps and two goals in a Canada shirt, Kon\u00e9 is known for bursts of pace, stability in the midfield and creating goal-scoring opportunities. After a Man of the Match performance in Canada's 0-0 draw with France on June 9, Canadian fans will hope he can do the same against Messi & Co.\n\nLautaro Mart\u00ednez, Argentina\n\nLautaro Mart\u00ednez is in the form of his life. For Inter Milan this past season, he scored 27 goals in all competitions, 24 of which came in Serie A where he helped his club to another title. While Mart\u00ednez has often been in competition with Manchester City's \u00c1lvarez for the striking spot opposite Messi, the 26-year-old rose to the occasion in a recent Copa Am\u00e9rica tune up, scoring twice for Argentina its 4-1 win over Guatemala on June 14. Known for his positioning inside the box, finishing ability and work rate, Mart\u00ednez will be key in helping Argentina open its tournament in good fashion.\n\nPredicted lineups\n\nCanada

For the first time since 2016, the historic tournament returns to the United States, and cities and stadiums throughout the country will host all 32 matches.\n\nThe USA were sorted into Group C along with Uruguay, Bolivia, and Panama. After two underwhelming Copa America tune-ups against Colombia and Brazil, Gregg Berhalter's men have a lot to prove in their first test of the competition on June 23 against Bolivia.\n\nAs much as the Stars and Stripes are focused on their performances over the next few weeks, though, their play at Copa America 2024 is about more than just doing well at the tournament. In fact, the USMNT must use their matches and their competition as a stepping stone for the 2026 World Cup.\n\nThis summer, the USMNT's has the rare opportunity to play and develop alongside some of the best competition in the world. Copa America 2024 features the most elite players in soccer, including Argentina's Lionel Messi and Brazil's Vinicius Jr., and the USA get to see where they rank among the superstars and their countries ahead of the 2026 World Cup.\n\nBerhalter's squad has the ability to answer a lot of questions before the World Cup and lay the foundation for their future success in all areas on the pitch.\n\nThe USA's defense suffered a huge blow when starting right-back, Sergi\u00f1o Dest, tore his ACL in April. Stepping into his role is Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach's Joe Scally. The 21-year-old must help his backline lock down attacking threats all tournament, but especially those on Colombia or Brazil, two teams the USA could face in the Copa America quarter-finals and again in 2026.\n\nAlthough Scally will likely lose his spot to Dest once the right-back is fit again, he now gets the opportunity to develop on one of the world's biggest stages and announce himself as a reliable backup should Berhalter need him to step up at the 2026 World Cup.\n\nTim Ream's performance this summer also must be top-notch if the defender expects to make the starting XI for the Stars and Stripes in 2026, when he will be 38 years old. Cameron Carter-Vickers could get some Copa America minutes to give Berhalter another center-back option for the future.\n\nIt is no secret the USMNT's midfield has had a lot of rotating players not necessarily playing at their best positions in the last few years. Finally, though, there is some consistency with Gio Reyna and Weston McKennie. The two players must continue to build their chemistry this summer, both with one another and their forwards up front.\n\nThere are also emerging young stars, like Johnny Cardoso and Malik Tillman, that get to learn from the veterans on the squad about what it takes to control a game from the midfield against superior competition like Uruguay's Fede Valverde, who the USA will play on July 1.\n\nShould Cardoso and Tillman get some minutes off the bench at Copa America 2024, they will be more than ready when their numbers gets called in 2026.\n\nArguably more important than tuning up their defense or midfield is the USMNT's forwards. Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah need a consistent striker between them to lock in the USA's attacking trio.\n\nIn the past few months alone, Haji Wright, Folarin Balogun, and Ricardo Pepi have started at striker, and Josh Sargent would have likely been on the list as well had he not been injured. A true No. 9 needs to emerge this summer so the USMNT do not have the same goalscoring issues they had last World Cup.\n\nThe job is Balogun's to lose, and if the AS Monaco man has an impressive tournament, then the USA can finally find consistency with their front three as they look to make a deep run in their home World Cup.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

FIFA recognises 211 nations that have a national football team.\n\nIf we say that each national team has an average 25-man squad, this means that international footballers make up just 0.04% of male professional footballers.\n\nThat doesn't take into account that plenty of lesser decorated footballing nations have national teams full of amateurs or semi-pros. The point is that the vast majority of footballers would be absolutely thrilled to make it to their national team and represent their nation.\n\nLionel Messi represented Argentina almost 200 times, and he'll be captaining them at the Copa America very soon.\n\nIn fact, Messi has been playing international football for so long that there are four players going to this year's Copa America who literally weren't born when Messi made his senior international debut on 17th August 2005 (a 2-1 victory over Hungary).\n\nLet's take a closer look at the four kids no doubt making Leo Messi feel truly ancient in the USA this summer.\n\nThe London-born defender has many senior appearances for the Canadian national team as he does for his club, Fulham. The number is 1 (one). His only Fulham appearance came in a 3-1 League Cup win over Ipswich in November 2o23. He made his Canada debut as a sub against Trinidad & Tobago in a Copa America qualifier.\n\n100% senior record, baby!\n\nDe Fougerolles' dad is from Montreal, and the 18-year-old chose to represent the country of his father's birth at international level. This could be his chance to burst onto the scene.\n\nRojas was born four months after Messi's Argentina debut. The Costa Rican 18-year-old has made one senior appearance for his national side to date, and scored one senior goal. We got ourselves another 100% record.\n\nThe teenage winger plays his club football with Herediano (nicknamed El Team...) in his native Costa Rica, where he's been a first-team regular since his 2022 debut. The new Joel Campbell, perhaps?\n\nREAD NEXT: 5 rising ballers you must keep an eye on at the 2024 Copa America this summer?\n\nTRY A QUIZ: Can you name every host city at the 2024 Copa America?\n\nThis shirt-tucking, collar-popping son of a gun is the future. Already bagged three goals in six games for the Selecao, and Real Madrid awaits.\n\nWe don't want to curse the 17-year-old prodigy but we've been rarely been more confident of someone hitting the ground running after a big move.\n\nEndrick is stocky and strong, with frighteningly good feet and a proper eye for goal. If the teenager can become half the player that other prodigal stocky sons have become i.e. Ronaldo Nazario and Wayne Rooney, he'll be doing just fine.\n\nCopa 2024 is Endrick's Copa -- believe it.\n\nChelsea tied up a contract for Ecuador's most promising talent in decades over a year ago. He'll join the blues when he turns 18, which isn't until next May.\n\nPaez is a midfielder with silky feet, and he's not frightened to make things happen with those feet.\n\nYou'd imagine he'll be eased into the Chelsea set-up, with plenty of senior players in his position (Cole Palmer, for one), but if Paez can make in impact at the Copa America -- who knows?", "source": {"uri": "planetfootball.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Planet Football"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_martin@planetfootball.com", "name": "Andrew Martin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EFL Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Costa Rica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Costa Rica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipswich", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ipswich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ipswich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trinidad and Tobago"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Trinidad and Tobago"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cole Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.S._Herediano", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "C.S.

The 36-year-old forward remains as dynamic as ever and is a member of Inter Miami in Major League Soccer. With Miami, he scored 13 goals in just 18 league games, including 12 in 12 matches this season. Since beginning his professional career in 2003-2004, he has registered 740 goals in 914 career appearances. For his national team, he has been just as impressive, scoring 108 goals in 182 appearances.\n\nAlso helping power Argentina is Angel Di Maria. The 36-year-old forward has scored 31 goals in 140 appearances for the national team. In four matches this year for Argentina, Di Maria has scored twice, including the lone goal in a 1-0 friendly victory over Ecuador on June 9. As a member of Benfica of Portugal's Primeira Liga, he recorded nine goals in 28 matches this past season. See which team to pick here.\n\nWhy you should back Canada\n\nForward Cyle Larin is among Canada's offensive threats. Since 2014, the 29-year-old has scored 29 times in 68 appearances for the national team. In the qualifying playoff win over Trinidad and Tobago, he scored the match's first goal. His best year for Canada came in 2021 when he registered 14 goals in 13 matches. As a member of Mallorca of La Liga in Spain, he scored three goals in 35 matches this past season.\n\nForward Jonathan David is a young, up-and-coming standout for the Canadians.

The three teams have combined to win 39 of the 47 Copa Am\u00e9rica tournaments.\n\nWhile finding a team with longer odds won't be easy, there is still some value in targeting other futures markets.\n\nOdds via Caesars Sportsbook\n\nAlthough this tournament feels somewhat top-heavy, Colombia deserves more respect, given its odds. Surprisingly, Mexico's odds are slightly shorter at +1100 despite not being a member of the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL).\n\nCopa Am\u00e9rica organizers began inviting countries outside the CONMEBOL in 1993 after revising the format to include a group stage. No non-CONMEBOL member has ever won the Copa America tournament.\n\nColombia enters as one of the hottest teams, having won eight straight matches. Two of those victories came against Brazil (2-1) in a World Cup qualifier and Spain (1-0) in a friendly.\n\nLuis Diaz is a tireless worker on the left wing who can leave defenders in his dust. He can wow the crowd with his dribbling skills as he looks to cut into the box.\n\nJames Rodriguez will likely drop deeper, using his technical ability on the ball to spring the Colombian attack.\n\nThere's a lot to like about this team at the moment, and at +1200, the odds simply don't reflect its overall quality.\n\nWith sportsbooks likely inundated with money on the United States to win the group, Uruguay at -138 is a reasonably short price.\n\nAgainst inferior teams, Uruguay tries to punish the opposition by making probing runs into the box.\n\nManager Marcelo Bielsa is getting more out of his striker Darwin Nunez on the international level. Nunez has scored eight goals in his last seven caps under Bielsa despite failing to live up to lofty expectations in club soccer since his move to Liverpool for a $78.6 million fee.\n\nHe had one of the worst returns (11) on expected goals (16.3) of any Premier League player, and there is some thought that Liverpool could try to sell him after just two seasons.\n\nIf Copa Am\u00e9rica is indeed a chance for Nunez to audition for potential suitors, he'll likely be the most impactful player in Group C.\n\nLa Verde has just one win in its last 30 matches at Copa America and has failed to register even a point in seven of its last eight tournaments. I'm surprised Bolivia's odds of finishing last in the group aren't closer to -200.\n\nMoreover, Bolivia will be without its top scorer, Marcelo Martins, who recently retired.\n\nWhile new manager Antonio Carlos Zago has focused on strengthening the team defensively, it's tough to see where the goals will come from.\n\nBolivia is easily the worst team in this group, and it's not even close.\n\nGiven its current odds, backing Bolivia to finish last might be the steal of the Copa Am\u00e9rica tournament.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

The tournament is scheduled to start on Thursday, June 20th as reigning World Cup winners Argentina face Canada. The entire competition will play out across 14 cities in the United States. This is just the second time that the tournament is scheduled to be hosted by a nation outside of South America. Brazil previously hosted the last two iterations of the Copa America.\n\nWith just a couple of days to go before the start of the competition, a new report has sifted through every Copa America roster to determine which league is the most represented at the tournament. According to the review, MLS is tied with England's Premier League for the most players in the prestigious competition. Both leagues will have 41 players competing in the summer tournament.\n\nWhile a plethora of Copa America stars currently play at MLS clubs, not many of these players come from the USMNT. As hosts, the Stars and Stripes will compete at the tournament for just the sixth time. Just three Americans listed in Gregg Berhalter's squad currently feature for MLS teams. This trio includes goalkeeper Sean Johnson (Toronto), Miles Robinson (Cincinnati), and Shaq Moore (Nashville).\n\nCanada, on the other hand, currently has the most MLS representation of any national team at the Copa America. Jesse Marsch's new team features 14 total players on MLS rosters. Eight of these stars are currently on American clubs, with the remaining six featuring for one of the trio of Canadian MLS teams. In total, 21 of the 29 MLS clubs have players at the 2024 Copa America.\n\nLeagues that have the most players at Copa America 2024:\n\n41 - Premier League (England)\n\n41 - MLS (USA/Canada)\n\n35 - Liga MX (Mexico)\n\n35 - Serie A (Brazil)\n\n28 - La Liga (Spain)\n\n23 - Serie A (Italy)\n\n20 - Primera Divisi\u00f3n (Bolivia)\n\n16 - Primera Divisi\u00f3n (Argentina)\n\n16 - Liga FPD (Costa Rica)\n\n13 - Championship (England)\n\n13 - Primeira Liga (Portugal)\n\nMinnesota United and CF Montreal will each feature four players at Copa America 2024. This tops all MLS clubs. Yet, it is not quite enough to crack the top 10 clubs in terms of number of players at the tournament. For instance, Bolivian top-flight side Bol\u00edvar will have nine total stars at the tournament. All of these players will feature with the Bolivia national team. The USMNT will face off against the South Americans in their opening match of Group C on June 23rd.\n\nCosta Rican side Saprissa and Liga MX giants Club America also have seven players each at the tournament. English top-flight team Fulham will feature five stars at Copa America 2024. Two of these players, defensive duo Antonee Robinson and Tim Ream, are currently on the USMNT roster.

'It was wild'", "body": "The history of the U.S. men's national team dates back more than a century, and even with a 40-year drought between World Cup appearances mixed into that lore, the Americans have still participated in soccer's premier event 10 times.\n\nThe USMNT's history in the Copa Am\u00e9rica is shorter. All four of the program's appearances have come since 1993. Their fifth arrives in just a few days, as coach Gregg Berhalter's squad hosts the best teams in the Western Hemisphere in sport's longest running international tournament.\n\nTo help us prepare for USA 2024, FOX Sports spoke to six former U.S. players -- Berhalter, Alejandro Bedoya, Jonathan Bornstein, Brad Guzan, Tony Meola and Tab Ramos -- who were members of Copa Am\u00e9rica rosters past and kind enough to share their experiences.\n\nMuch like the current U.S. team, the Americans used the 1993 Copa Am\u00e9rica to help them prepare for a fast-approaching World Cup at home. Unlike this year, then-coach Bora Milutinovi\u0107 was missing a number of key players who had just competed in the U.S. Cup, a friendly tournament in which the U.S. stunned England 2-0. One week later, a different U.S. team made the country's Copa debut in a hard-fought 1-0 loss to Uruguay. Ramos was the captain.\n\nTab Ramos: It's hard to believe now, but our players looked at the U.S. Cup as the more important competition at the time. Some of the guys didn't really know much about Copa Am\u00e9rica. They didn't know the magnitude of it.\n\nTony Meola: I have family in Argentina, so I knew how big it was. I knew what it meant to Colombia or Brazil or Uruguay.\n\nRamos: In general, most of our guys treated it as just another tournament, an opportunity to showcase themselves. It was a little bit of a tryout. We still had college guys on that team.\n\nThe U.S. lost its second game to the host nation, ending any chance of advancing. But they were up 3-0 over Venezuela in the group finale before settling for a 3-3 tie.\n\nRamos: We're playing in South America, against South American teams, in games you have to win. We saw an intensity that we weren't used to seeing. Back then, Venezuela was the worst team in CONMEBOL, and yet they fought back to tie us. It was a real eye-opener.\n\nMeola: Bora's big thing was making sure we'd never be in awe of meeting a team at the World Cup for the first time, so he wanted to play everyone. It did kind of take away the mystique of playing against some of these teams. That helped quite a bit in 1994.\n\nRamos: I wish we had represented ourselves better, but in 1993 we were still getting our feet wet at the international level. The U.S. Cup was really our only major competition. We had big results, but they were friendlies. Teams didn't take us seriously until we knocked Colombia out of the 1994 World Cup. That was really our first legit win, the first time we earned a little bit of respect by winning a game that really mattered. But the summer of 1993 was a turning point. After that, we became a competitive national team worldwide.\n\nMeola: For me, and I think the guys in '95 will tell you the same thing: It's as close to being in a World Cup as it gets.\n\nThe U.S. returned to the Copa Am\u00e9rica as a battle-tested side. The Americans had reached the second round of the World Cup a year earlier before losing to eventual champ Brazil. They played with no fear, routing Argentina 3-0 in the group stage and advancing to the semifinals, where Brazil once again eliminated them with a 1-0 victory.\n\nRamos: The feeling was completely different in 1995. Now we knew the magnitude of Copa Am\u00e9rica. We wanted to have the best team we could have.\n\nGregg Berhalter: I had two caps coming into the tournament, so it wasn't like I was a main part of the team. I viewed it as an amazing experience for a young player. I looked up to a lot of the older guys who had starred at the World Cup the year before.\n\nTo see the intensity we brought and to compete the way we did, it was really special. We had a lot of confidence. I remember specifically the performance Alexi Lalas and Frank Klopas had against Argentina. It was a great group to learn from and just a fun ride -- that's the best way to describe it.\n\nRamos: By 1995, all of our players were playing on clubs somewhere overseas. We knew -- and I'm gonna say this with a straight face -- that we could beat anyone. We might have to get lucky, but we could beat anyone.\n\nBerhalter: Maradona came to watch the game before ours, and he sat down in the seat right in front of me. He saw our tracksuits, turned around and shook our hands. Within five minutes the entire stadium was chanting his name. It's one of the best experiences I ever had in soccer.\n\nTo go out and beat Argentina 3-0 is an amazing accomplishment. That's a marquee win in the program's history. The American spirit shined through in that tournament.\n\nThe U.S. returned to Copa for the third time as an invited guest. But most of the regulars didn't go after helping the Americans beat Mexico in the Concacaf Gold Cup final, which was played in Chicago three days before the 2007 Copa kicked off. Left back Jonathan Bornstein was one of the few players who competed in both events. The U.S. opened the tournament with a 4-1 loss to Argentina and a youngster named Lionel Messi, who had just turned 20.\n\nJonathan Bornstein: The Gold Cup roster was pretty much all European-based. But the European players needed to go back to before their seasons, so that Copa America squad was a majority of MLS guys.\n\nBrad Guzan: It was more or less a completely different group.\n\nBornstein: Everybody was aware of Messi, but there were a lot of very high quality players on Argentina: Carlos Tevez, Javier Mascherano. I can still remember the intensity with which they passed the ball. It was like nothing I'd ever seen. I remember a really hard driven ball into [Juan Rom\u00e1n] Riquelme, and he just cushions in front of him like it was like a soft pass. Just the speed and the pace at which they did things, it was another level. I was like, 'Damn, that's how I have to play.' It was a great learning experience for the entire team.\n\nIt was an experience off the field, too. Political relations between Venezuela and the U.S. had deteriorated significantly in the years before that edition of the Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\nBornstein: We weren't very welcome. We always had to have security with us. For our safety, we couldn't leave our hotel compound. When we would drive from the hotel to the practice field, we'd have a helicopter overhead with soldiers holding machine guns leaning out the door. That's the thing I remember the most.\n\nGuzan: The helicopter was only 100 feet above us. We had a decoy bus, we had Humvees in front and behind, had to take different routes to training. The training pitch was surrounded by armed soldiers. It was wild.\n\nThe U.S. narrowly lost its next two games, to Paraguay and Colombia.\n\nBornstein: We might not have been playing in Europe at the time, but we were quality soccer players representing our country. I remember Bob [Bradley, the U.S. coach] mentioning, like, 'This is the team that was chosen, and this is the team that's got to get the job done.\" That was the mentality of the group, even if we didn't get the results we wanted. The last two games we were in. If a couple of bounces had gone our way, for sure we could've gotten points out of them.\"\n\nTo celebrate the 100th anniversary of the inaugural Copa Am\u00e9rica, CONMEBOL and Concacaf joined forces to organize an expanded 16-team event to be hosted in packed NFL Stadiums across the U.S.\n\nBedoya: It was special to play in that Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario. I grew up in a Colombian household, and we always watched the Copa. Colombia won it in 2001, when the tournament was held there. My family was so happy. After the World Cup, it's the biggest trophy there is for South American teams.\n\nGuzan: It was exciting to be part of a Copa Am\u00e9rica again. Hosting it added another element to it.\n\nThe U.S. dropped its opener to Colombia, then reeled off victories against Costa Rica and Paraguay to top the group. That set up a quarterfinal with Ecuador in Seattle, which the home team won 2-1.\n\nGuzan: The pitch wasn't great. It was super heavy. That said, we were up for it. We knew we put ourselves in a perfect spot to get a big result, and we did. It was a fantastic day for U.S. Soccer.\n\nThe only downside? Bedoya and fellow midfielder Jermaine Jones were suspended for the semifinal against Messi's Argentina.\n\nBedoya: That's one of my biggest regrets. I wish me and Jermaine were available for that Argentina game, because we all know what happened.\n\nThe shorthanded U.S. lost 4-0. Messi opened the scoring early by beating Guzan with an inch-perfect free kick, and Argentina never looked back.\n\nGuzan: It's not every day you have someone who can get the ball up and over the wall and still have it move away from you into the top corner. You're trying to allow the wall to do its job and not cheat. Obviously, he scored. But I'm not sure we even touched the ball during the first 20 minutes of that game.\n\nThe defeat sent the Americans to the third place match, where they again faced -- and lost to -- Colombia.\n\nBedoya: It's not a final, but it's still a match you want to win. You want to finish as high as possible. I grew up cheering for the Colombian team. It's a special game for myself and my family. But I represent USA. I'm American. So yeah, I definitely wanted to win the third place game. Unfortunately, we fell short again. But overall, we had a good Copa Am\u00e9rica. I thought we played pretty well given the opponents we faced.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Anyone can win any football match. Don't rule it out. Of course, it's a long shot. Argentina are an excellent side. They've been in great form since Qatar and they're the favourites for Copa America. It's going to be incredibly tough,\" Caldwell said on TSN Radio Thursday morning.\n\n\"I think for Canada, they've got to just play the best game possible for their 11. I think the start of the match is going to be very fast with lots of emotion and energy inside the stadium. Canada will have to manage that and just break this game up into little blocks. Get through the first 15 minutes and start to feel comfortable.\"\n\nThursday's match in Atlanta will be the first in a competitive fixture for Canada's new manager, Jesse Marsch. His side has been tasked with stopping an Argentina squad that has not lost since dropping their opening match of the World Cup to Saudi Arabia nearly two years ago.\n\nCaldwell believes Canada, who moved up one spot in FIFA's ranking to No. 48 ahead of Copa America, has a path to upsetting their heavily favoured opponents.\n\n\"I think Canada can score, I really do. In terms of attack, Canada can hurt Argentina. They're a little vulnerable down the sides. Just getting the chances in the right areas and actually being able to counter on them. I think Canada can score,\" Caldwell said. \"The best result for me is probably a 1-1 draw, but you never know. If Canada gets that goal with a little bit of luck and the goalkeeper plays great, you can come away with a victory.\"\n\nFans from around the world have descended on Atlanta to watch Argentina and their globally renowned superstar. Messi, who will be playing his seventh Copa, will be the focus for Canada as they attempt to pull off the monumental upset.\n\n\"To stop him takes a lot of plans. It's not one person's responsibility. It's the whole team being aware and concentrating on his possession the entire game,\" said Caldwell. \"He relies on his intelligence and game knowledge to inject energy and pace. That is the task ahead for Canada. To prevent him from getting to areas where he's unstoppable, to hone in on where he wants to be effective and do your absolute best to stop him.\n\n\"He'll still go to other positions and he can still be very effective with his playmaking but I think that's the lesser of two evils when it comes to Messi hurting you as an opposition team.\"\n\nDespite being heavy favourites to win the match, Argentina manager Lionel Scaloni says his team needs to be prepared for a motivated Canadian side.\n\n\"Canada is a very good team, they have important players and a new coach who has brought in new ideas,\" Scaloni said. \"They are a complicated opponent, but we are prepared to play our game.\"\n\nWith the world's eyes set on Mercedes Benz Stadium, Caldwell says much of the pressure will be on Argentina to set the tone in the opening match of the 48th Copa America.\n\n\"[Argentina] is a brilliant team. They're tough but they're also very skilled and talented. They don't expect anything. They fight for everything, they have a great spirit and determination under Lionel Scaloni,\" he said. \"It's going to be fascinating because the pressure is on them to go out and entertain these fans and give them a resounding victory.\"", "source": {"uri": "tsn.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "TSN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sports_Network", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Sports Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Scaloni", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Scaloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.tsn.ca/content/dam/tsn/en/home/images/2023/6/15/alphonso-davies--canadian-men-s-team-celebrates-1-1973888-1686879066446.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658543", "eventUri": "eng-9658543", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

So far, the news is mixed -- he has not been ruled out of the whole tournament and does not immediately need surgery, but his availability for France's high-stakes Group D match against the Netherlands on Friday \"remains uncertain.\" Here's more from the medical team's initial statement on the World Cup winner's condition.\n\nFrance's medical team: \"Kylian Mbappe has suffered a broken nose. He is back in camp with the rest of the squad and will undergo treatment in the coming days without undergoing immediate surgery. A mask will be constructed in order to enable the French team's No. 10 to consider resuming competition after a period of treatment.\"\n\nPlaying without Mbappe in arguably their most competitive group stage match is far from ideal for France, especially since he created the chance that led to Maximilian Wober's own goal in the opening match. Deschamps is not without options, though. Olivier Giroud seems like his most obvious replacement even at the age of 37, but is still in strong form after a 17 goal, nine assist season for AC Milan. Antoine Griezmann and Ousmane Dembele, who both started on Monday, can also be counted on for goals -- Griezmann scored 24 goals for Atletico Madrid last season, while Dembele had 12 assists for Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nEnd-to-end action\n\nFrance's victory is in trend with the other favorites to win the tournament, most of whom won their opening matches. That includes Portugal, who began their Euros campaign with a come-from-behind win over Czechia courtesy of a stoppage time game-winner from Francisco Conceicao. Not all of the top-ranked teams fared well, though -- Belgium lost 1-0 to Slovakia despite taking 16 shots, marking the most lopsided victory in the competition's history based on FIFA rankings.\n\nIt was not the only historic moment in Germany this week, either. Romania collected their first win at the Euros in 24 years when they beat Ukraine 3-0 on Monday, while Turkey spoiled Georgia's major tournament debut with a 3-1 win that might go down as one of the most entertaining matches of the competition. Earlier on Wednesday, Albania dramatically drew 2-2 with Croatia as both teams earned their first points of the competition.\n\nSponsored by Paramount+\ud83d\udd17 Midfield Link Play\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7 Argentina begin Copa America title defense\n\nThe Copa America begins on Thursday with all eyes on -- who else? -- Argentina, who might be at a major tournament with Lionel Messi for the last time.\n\nExpectations are high for Argentina, three years after winning the Copa America and a year and a half removed from winning the World Cup. They did not earn top spot in Chuck Booth's power rankings solely on their recent history, though -- Argentina have found a way to blend experience with promising youngsters in recent years, demonstrating that they are far more than just a one-man team.\n\nMessi, who turns 37 next week, is unlikely to shed his status as Argentina's focal point as long as he is on the national team but manager LIonel Scaloni has been able to bridge the age gap that exists in his multigenerational squad. Their Copa America roster includes promising young attackers like 19-year-olds Alejandro Garnacho, who registered 10 goals and five assists for Manchester United last season, and Valentin Carboni, who spent last season at Monza on loan from Inter and has two caps for the national team. Messi himself has praised Carboni's talent following their 4-1 win over Guatemala last week, and CBS Sports Golazo Network contributor Felipe Cardenas teases that he might play a sizable role at this summer's competition.\n\nCardenas: \"Messi was coaching him throughout that first half. They were on the same side together and every once in a while, Messi would just give him a hand gesture, tell him to go out a bit wider, tell him to tuck in a little bit. ... Messi really does value his talent. He came out after the game and said, 'This is a player we need to take care of, we need to take advantage of.' He's been watching him since his U-20 days.\"\n\nArgentina will open up their title defense against Canada in Atlanta, the first match in a favorable group that includes Chile and Peru. A path to the final seems probable for the reigning champions, too -- other favorites to win the competition like Brazil, Uruguay and Colombia are all on the other side of the bracket.

Strong performances at the 2022 World Cup add weight to the argument that the 25-year-old fully deserves to be a first-choice starter.\n\nThe 26-year-old scored nine goals and claimed five assists to help Aston Villa secure Champions League football next season - and catch the eye of other clubs. However, before club football resumes the midfielder will be bidding to play an important role in Brazil's bid to regain their Copa America title.\n\nLiverpool's Nunez should go into the tournament full of confidence, following a hat-trick in the friendly win against Mexico. The 24-year-old forward is a handful and can help his country push for a 16th Copa America title - and first for 13 years.\n\nLike Mac Allister, Alvarez will be keen to replicate his fine form at the 2022 World Cup. The 24-year-old Manchester City forward can be key in the world champions' quest for more silverware, having scored 11 goals and registered nine assists in the Premier League in 2023-24.\n\nThe 22-year-old can take control of the Ecuador midfield and be an important player for his country. Chelsea's big-money signing from Brighton prospered towards the end of the Premier League season and finished with a flourish, scoring from the halfway line in the final match against Bournemouth.\n\nDiaz, 27, proved he has the pedigree for this tournament in 2021, scoring four goals in five games. The winger's creativity for Liverpool brought eight goals and five assists last season and he can again be a strong influence for Colombia this summer.\n\nRomero played a vital role in Argentina's World Cup win two years ago, starting six of their seven matches. Tottenham's 26-year-old centre-back, who also carries a threat in the opposition penalty area, will hope it is the same story in the Copa America.\n\nMilton Keynes-born Robinson was one of the standout left-backs in the Premier League last season. If the 26-year-old can maintain his form - and his team-mates collectively excel - the United States could make the most of their host nation status and enjoy a fruitful tournament.\n\nWith a solid first season in the top flight behind him following his move from Ajax, Alvarez should be full of confidence heading into the Copa America. Mexico have never won the tournament and will likely need the 26-year-old West Ham midfielder to be at his best if they are to break their duck.\n\nThe 26-year-old midfielder goes into the tournament on the back of two consistent seasons with Newcastle, helping him become a favourite with the fans. If he can help Dorival Junior's team land the Copa America for a 10th time, he could achieve similar cult status in his home nation.", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Mexico is experiencing an identity crisis and Canada has overtaken Costa Rica as the region's third power, led by top players like Alphonso Davies and Jonathan David.\n\nThe three nations needn't fret over World Cup qualification thanks to being co-hosts in 2026, so the 2024 Copa America represents their only meaningful competition between now and then.\n\nWhile this year's tournament takes place in CONCACAF territory, its narratives and thrills will be dictated by CONMEBOL. Few tournaments can match the passion stirred by a Copa America.\n\nDo you like stars? Of course you do. There are world-class players aplenty to be found in the 16-team field.\n\nYou've read plenty about his exploits in heron pink for Inter Miami over the past 12 months, but even his greatest skeptics have to admit: there's something special about him when he pulls on the white and sky blue of Argentina.\n\nThis will be his first major tournament since Argentina won the 2022 World Cup and we could see the soon-to-be 37-year-old in a rare, pressure-free headspace. It may also be our last chance to catch him on a big international stage, as it's unclear whether he'll retire before 2026.\n\nDrink it in, one and all. There's something on this tournament menu for every appetite.\n\nYou can subscribe to The Athletic using our discount code for the tournament here. We'll make sure you have plenty to discuss within your group chats.\n\nFirst up, who's competing? Well... we've got individual nation guides on the 16 teams below, but here are a few things to look out for...\n\nIf your focus is more individually driven, there is The Radar: Copa America, which profiles 50 players to watch at the tournament, from established stars to ones on the rise.\n\nAnd if you want a breakdown of all the squads at the competition, you can find that here.\n\nThe brilliant Thom Harris has gone into the weeds on all 16 teams to update you on how they've played in recent months.\n\nThere's also our ultimate data guide to the squads, which will make you look even more clever to your friends. Did you know Jonathan David has the best goals-per-cap rate of any player at the tournament whose name isn't Lionel Messi? No, me neither.\n\nThe United States were host nation and a dark horse in 2016, reaching the semifinal before falling to Messi and Argentina. That proved to be an aberration, as they failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, but they are back at the top of the CONCACAF pecking order and trying to size up if a deep run is possible in two years' time.\n\nIt still is a bit odd when a guest nation joins a continental tournament, whether it's Qatar in the CONCACAF Gold Cup or, well, the United States hosting a second South American jamboree in under a decade. Elias Burke charted the past performances of these guest entries. Perhaps this tournament will see its first champion outside the confines of CONMEBOL...\n\nAntonee Robinson had a career-best season for Fulham, proving to be among the Premier League's best left-backs. His focus now shifts to the international arena; as he tells Peter Rutzler, it's time for the USMNT to take the next step toward being a global contender.\n\nJohnny Cardoso is among the squad's fastest risers in recent years, going from a mysterious prospect in Brazil to a mainstay of Real Betis' midfield. He gave a rare interview to Jack Lang, giving insight into what motivates him and what he aspires to be.\n\nThe USMNT exited the 2022 World Cup in the round of 16, but no player was harder done by than Gio Reyna. Eighteen months have passed since the drama around his lack of playing time and the signs a relationship with Berhalter needed mending. Last week, Reyna spoke with USMNT expert Paul Tenorio about getting his career back on track.\n\nAnd here's my comprehensive scouting guide to each member of the USMNT squad, updating you on their recent form and highlighting strengths and weaknesses.\n\nElsewhere, our writers have given their predictions for the tournament: who will win it? Which players will shine brightest? And which dark horses could bust the bracket open?\n\nMessi's greatest rival Cristiano Ronaldo is playing across the Atlantic at Euro 2024 and their two-man dynasty has been explored here in a detailed look at their international goal records.\n\nThe sport cannot live off those two forever and a rising generation of talent has been desperate to get more time in the spotlight. This tournament boasts quite a few of them...\n\nThis Copa America provides a platform for some elder statesmen to shine, too.\n\nBut wait, there's more!\n\nThis is as straightforward as brackets get: four groups of four teams, with the top two finishers advancing to the quarterfinal. It's a fixed bracket from there:\n\nIn the group stage, the tiebreaking protocol for any two teams on level footing -- well, save for irrelevant ties between third and fourth -- is as follows:\n\nGroup stage games will conclude after 90 minutes, even if they're played to a draw. A tie game at full time in the knockout rounds will advance to two 15-minute halves of extra time and advance to a penalty shootout if the game is still deadlocked after two hours of action.\n\nOn top of all this, we will be covering all the off-pitch news as it happens, bringing you details from the team camps, media conferences, and any other breaking news.\n\nAway from the Copa America, we will continue to cover the summer transfer window, with our weekly Transfer DealSheet coming out every Tuesday as well as The Athletic 500 Transfer Ratings, which you can read about here.\n\nGo touch grass

It's the South American equivalent of the Euros. You're talking about nations like Brazil and Argentina who've won the World Cup multiple times between them,\" said John Molinaro, founder of the website TFC Republic and a long-time observer of Canada's national team. \"This is a chance for Canada to sort of rub shoulders with some of the best teams in the world.\"\n\nRanked 49th in the FIFA world rankings, Canada is one of six CONCACAF qualifiers invited to the event, alongside Mexico and the U.S. With a roster that mirrors the one used at the World Cup, Canada will rely on international stars such as Alphonso Davies (Bayern Munich), Jonathan David (Lille), and Tajon Buchanan (Inter Milan).\n\nFollowing their match against world No. 1 Argentina, Canada will face Peru (No. 32) on June 25 in Kansas City and Chile (No. 42) on June 29 in Orlando to conclude the group stage. Molinaro views the tournament as a crucial preparatory step for Canada's role as co-host of the 2026 World Cup.\n\n\"This is a great opportunity for them to go up against the best teams in the world and possibly set themselves up for success in 2026,\" Molinaro added.\n\nCopa America marks the first international tournament for new Canadian head coach Jesse Marsch, who succeeded John Herdman in October. Marsch, previously a club-level coach in Europe, faced an immediate test with friendlies against the Netherlands and France. Despite a 4-0 loss to the Netherlands, Canada rebounded with a surprising 0-0 draw against the second-ranked French team.\n\n\"To go up against the No. 2 team in the world and earn a draw in Bordeaux.... Considering Jesse Marsch has only been in charge for not even a month, I think it was an impressive result,\" Molinaro said.\n\nBrendan Dunlop, co-founder of Canadian Soccer Daily and radio commentator for Canada's Copa America games, praised Marsch's tactical acumen and ability to connect with players. Dunlop believes Marsch's approach will make the Canadian team more exciting and adaptable.\n\nThe tournament's opening match against Argentina and Messi, likely participating in his final international tournament, promises to be a significant challenge. Dunlop noted Messi's continued motivation and the strength of Argentina and Brazil as the tournament favorites, with Uruguay and Colombia also poised to compete strongly.\n\nFor Canada, the expectations are more modest. After a disappointing World Cup showing in Qatar, where they lost all three games and scored only one goal, Dunlop anticipates a more competitive performance in the Copa America. While a win against Argentina seems unlikely, Canada could achieve victories against Chile or Peru and possibly advance beyond the group stage.\n\n\"They'll go and make the country proud. It's definitely going to be a team worth watching and listening to,\" Dunlop concluded.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The team's recent successes have established them as a dominant force in international soccer.\n\nUnder Lionel Scaloni, Argentina secured the Copa America trophy in 2021, followed by a triumph in the 2022 World Cup. As the tournament approaches, Argentina will likely aim for a historic third consecutive international title.\n\nScaloni's impact on Argentina's national team cannot be overstated. Taking over the reins in 2018, he has revitalized the team, leading them to significant victories on the international stage. His tactical acumen and ability to foster a cohesive unit have been pivotal in Argentina's recent achievements.\n\nDespite his success, Scaloni's salary reflects a surprising disparity, La Opinion reveals. He earns $2.6 million annually, placing him sixth among the best-paid managers in South America.\n\nIn the financial hierarchy of coaches at the 2024 Copa America, Uruguay's Marcelo Bielsa leads the pack with an annual salary of $4 million. Bielsa has transformed Uruguay into a formidable force, making them serious contenders for the Copa America title. Then, Brazil's Dorival Junior follows closely, also earning around $4 million. Despite some criticism of his appointment, he remains a key figure in Brazil's quest for glory.\n\nRicardo Gareca, who now coaches the Chilean national team, earns $3.7 million. Gareca's reputation as a seasoned tactician precedes him. Therefore, his new role with Chile is seen as a fresh start for the team. Paraguay's Daniel Garnero and Venezuela's Fernando Batista each earn $3 million, reflecting the competitive salaries for top managerial talent in the region.\n\nBelow Scaloni in the pay scale are Ecuador's Felix Sanchez and Colombia's Nestor Lorenzo, both earning $2.4 million. Interestingly, Gregg Berhalter's $2.2 million salary is barely enough for ninth place, as Peru's Jorge Fossati receives $2 million, while Bolivia's Antonio Carlo Zago earns the least at $1.1 million.\n\nAs the 2024 Copa America approaches, the spotlight will not only be on star players like Vinicius, Messi, or even Pulisic, but also on the managers who command from the sidelines. Managers like Scaloni and Berhalter, despite their lower salaries, will be crucial in steering their teams through the tournament. Their strategic decisions, ability to motivate players, and tactical prowess will be under intense scrutiny.\n\nFor nations like Chile and Peru, now led by Ricardo Gareca and Jorge Fossati respectively, this tournament marks a significant evaluation of their progress under new management. Meanwhile, Gregg Berhalter, the USMNT manager, faces a crucial period for his future. One of the lowest-paid managers at the Copa America is under pressure following a disappointing 5-1 loss to Colombia. His ability to turn the team's fortunes around will be closely watched.\n\nHis squad will have one more chance to play against top teams in a tournament setting in the Copa America before the 2026 World Cup. Therefore, improving his team management skills is something he must demonstrate. A glance at the rosters reveals some astonishing talent. Still, there's a glaring gap between individual skill and team output.", "source": {"uri": "worldsoccertalk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Soccer Talk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

That's certainly the case with Lionel Messi's Argentina, who have an extremely high-quality supporting cast around the still-magical, soon-to-be-37-year-old. Among the best are longtime international sidekick Angel Di Maria, Manchester City striker Julian Alvarez, Liverpool midfielder Alexis Mac Allister and Aston Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez.\n\nBest matchup: Argentina's second group game against Chile will be a rematch of the 2016 final played in the United States. The current Chilean squad is a long way off from that group which upset Messi's team on penalties back then, but Alexis Sanchez will still be roaming the pitch as a potential Messi foil.\n\nHistory lesson: Defending champion Argentina's 15 Copa America titles are tied with Uruguay for the most in the history of the competition, which is the oldest in international soccer -- even predating the Olympic and World Cup tournaments.\n\nPlayers to watch: Beyond Messi, Sanchez and others we've already mentioned, Argentina teenager Alejandro Garnacho scored the Premier League Goal of the season for Manchester United. Canada's Alphonso Davies is considered one of the best left backs in the world and is a two-way weapon for his national team and Bayern Munich.\n\nUp Next: Frankly, it would be extremely surprising if Argentina doesn't progress from a relatively straightforward group. It would be less of a surprise if that means they face 2022 World Cup group foes Mexico in the second round if an unimpressive El Tri squad can't top Group B.\n\nGroup B\n\nThe teams: Mexico, Ecuador, Venezuela, Jamaica\n\nThe favorite: Oddsmakers have installed Mexico as the most likely team to top the group, and given the enormous Mexican-American population in the United States, they'll probably be playing with a home-field advantage in every game. But this is not a vintage El Tri side, and Ecuador in particular could wrest away the top spot. Jamaica also has a roster with several Premier League stars, but they have underachieved recently relative to their talent.\n\nBest Matchup: Mexico and Ecuador will meet on the final day of group B, and while each could've already booked their place in the next round, there should be plenty to play for anyway; namely, the potential right to avoid a quarterfinal clash with defending Copa America and World Cup champion Argentina, who still have that Messi guy.\n\nHistory Lesson: Mexico is by far the most frequent guest team to compete at Copa America and will be making its 11th appearance since 1993 in the traditional South American event. They've reached the semifinals an impressive five times and the final twice but haven't been beyond the quarters since 2001.\n\nPlayers to watch: Edson Alvarez quickly became one of West Ham's most important players after his move to the Premier League, and the defensive midfielder might be even more significant for El Tri's hopes. Chelsea's Enner Valencia is another world-class central midfielder who will pull the strings for Ecuador. Veteran striker and Alvarez's club teammate Michail Antonio can strike from anywhere in the attacking half for Jamaica.\n\nUp Next: As mentioned before, finishing top of the group here carries the prize of most likely avoiding Messi in the second round. It's anyone's guess whom the group winner could face though, with Canada, Peru and Chile all reasonable picks to finish second in Group A.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

Their first introduction won't be easy.\n\nThere was beauty, and there was pain for Canadian soccer fans during the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nAfter a historic qualification run (in which they pipped rivals USA to the top spot and reached the big stage for the first time in 36 years), there was a huge reality check.\n\nCanada certainly made an impression, but truly lacked experience and maturity -- two characteristics they still haven't quite mastered.\n\nSince the World Cup, they lost the CONCACAF Nations League final to the USA and drew against both Guadeloupe and Guatemala in the Gold Cup. They later imploded against Jamaica in the CONCACAF Nations League quarters and needed to face Trinidad and Tobago via a playoff to even reach the Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\nThere may be light at the end of the tunnel, though, with a new manager and new general secretary/CEO. Add to that the individual development of star players over the last two years.\n\nWill Canada finally establish themselves as men and not boys?\n\nSome of the aforementioned struggles weren't under former boss John Herdman, who moved to coach Toronto FC in late August. Canada worked with interim coach Mauro Biello to qualify for the Copa Am\u00e9rica before ultimately announcing American Jesse Marsch as the new permanent head coach.\n\nHis appointment came just over one month before the team's headline tournament opener against Argentina. To prepare on such short notice, Canada booked two high-level friendlies.\n\nMarsch's first game in charge ended in a 4-0 thumping to the Netherlands (however, it was goalless at half-time). Next was a much, much better result, as they held European superpower France to a 0-0 draw. The teams had the same passing accuracy (89%) and almost the same number of passes (France led 521 to 513).\n\nThe ex-Leeds United boss still needs to tweak the attack, though. Under his guidance, Canada only registered two shots on target in their first 180 minutes.\n\nStill, Marsch has instilled some missing confidence in this squad despite limited time knowing them. The result against France will act as a huge motivator for the Copa Am\u00e9rica. What exactly is to come of this new era is yet to be determined.\n\nIt was a struggle to get here, but Canadians nationwide were in awe after finding out the Canucks would face Argentina in the Copa Am\u00e9rica, let alone a tournament opener.\n\nBut can they actually go toe-to-toe with the best in the world? La Albiceleste are notably the reigning World Cup champions and Copa Am\u00e9rica holders. This is as big as it gets.\n\nTalk about a dream opportunity. And what weight it would carry not only throughout the tournament but across the footballing world if they can pull off any result against the World No. 1. France first, Argentina next?\n\nNo ifs, ands, or buts; the pressure lies on Alphonso Davies (Bayern Munich), Jonathan David (Lille), Stephen Eust\u00e1quio (Porto), Alistair Johnston (Celtic), Tajon Buchanan (Inter Milan), and company. But a few other names are ready to share the limelight.\n\nWatford's 22-year-old midfielder Isma\u00ebl Kon\u00e9 comes to mind. The youngster was heavily relied upon by the Championship side with seven goal contributions from 42 league appearances last year. He's integrated into the national team with ease, too.\n\nAnother name from England's second tier is Liam Millar. The Preston North End winger registered five goals and five assists in 35 league games in 2023/24. He brought a much-needed spark against France, seeing a long-range effort hit the woodwork.\n\nThen don't forget about the Major League Soccer crew. Maxime Cr\u00e9peau (Portland Timbers) and Dayne St. Clair (Minnesota United) battle for first-choice goalkeeper. Mo\u00efse Bombito (Colorado Rapids) and Jacob Shaffelburg (Nashville SC) are also turning into fan favourites.\n\nMarsch will obviously still be tinkering with his preferred starting XI after just two games in charge, but there's an honest selection headache in front of him.\n\nIf you haven't watched this Canadian side before, well, they play with a chip on their shoulder. Perhaps that's because Canada is widely known globally as only a hockey country,\n\nCanada loves the underdog tag, so when they face their opponents, they say, 'Bring it on' in full force. But is that tag enough to inspire them during this tournament?\n\nAfter the semi-disastrous World Cup and with the Copa Am\u00e9rica arriving on the eve of hosting the next World Cup, how the Canucks perform against quality opposition is crucial.\n\nThe 48th-ranked country has come a long way. But it's time to actually play the game at the required level and not rely solely on attitude, grit, and skyrocketing mood levels if things go their way.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com",

Let's enjoy them now, we'll see what happens later. Messi is fine, he's happy. I'm with renewed ideas and strength. It's a nice challenge to defend the title,\" he said.\n\nScaloni said he has a full strength side to pick from for the opening game against Jesse Marsch's Canada.\n\nChelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez underwent a hernia operation in April but returned to action in the World Cup winners' recent friendlies against Ecuador and Guatemala and Scaloni said he is ready to go.\n\n\"We'll see if he plays tomorrow but he is in condition to start,\" the Argentine coach told a news conference where he appeared alongside midfielder Leandro Paredes.\n\nScaloni hinted that AS Roma midfielder Paredes is likely to start however and said that while he was keeping his starting eleven to himself, he had made his mind up.\n\n\"I have the line-up, I have no doubts. I'm going to give it to them this afternoon, they don't know yet. They're all available for tomorrow's game, the ones we think are the best will play,\" he said.\n\n\"I could be wrong, but we always think about putting out the best. With me, whoever is best always plays. Paredes had to come off in the first game of the World Cup because we thought there were other guys who were better. And there's a reason why I have him next to me now,\" said Scaloni.\n\nShould Scaloni start with Fernandez on the bench his midfield trio is likely to be made up of Rodrigo De Paul, Paredes and Alexis Mac Allister\n\nArgentina have started their CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying campaign positively with five wins out of six games but Scaloni said he was looking forward to match-ups with teams from outside of South America.\n\nThis edition of the Copa America features six teams from the CONCACAF region with Argentina facing Canada as well as Chile and Peru in Group A.\n\nWhile the USA and Mexico are traditionally the strongest teams from CONCACAF, Scaloni said he has been impressed by Canada's progress.\n\n\"They have a very good team, with important players and a new coach who has brought new ideas.

There's certainly photos of the Manchester City icon with some goats, though there's no other Argentinian players to be found. The whole thing is of course a publicity stunt, arranged by gambling company Stake.com.\n\nThe whole thing is a play on the term 'GOAT', an acronym for 'Greatest Of All Time', which Stake wisely precede with 'one of the' when talking about Aguero given he played alongside the superior Lionel Messi.\n\nWhy England Dominated Serbia (And Then Why They Didn't)\n\nAguero said: \"I've played with the GOAT, and it was great to spend the day with some more of his kind! If Argentina can win Copa America, then they can cement their legacy as one of the Greatest Teams of All Time.\"\n\nArgentina will be looking to defend their Copa America crown having won the tournament in 2021, with Angel Di Maria scoring the only goal of the game in the final against Brazil. They will kick off this year's campaign by facing Canada, Chile and Peru in the group stage.\n\nOn his country's prospects, Aguero said: \"Argentina is always a candidate... but, pressure? I don't think so. I think we're used to this. Now, it's about preserving the style and team concept we've developed. We won what we've won because of this.\n\n\"The players that were part of that process should pass it on to the newcomers. It's great that it happens naturally. The national squad is richer for all the new talent, and they'll keep growing because of this.\"\n\nNow plying his trade for Inter Miami, Messi will be in familiar surroundings at Argentina's Florida base, which Argentina also used to warm up for a pre-World Cup friendly in 2022 before going on to win the tournament. Hey, why change a winning formula?\n\nAguero added: \"There's a big expat community in Miami of Argentinians, and many other Latin Americans who support our side.\n\n\"With Leo playing [for] the local Inter [Miami], that sentiment grows even more. But there are a lot of Mexicans, Colombians, Venezuelans too.\n\n\"We can say that Miami is likely the place with the most people rooting for different teams of Copa America at least.\"\n\nAguero retired in 2021 shortly after leaving City and having a half-season spell at Barcelona that was curtailed after he suffered a cardiac arrhythmia that led doctors to advise him to hang up his boots.\n\nWe have a rundown of all the squads at the 2024 Copa America, and a more detailed look at the Argentina side that are looking to hold on to the trophy.", "source": {"uri": "fourfourtwo.com",

Thursday's Copa opener is nevertheless sold out for the clash between one of the best teams in the world and a Canadian squad led by recently hired American Manager Jesse Marsch.\n\nArgentina vs. Canada Copa America Odds\n\nThe reigning World Cup champs are the clear favorites to win this tournament, so it's no surprise that they're heavily favored in the first match of the Copa America.\n\nCanada boasts a few stars including Bayern Munich's Alphonso Davies, who is captaining the squad at just 23 years old, but appears overmatched against Argentina. La Albiceleste return every key contributor from the lineup that won the World Cup two years ago.\n\nArgentina vs. Canada Over/Under\n\nAt BetMGM, the Over/Under in Argentina vs. Canada is set at 2.5 (Over -145, Under +105), while FanDuel also has the total at 2.5 (Over -138, Under +112) and DK prices Over 2.5 at -145 and Under 2.5 at +115.\n\nThe total being set at just 2.5 shows that oddsmakers expect a shutout, which makes how many goals Argentina will score the biggest question. In fact, at DraftKings, the Both Teams to Score prop pays out at \"Yes\" (+125), \"No\" -155, while the Argentina Win to Zero prop is not cheap at -135.\n\nOne other example of DraftKings' confidence in the Argentina back line is apparent in the Canada: Team Total Goals -- Over 0.5 (+100); Under 0.5 (-135).\n\nA few fun props to consider whenever eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi takes the pitch are his goal-scorer markets. For Thursday, FanDuel's Anytime Goalscorer (ATGS) market prices Messi at -115, while BetMGM lists him at -130, with DK's Messi ATGS price set at -125. Obviously, if this is where you're looking -- and who can blame you -- FD offers the best bang for your buck on this play.\n\nAnd if you're looking for a bigger payout, take a look at playing Messi First Time Goal Scorer (+260 at BetMGM; +270 at DraftKings; +280 at FanDuel). FanDuel also offers props for player hat tricks -- a successful play on that bold swing would pay out at +1800.\n\nLautaro Martinez, Julian Alvarez Goal Scorer Props\n\nOther interesting ATGS options include Argentina forwards Lautaro Martinez (+115 at DK; +110 at BetMGM) and Julian Alvarez (+145 at DK; +140 at BetMGM).\n\nThe fact that the Canadian with the shortest ATGS odds is Jonathan David at nearly 4-to-1 (+370 at DK; +375 at BetMGM) illustrates how one-sided this match-up looks as well as any betting market for this game.\n\nArgentina vs. Canada Betting Analysis, Picks\n\nWhen the underdog is as long as +1100, that leaves little to break down as far as who will win and why.\n\nThe more compelling questions for Thursday night appear to be, \"How long can Canada keep it close?\" and \"Will Argentina pour it on if it builds an early lead?\"\n\nIn the last major competition where we saw Argentina, Manager Jorge Vilda's team played seven matches in the 2022 World Cup, going 4-2-1 in 90 minutes (obviously, it won both \"draws\" -- against the Netherlands in the quarters and, memorably, against France in the final). Of Argentina's four wins in 2022, just one came by a margin of more than two goals.\n\nThis year's team could very well show a lot more interest in blowing teams out, but for the opener, Canada seemingly has a chance to keep the final score respectable.\n\nWith that in mind, below are a couple conservative plays that offer odds long enough for a solid payout. The first play here cashes as long as Argentina has a lead at halftime and Canada has not scored by the time the teams head to the locker rooms.\n\nBetting Picks: 1st Half -- Argentina to win and Canada not to score (-110) BetMGM; Half Time/Full Time -- Argentina/Argentina (-110) BetMGM", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyler_everett@newsweek.com", "name": "Tyler Everett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FanDuel", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FanDuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM_Resorts_International", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MGM Resorts International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonso_Davies", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphonso Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports_1", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_David", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan David"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2413455/argentina-canada-copa-america.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658543", "eventUri": "eng-9658543", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Clubs like Ipswich Town, Southampton, Leicester City, Everton, and Brentford have no players representing their countries at the tournament.\n\nDomestic football is all well and good - but for footballers, there is no better feeling than representing your country. The majority of players are continually snubbed by their respective nations, meaning that just a handful are given the opportunity to play at a major tournament - most notably, the World Cup or European Championships.\n\nThere is the Copa America, too, which typically goes under the radar. Nations from across North and South America go to battle this summer in the United States, with reigning champions Argentina looking to retain their title.\n\nWith the Premier League finished for the summer and all focus now on the respective summer tournaments - Euro 2024 included - which players from the top tier are heading to Copa America this summer?\n\nIn total, there are 41 stars heading to the United States this summer and one club boasts five of them but, for reference, there are no players from Ipswich Town, Southampton, Leicester City, Everton and Brentford that have been picked to represent their country at this summer's tournament.\n\nOne Player Manchester City Close\n\nAt club level, there is uncertainty over Julian Alvarez's future with him linked with a move to Chelsea, but what is for certain is that he'll be in the United States throughout the summer being utilised in all manner of constellations by Lionel Scaloni.\n\nThe forward, who plays for Manchester City, has proven time and time again why his employers are lucky to have him - and despite playing second fiddle to none other than Erling Haaland, his 2023/24 return of 11 goals and nine assists is commendable.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: The last Argentina matchday squad not to include Julian Alvarez was in October 2021.\n\nPotentially looking to secure a switch away from the Etihad Stadium in the coming months, the 2000-born magician, valued at \u00a380 million, will be hoping to enjoy a summer of glory with his compatriots - the same roster of players who were crowned World Cup champions in 2022.\n\nOne Player - Copa America 2024\n\nClub\n\nPlayer\n\nManchester City\n\nJulian Alvarez\n\nTwo Players Newcastle United, Manchester United, Chelsea, Bournemouth, Arsenal Close\n\nBrazilian duo Gabriel Martinelli and Gabriel Magalhaes are the two from Arsenal's roster to get the call-up this summer, while Gabriel Jesus misses out after a poor season by his own standards.\n\nBruno Guimaraes' representatives could continue to scour for potential would-be buyers while their client is attempting to help guide Brazil, alongside the aforementioned Arsenal duo, to glory in the United States. His colleague, Miguel Almiron, will be plying his trade for Paraguay with him likely to hit the 60-cap international mark.\n\nRelated 12 Top Scorers in Copa America History (Ranked) Some of the best South American players in history have lit up the continental competition. Here's a rundown of the Copa America's leading scorers.\n\nOn the back of a difficult season on the south coast for Bournemouth, USMNT captain Tyler Adams will be spotted leading his compatriots out to battle this summer, with assistant coach B.J. Callaghan insisting that he is \"looking fit\" ahead of the tournament.\n\nChelsea's two \u00a3100 million plus midfielders, Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez, will be representing Colombia and Argentina, respectively. The latter, after helping his nation lift glory in Qatar two years ago, will be vying for another piece of silverware to add to his bow.\n\nFor Manchester United, Argentine duo Lisandro Martinez and Alejandro Garnacho are both on the plane for La Albiceleste. The latter enjoyed a glittering campaign in an otherwise turbulent Red Devils side, notching 15 goal contributions (ten goals, five assists) in 50 appearances across all competitions, while the former struggled for fitness.\n\nTwo Players - Copa America 2024\n\nClub\n\nPlayers\n\nArsenal\n\nGabriel Magalhaes (Brazil), Gabriel Martinelli (Brazil)\n\nBournemouth\n\nLuis Sinisterra (Colombia), Tyler Adams (USMNT)\n\nChelsea\n\nEnzo Fernandez (Argentina), Moises Caicedo (Ecuador)\n\nManchester United\n\nAlejandro Garnacho (Argentina), Lisandro Martinez (Argentina)\n\nNewcastle United\n\nBruno Guimaraes (Brazil), Miguel Almiron (Paraguay)\n\nThree Players West Ham United, Tottenham Hotspur, Crystal Palace, Aston Villa Close\n\nFour of the Premier League's 20 clubs have three players that will rack up further international caps this summer at the competition's 48th instalment: West Ham United, Tottenham Hotspur, Crystal Palace and Aston Villa. Douglas Luiz has an important summer ahead. Not only can he help lead Brazil to glory but a switch to Juventus could also be on the horizon. The midfielder is a menace from 12 yards out, too, which could prove valuable in the coming weeks.\n\nEmiliano Martinez, one of the best goalkeepers in the world, and Jhon Duran are also going. From Crystal Palace's revitalised squad, thanks to the appointment of Oliver Glasner, Colombian duo Daniel Munoz and Jefferson Lerma will most likely be mainstays in Los Cafeteros' Copa America campaign, while Chris Richards will provide the USMNT with defensive solidity.\n\nRelated USA's Road to the Copa America Final The USA host the 2024 Copa America and they will be hoping to reach the latter stages of the tournament.\n\nWest Ham's Michail Antonio will be, despite being born in London, representing Jamaica this summer, having scored three goals in 12 outings for the Caribbean-based nation. His colleagues Edson Alvarez and Lucas Paqueta will be there, too, for Mexico and Brazil, respectively.\n\nTottenham Hotspur have enjoyed something of a resurgence under Ange Postecoglou - and, as a result, have three players from their north London squad heading to the United States in the coming week. Cristiano Romero, Giovanni Lo Celso and Rodrigo Bentancur will all be spending their off-season with a trophy in mind.\n\nThree Players - Copa America 2024\n\nClub\n\nPlayers\n\nAston Villa\n\nDouglas Luiz (Brazil), Emiliano Martinez (Argentina), Jhon Duran (Colombia)\n\nCrystal Palace\n\nChris Richards (USMNT), Daniel Munoz (Colombia), Jefferson Lerma (Colombia)\n\nTottenham\n\nCristian Romero (Argentina), Giovanni Lo Celso (Argentina), Rodrigo Bentancur (Uruguay)\n\nWest Ham\n\nEdson Alvarez (Mexico), Lucas Paqueta (Brazil), Michail Antonio (Jamaica)\n\nFour Players Wolverhampton Wanderers, Nottingham Forest, Liverpool, Brighton Close\n\nTo have four players representing your club at an international tournament is no mean feat, but Wolverhampton Wanderers, Nottingham Forest, Liverpool and Brighton & Hove Albion can hold their heads high with them watching a quartet of their players going to the United States this summer.\n\nFrom a Wolves perspective, Manchester United-linked Joao Gomes will be looking to impressive as a means of bumping up interest in his signature with a career-defining move inevitably around the corner. Liverpool's Alexis Mac Allister, on the back of a fruitful inaugural season with his current employers, will be on hand in the centre of the park to keep things compact for Argentina, while the Reds' primary shot stopper Allison Becker is on the plane for Brazil.\n\nRelated Every Winner in Copa America History GIVEMESPORT provides a detailed breakdown of every winner in Copa America history.\n\nGiven the competition from Manchester City's Ederson, whether the 31-year-old will get much game time, however, remains to be seen. Someone who is likely to play the majority of his nation's minutes is Liverpool and Uruguay sensation Darwin Nunez.\n\nBrighton also have four players heading to the United States this summer. The young and relatively inexperienced trio of Argentina's Valentin Barco and Julio Enciso alongside Ecuador's Jeremy Sarmiento will be looking to stake a claim on their respective squads.\n\nFour Players - Copa America 2024\n\nClub\n\nPlayers\n\nBrighton\n\nJeremy Sarmiento (Ecuador), Julio Enciso (Argentina), Tom McGill (Canada), Valentin Barco (Argentina)\n\nLiverpool\n\nAlexis Mac Allister (Argentina), Alisson (Brazil), Darwin Nunez (Uruguay), Luis Diaz (Colombia)\n\nNottingham Forest\n\nBrandon Aguilera (Costa Rica), Giovanni Reyna (USMNT), Gonzalo Montiel (Argentina), Matt Turner (USMNT)\n\nWolves\n\nDexter Lembikisa (Jamaica), Joao Gomes (Brazil), Santiago Bueno (Uruguay), Yerson Mosquera (Colombia)\n\nFive Players Fulham Close\n\nInterestingly, Fulham are the only club from the Premier League to have a quintet of players going to Copa America: Antonee Robinson and Tim Ream of USMNT, Brazil's Andreas Pereira, Canada ace Luc de Fougerolles and Jamaican talisman Bobby Decordova-Reid, many of whom are attracting interest in the off-season period.\n\nAn undeniable moment of joy and pride for the west London-based outfit, the likes of Robinson and Decordova-Reid could be the difference-makers for their respective nations once the competition gets underway. Robinson, alongside Ream, will form one half of the USMNT defence and will lean on their experience working together in England's top flight in order to boost their chances of reigning supreme on home soil.\n\nFive Players - Copa America 2024\n\nClub\n\nPlayers\n\nFulham\n\nAntonee Robinson (USMNT), Andreas Pereira (Brazil), Bobby Decordova-Reid (Jamaica), Luc de Fougerolles (Canada), Tim Ream

Others are lesser known outside their countries, and Copa America will give them a chance to showcase their skills to fans and scouts all over the world.\n\nThe Inter Miami star and eight-time Ballon d'Or winner felt a giant load lifted off his shoulders when Argentina won the 2022 World Cup, as that trophy was the only one missing from his illustrious resume. But he wants more and would love to see Argentina defend its Copa America title. He turns 37 on June 24 and has Miami in first place in the MLS standings with 12 goals and 13 assists in 12 games.\n\nMiguel Terceros (BOLIVIA)\n\nIf you're looking for an up-and-coming player to watch, keep an eye on this 20-year-old Santos midfielder they call \"Miguelito.\" La Verde will miss retired Marcelo Martins Moreno, But Terceros is entertaining and has plenty of upside.\n\nVinicius Junior (BRAZIL)\n\nSuperstar Neymar is injured, so Vinicius Junior will take center stage for Brazil. The 23-year-old Real Madrid forward, known for his speed and dribbling, became the youngest player to score in two Champions League finals, beating Lionel Messi's record by 13 days. He also was named the UEFA Champions League Player of the Season with six goals and five assists. He also is known for his anti-racism activism. P.S. Watch out for 17-year-old left-footed striker Endrick, who will join Real Madrid next season and scored for Brazil in a friendly against England at Wembley in March.\n\nAlphonso Davies (CANADA)\n\nThe only Canadian ever to score in a World Cup, Davies is a team captain and the face of Canadian soccer. The 23-year-old Bayern Munich defender is a top-10 scorer for Canada, has five Bundesliga titles, a Champions League title and Club World Cup trophy.\n\nDario Osorio (CHILE)\n\nLeft-footed winger was a key player for Danish champions Midtjylland and scored a late goal in a friendly against France. Chile won Copa America in 2015 and 2016, and Osorio is among the new players who could bring them back to glory.\n\nLuis Diaz (COLOMBIA)\n\nParticipating in his third Copa America for Los Cafeteros. In 2021, the Liverpool winger scored four times (including goals against host Brazil and eventual champ Argentina) and finished tied with Messi as joint top scorer in the Copa America. He scored against Germany in a 2-0 friendly win last June and recorded a brace as Colombia beat Brazil 2-1 in World Cup qualification in November.\n\nManfred Ugalde (COSTA RICA)\n\nHe is usually the smallest man on the field at 5-8 and 150 pounds, but he packs a big punch. At 22, the former teen phenom and Spartak Moscow forward is ready to make international headlines for Los Ticos.\n\nMoises Caicedo (ECUADOR)\n\nChelsea paid Brighton $146 million dollars to sign Caicedo, a 22-year-old defensive midfielder who is considered one of the best players in the world at his position. Liverpool was also courting him. He made 48 appearances for Chelsea and is one reason Ecuador could pull surprises during this tournament.\n\nMichaeil Antonio (JAMAICA)\n\nThe 34-year-old West Ham forward was born in England but represents Jamaica. In 2021, he became West Ham's all-time leading scorer. He is known for his versatility, as he has played right back, right midfielder, winger and forward for West Ham.\n\nSantiago \"Santi\" Gimenez (MEXICO)\n\nIn 2023, a year after being dropped from the Mexican World Cup team, the 23-year-old Argentina-born forward led Feyenoord to its second Dutch title this century with 15 goals in 32 games. This season, he scored 23 goals and the team finished in second place. Last July, he scored in the 88th minute to lift Mexico to a 1-0 victory over Panama in the CONCACAF Gold Cup final.\n\nAdalberto \"Coco\" Carrasquilla (PANAMA)\n\nMajor League Soccer fans know Carrasquilla as a talented, creative Houston Dynamo midfielder, and the 25-year-old is already a mainstay on the Panama team. He will be one of the bright spots for a team that will have trouble advancing.\n\nMiguel Almiron (PARAGUAY)\n\nAfter helping lead Atlanta United to the 2018 Cup title, Almiron commanded an MLS record transfer fee from Newcastle of the English Premier League. He has played games for the Magpies, scoring a career-best 11 goals last season to help the club qualify for the Champions League for the first time in two decades.\n\nEdison Flores (PERU)\n\nWith 16 goals in 73 appearances, Peru will count on Flores. He participated at the 2018 FIFA World Cup and was the joint top scorer for Peru in the qualifiers. He plays forward for Peruvian Liga 1 club Universitario de Deportes, on loan from Liga MX club Atlas. He previously played for D.C. United.\n\nChristian Pulisic (USA)\n\nThe face of the U.S. national team, Pulisic, nicknamed \"Captain America,\" is in peak form after his first year in Italy with AC Milan. The 25-year-old winger has scored a career-high 12 goals across all competitions with two months of the Serie A season remaining. He previously spent four years with Chelsea of the English Premier League and three with Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund.\n\nDarwin Nunez (URUGUAY)\n\nEdison Cavani retired and 37-year-old Inter Miami forward Luis Suarez, Uruguay's all-time leading scorer, will be a locker room leader. But 24-year-old Darwin Nunez, making his Copa America debut, is the player to watch. Liverpool paid a record transfer fee to get him from Benfica two years ago and he has scored 33 goals over all competitions for the club. He scored a hat trick last week in a 4-0 Copa tune-up win over Mexico and five goals in World Cup qualifying against Colombia, Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia (2).\n\nSalomon Rondon (VENEZUELA)\n\nThe 34-year-old is on fire, leading Mexican club Pachuca to the CONCACAF Champions Cup title with nine goals in seven games. He has 10 goals in 21 Liga MX games and will be a handful for defenders.", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The likes of Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and tournament hosts United States will battle it out for the North and South American crown this summer.\n\nAfter winning the previous tournament and then the World Cup in 2022, Argentina are looking to maintain their intercontinental dominance, while the other big hitters in the competition attempt to knock Lionel Messi and Co. off of their thrown.\n\nManchester United will be represented at the tournament, which takes place across 14 cities in the USA. GOAL shows how you can follow each of the Old Trafford heroes present at the Copa America.\n\nManchester United's official hotel loyalty partner, Marriott Bonvoy, brings Reds around the world closer to their biggest passion in its latest series, United: Near & Far. If you travel to watch United players in action in the United States, Marriott Bonvoy has a hotel experience for you.\n\nAt just 19 years old, Alejandro Garnacho is already a first-team regular for Manchester United. Coming off the back of a season in which he won the FA Cup and made 50 appearances in all competitions, the winger will hope coach Lionel Scaloni gives him the chance to add to the five senior caps he already has to his name.\n\nGarnacho will aim to put in a good showing if called upon when his side come up against Canada in their first game at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia on June 20.\n\nHe will also hope to have more chances to shine when they travel to the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey to meet Chile on June 25, and then four days later they have a match against Peru at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.\n\nHaving endured a season plagued by injury, Lisandro Martinez returned to action at the end of the campaign, right on time to help guide Erik ten Hag's team to FA Cup success and book his place in Scaloni's squad.\n\nHis appearance in their pre-tournament warm-up game against Ecuador was his first Argentina outing in over a year, suggesting Scaloni is eager to put him in the starting XI during the Copa America beside Cristian Romero.\n\nShould he help Argentina through the first round as Group A winners, he and his co-stars will travel to Houston, Texas to face the runners-up of Group B, which will be either Mexico, Ecuador, Venezuela or Jamaica. If Argentina finish second in their pool, they will go to Arlington, Texas to face the winner of Group B.\n\nFacundo Pellistri spent the second half of the 2023-24 season on loan at Granada, having joined the club in the January transfer window.\n\nAfter making nine Premier League appearances for Man Utd in the first half of the campaign, he immediately became a key figure for Granada and went on to score two goals and register two assists in 15 matches.\n\nThe 22-year-old did enough during 2023-24 to secure a place in Marcelo Bielsa's Uruguay squad for the competition in the United States and he will be confident of being a starter after scoring and assisting goals in their 4-0 win against Mexico.\n\nHe will hope to be given the nod when they line up against Panama at Miami Gardens, Florida on June 23 in their opening Group C clash. Four days later, they come up against Bolivia in East Rutherford, New Jersey before rounding off the group stage with a game against United States in Kansas City, Missouri on July 1.", "source":

The United States will host, Canada make their tournament bow, while Mexico will appear for a record fifth time as invited guests ahead of the World Cup in North America in 2026.\n\nWe could also have a new oldest player, a second-youngest goalscorer, and an undisputed record title holder, with two of the tournament favourites tied on 15 Copa America crowns apiece.\n\nThe Athletic dives into all the numbers, whether revealing, random or downright ridiculous.\n\nHow to follow the Copa America and European Championship on The Athletic...\n\nPlenty of South America's iconic figures will surely be playing their final international tournament this summer, while others have already missed the cut. Chile's Arturo Vidal, Colombia's Radamel Falcao, Uruguay's Edinson Cavani and Brazil's Thiago Silva are just a handful of names who will not be representing their countries in the States after decades of loyal service.\n\nPeru and Chile, two of the most successful Copa America sides throughout the 2010s, will defend their excellent recent records with the oldest squads in the competition. At an average age of 29.1 years, even without Yoshimar Yotun (128 caps) and Renato Tapia (85 caps), five of Peru's 10 most-capped players will be vying for their place in the starting XI.\n\nZooming out and a glance through the older names on the squad lists feels like a trip down memory lane, with big-hitters Luis Suarez, Lionel Messi, Angel Di Maria and Alexis Sanchez all likely to say their emotional goodbyes to competitive international football in July.\n\nThose are not the only notable names; 40-year-old Paolo Guerrero needs just three goals to equal the all-time scoring record at the Copa America, while Messi is only four behind and needs just one more game to break Sergio Livingstone's record of 34 appearances at the competition that has stood for 70 years.\n\nGoalkeeper Claudio Bravo will become the oldest player in tournament history, heavily favoured by new Chile head coach Ricardo Gareca despite over seven months without an appearance at club level for Real Betis. At 41 years, two months and 16 days, there are 10 players available for selection this summer who were not even born when Bravo made his international debut in 2004.\n\nA word for the CONCACAF nations, too. Joel Campbell is still only 31 years old but will break the 140-cap barrier for Costa Rica in Group D, one of the last remaining players from their historic World Cup run in 2014 after Keylor Navas announced his shock retirement in May.\n\nSuch generational change is reflected in the squad-wide data; Gustavo Alfaro's side boasts the youngest average age of any team ahead of the tournament at just 24.7 years, with 13 players aged 23 or below -- more than any other nation this summer.\n\nThere are two outstanding youngsters to keep an eye on this summer and both could have big roles to play.\n\nChelsea-bound Kendry Paez is fearless and fizzing with confidence, a fleet-footed dribbler who loves to cut inside onto his left foot and strike from distance. He has already scored and assisted for his country in World Cup qualifying, plays a starring role for Independiente del Valle, and will be a key spark for an Ecuador side struggling to consistently create at the sharp end of the pitch.\n\nSome nine months ahead of his development path is Endrick, who now has three goals in four substitute appearances for Brazil, including winners against England and Mexico. He will be pushing for a starting berth, but for now, both his instinctive finishing ability and frightening bursts of acceleration and power around the box are game-breakers against tired legs.\n\nFurther down the list, there is lots of excitement surrounding Chile's Dario Osorio, an elusive winger with a thumping left-footed strike, while Brighton's Julio Enciso, despite a six-month meniscus injury, may have to shoulder the attacking responsibility for his native Paraguay, who have scored just twice in their last nine games.\n\nTalk about a baptism of fire.\n\nNot only current holders and reigning World Champions, Argentina are also the most experienced nation based on the average number of caps per player in the squad.\n\nGranted, that average is pulled up slightly by Lionel Messi, whose 182 caps for his country are more than any other player in the tournament this summer.\n\nFellow 36-year-olds Angel Di Maria and Nicolas Otamendi also boost their nation's average, with 140 and 112 caps respectively, completing the trio of Argentina players with 100-plus caps. Only Chile, with four centurions in the side, have more.\n\nBrazil are surprisingly light on the caps front; their record appearance maker is Marquinhos, with 85. Otherwise, 23 of the 26 players selected have fewer than 50 caps, while 15 have fewer than 10.\n\nThey are the outliers in a group of the five least experienced sides, all rank outsiders to progress. Bolivia have won one game in their last seven Copa Americas, a 3-2 win over Ecuador in 2016, which is also their only competitive win away from their high-altitude fortress in La Paz in the past 29 years.\n\nArgentina and Uruguay are tied on 15 titles each, six clear of Brazil, and both look more than capable of going all the way.\n\nGoals are what we are really here for, aren't they?\n\nWe want to see the best players scoring the best goals on the international stage, so it is worth looking at who is the most prolific for their country among all players in the tournament.\n\nThat player is... Messi.\n\nThe best player on the planet will be familiar with football in the United States since his move to Inter Miami in July 2023 and he will more than likely add to his tally of 108 Argentina goals this summer to become the outright second-most prolific international player in men's international football history.\n\nJonathan David's numbers stack up well with some of the continent's legendary strikers, with seven of the players in the graphic above (Messi, Suarez, Enner Valencia, Cyle Larin, Salomon Rondon, Guerrero and Sanchez) starting the tournament as their nation's record goal scorers.\n\nThere are plenty of players who know how to find the back of the net.\n\nYou would be forgiven for being slightly out of the loop on the Copa America's head coaches -- 11 of them have been in the job for less than 18 months.\n\nThe most recent appointment of all was that of Jesse Marsch, hired as Canada boss just 39 days before their tournament opener against Argentina. He is one of three former Leeds United managers in the tournament, along with Marcelo Bielsa of Uruguay and Thomas Christiansen of Panama.\n\nCuriously, seven of the 16 managers at the tournament are Argentinian, while four are over 60 years of age -- Peru's Jorge Fossati is the oldest at 71 and is affectionately named \"El Nonno\" or \"The Grandfather\", while Dorival Junior has managed 12 of the 20 sides currently in the Brazilian top flight.\n\nWhat they lack in experience on the pitch, they more than make up for on the sidelines.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news",

The decision was announced last year as a part of a strategic agreement between the CONMEBOL, the South American Football Confederation, and the Concacaf, the North/Central American and Caribbean soccer federation, to develop the sport ahead of the 2024 World Cup, also to be hosted in North America. The other reason is simple: money.\n\nCopa vs. Euro. Despite being the world's oldest soccer tournament, Copa America has long struggled to escape the shadow of its younger brother, the Euros, for a few reasons. It features fewer teams (16) than its European cousin (24), and the same few teams - Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay - often dominate, making it less competitive overall. Also, while the region is home to some of the world's best players - Messi, Pele, Maradona, Di St\u00e9fano - it's a more concentrated talent pool than Europe.\n\nThe Euro also outpaces the Copa in scale, money, and publicity - in a day, for example, French superstar Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 made headlines for political activism, a broken nose, and his team's first Euro match win.

That's certainly the case with Lionel Messi's Argentina, who have an extremely high-quality supporting cast around the still-magical, soon-to-be-37-year-old. Among the best are longtime international sidekick Angel Di Maria, Manchester City striker Julian Alvarez, Liverpool midfielder Alexis Mac Allister and Aston Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez.\n\nBest matchup: Argentina's second group game against Chile will be a rematch of the 2016 final played in the United States. The current Chilean squad is a long way off from that group which upset Messi's team on penalties back then, but Alexis Sanchez will still be roaming the pitch as a potential Messi foil.\n\nHistory lesson: Defending champion Argentina's 15 Copa America titles are tied with Uruguay for the most in the history of the competition, which is the oldest in international soccer -- even predating the Olympic and World Cup tournaments.\n\nPlayers to watch: Beyond Messi, Sanchez and others we've already mentioned, Argentina teenager Alejandro Garnacho scored the Premier League Goal of the season for Manchester United. Canada's Alphonso Davies is considered one of the best left backs in the world and is a two-way weapon for his national team and Bayern Munich.\n\nUp Next: Frankly, it would be extremely surprising if Argentina doesn't progress from a relatively straightforward group. It would be less of a surprise if that means they face 2022 World Cup group foes Mexico in the second round if an unimpressive El Tri squad can't top Group B.\n\nThe favorite: Oddsmakers have installed Mexico as the most likely team to top the group, and given the enormous Mexican-American population in the United States, they'll probably be playing with a home-field advantage in every game. But this is not a vintage El Tri side, and Ecuador in particular could wrest away the top spot. Jamaica also has a roster with several Premier League stars, but they have underachieved recently relative to their talent.\n\nBest Matchup: Mexico and Ecuador will meet on the final day of group B, and while each could've already booked their place in the next round, there should be plenty to play for anyway; namely, the potential right to avoid a quarterfinal clash with defending Copa America and World Cup champion Argentina, who still have that Messi guy.\n\nHistory Lesson: Mexico is by far the most frequent guest team to compete at Copa America and will be making its 11th appearance since 1993 in the traditional South American event. They've reached the semifinals an impressive five times and the final twice but haven't been beyond the quarters since 2001.\n\nPlayers to watch: Edson Alvarez quickly became one of West Ham's most important players after his move to the Premier League, and the defensive midfielder might be even more significant for El Tri's hopes. Chelsea's Enner Valencia is another world-class central midfielder who will pull the strings for Ecuador. Veteran striker and Alvarez's club teammate Michail Antonio can strike from anywhere in the attacking half for Jamaica.\n\nUp Next: As mentioned before, finishing top of the group here carries the prize of most likely avoiding Messi in the second round. It's anyone's guess whom the group winner could face though, with Canada, Peru and Chile all reasonable picks to finish second in Group A.", "source": {"uri": "deadspin.com", "dataType": "news",

How offsides, penalties and red cards will be determined at CONMEBOL tournament in USA", "body": "The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) has become common in many top leagues and tournaments around the world.\n\nSince its introduction in 2016 in the Netherlands and in the U.S. second division league, USL, it's been adopted and used by leagues all over the globe. Having the use of video to judge incidents that happened too fast to see in real time has helped referees better officiate matches. But that doesn't mean it isn't without drawbacks.\n\nThe Premier League admitted earlier in 2024 that there had been 20 wrong VAR decisions, and there was an infamous misunderstanding in a game between Liverpool and Tottenham that led to an offside decision to stand on a legal goal by Luis Diaz.\n\nHowever, at least on the international level, VAR is here to stay and it's becoming more refined every year that it's being used. Does that mean we'll see it at the Copa America in the United States this year?\n\nMORE: When is Lionel Messi playing at Copa America?\n\nCONMEBOL, South America's soccer confederation, has confirmed that VAR will be in use for every match at Copa America 2024.\n\nEvery game will have a central referee, two assistants, a fourth official, and a video assistant referee team.\n\nThe use of VAR will follow the same brief as in club games and will be used to check for clear and obvious errors relating to goals, penalty incidents, red cards, and cases of mistaken identity.\n\nUnlike Euro 2024, there will be no semi-automated offside calls, and the goal-line technology will be simpler, with fewer cameras compared to the tournament in Germany and a watch vibration for the on-pitch referee as confirmation of the ball going over the line.\n\nBroadcasters from across the world will be showing the best action from the Copa America. Below are the key details on how to watch and stream matches in some of the major territories.\n\nUSA: Fox Sports will broadcast matches via their network of channels including FS1. Fubo is the place to go for US based fans looking to stream matches with the platform offering a FREE trial ahead of Copa America to new users.\n\nTUDN and Univision are the places to go for Spanish listeners looking for TV coverage, with Fubo and ViX live streaming options.\n\nCanada: TSN will broadcast matches with streaming options available on TSN+.\n\nFrench language channel RDS Sports will be providing the coverage this summer on both TV and streaming services.\n\nAustralia: Fans in Australia can follow all the Copa America2024 action live and on demand on Optus Sport.\n\nUK: Matches will be available on Premier Sports 1 and Premier Sports Play.\n\nIndia: Copa America matches will be available on Fan Code in India.\n\nIf Copa America 2024 is not available to watch live in your location or if you're traveling abroad, you can use a Virtual Private Network (VPN). VPNs offer a secure and private online connection, allowing you to bypass geographical restrictions to access your favorite streaming services from any device anywhere in the world.\n\nWATCH FROM

Mendez's goal-scoring excellence helped Argentina win the title in 1946 and 1947 as well.\n\nZizinho (Brazil, 17 goals)\n\nThe Brazil and Flamengo legend is the joint leader in the goal scoring list of the tournament. The striker tasted success in 1949, winning the Copa America Trophy. Scoring 5 goals, Zizinho along with legendary midfielder Jair lead the Brazilian side to their 3rd Copa America victory. Zizinho, who Pele refered to as \"the best player he had ever seen play\", still remains one of the most iconic names in Latin American football history.\n\nLolo Fernandez (Peru, 15 goals)\n\nTeodoro \"Lolo\" Fernandez scored 7 goals, leading the Peruvian side to tournament victory in 1939. The Peruvian forward also won 2 awards -- Best Player and Top Goal Scorer -- during that edition of the tournament. In his short international career of 26 games, Lolo managed to score 21 goals for Peru making him the third highest goal scorer for Peru.\n\nSeverino Varela (Uruguay, 15 goals)\n\nThe Uruguay and River Plate legend remains one of the most iconic players in Copa America history. Varela scored 5 times each in three editions(1937, 1939, 1942) of the tournament. In the 1942 edition, his goal scoring excellence helped Uruguay lift the trophy. Varela remains an iconic figure in Uruguay's rich football history for both his skill and swagger.\n\nEduardo Vargas (Chile, 14 goals)\n\nEduardo Vargas, who is the only active player in the top-five list, lead Chile to two consecutive title victories in the year 2015 and 2016. The forward played a major role in Chile's first Copa America victory in 2015, scoring 4 goals and winning the Golden Boot along with Peru's Paolo Guerrero. In the 2016 edition Vargas won the Golden Boot again, scoring 6 goals in the victorious Chilean campaign.\n\nLatest on SportstarWI vs ENG Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Salt, Buttler off to strong

Let's enjoy them now, we'll see what happens later. Messi is fine, he's happy. I'm with renewed ideas and strength. It's a nice challenge to defend the title,\" he said.\n\nScaloni said he has a full strength side to pick from for the opening game against Jesse Marsch's Canada.\n\nChelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez underwent a hernia operation in April but returned to action in the World Cup winners' recent friendlies against Ecuador and Guatemala and Scaloni said he is ready to go.\n\n\"We'll see if he plays tomorrow but he is in condition to start,\" the Argentine coach told a news conference where he appeared alongside midfielder Leandro Paredes.\n\nScaloni hinted that AS Roma midfielder Paredes is likely to start however and said that while he was keeping his starting eleven to himself, he had made his mind up.\n\n\"I have the line-up, I have no doubts. I'm going to give it to them this afternoon, they don't know yet. They're all available for tomorrow's game, the ones we think are the best will play,\" he said.\n\n\"I could be wrong, but we always think about putting out the best. With me, whoever is best always plays. Paredes had to come off in the first game of the World Cup because we thought there were other guys who were better. And there's a reason why I have him next to me now,\" said Scaloni.\n\nShould Scaloni start with Fernandez on the bench his midfield trio is likely to be made up of Rodrigo De Paul, Paredes and Alexis Mac Allister\n\nArgentina have started their CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying campaign positively with five wins out of six games but Scaloni said he was looking forward to match-ups with teams from outside of South America.\n\nThis edition of the Copa America features six teams from the CONCACAF region with Argentina facing Canada as well as Chile and Peru in Group A.\n\nWhile the USA and Mexico are traditionally the strongest teams from CONCACAF, Scaloni said he has been impressed by Canada's progress.\n\n\"They have a very good team, with important players and a new coach who has brought new ideas. In the last World Cup they played very well, but didn't get the luck they deserved,\" he said, before warning against complacency.\n\n\"They are a difficult opponent. Anyone who thinks it's all been said and done is wrong. They're the best in their country and it's extremely difficult, especially at the start of a tournament. They can put us in trouble and we have to be prepared,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Scaloni", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Scaloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1ngel_Di_Mar\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leandro_Paredes", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leandro Paredes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Fern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

Though it is usually reserved for South American CONMEBOL teams, six teams from the CONCACAF region, in which Mexico and the U.S. play, will feature.\n\nDo they stand a chance against the might of South American f\u00fatbol, or will Messi add another major trophy to his legendary career?\n\nNPR's Michel Martin talked to Jon Arnold, a soccer journalist who runs the newsletter Getting CONCACAfed, and who will be covering this year's tournament.\n\nThe Argentina and Inter Miami FC forward is nearing the twilight of his career. But Messi is not showing any signs of slowing down and his team are favorites to repeat as champions, Arnold says.\n\n\"Even though Messi is getting old in a soccer sense, he's still one of the best players in the world. He proved it in 2022 when Argentina won the World Cup. He proved it the year before that when Argentina won this tournament, the Copa Am\u00e9rica,\" Arnold said.\n\nArnold says the pressure is on primarily for Coach Gregg Berhalter, who is hoping to lead the team into the 2026 World Cup, which the U.S., Mexico and Canada will host.\n\nIf things don't go well, Arnold said, \"then there's going to be plenty of people saying that they could do a better job and asking for a different manager. So I really think that the U.S. has a big chance to prove that they're on the right track. But you could also see a team that maybe needs a different direction.\"\n\nBut does the USMNT stand a chance to win the tournament?\n\nArnold says he can't quite see the U.S. knocking out Argentina or winning the tournament, but the team has improved.\n\n\"When you look at this tournament, it's Argentina and the chasing pack. But if the U.S. is in that pack, that's progress,\" Arnold said.\n\nArnold says he's excited to see Uruguay, Argentina's neighbor.\n\n\"They're a small country, but they've really punched above their weight on the international soccer level,\" Arnold said. \"They're going to have games against the U.S. in the group stage, and then they'll likely play Brazil [or] Colombia in the next round. I think it's going to be a really fun team to watch if you want to go a little deeper than just the U.S.\"\n\nInvited teams from CONCACAF also might make for a more competitive tournament, Arnold says.\n\n\"The U.S., Mexico, even countries like Costa Rica and Panama have shown that they can compete with some of these bigger teams from South America in recent international competitions,\" Arnold said. \"So I do think it'll add an extra element of difficulty for a lot of the South American teams that want to lift their continental championship.\"\n\nThe 16-team field is split into four groups. Each team will play three games in the group stage. The top two teams from each group will move on to the knockout stage.\n\nThe final is set for July 14 at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens.\n\nMatches will be broadcast on FOX, FS1 and FS2. Spanish-language broadcasts will be available on Univision, TUDN and UniMas.\n\nMatches will also be streamed on the Fox Sports app and in Spanish on Vix+, Univision's streaming platform.", "source":

A good showing here could help cement USMNT's standing in the soccer world heading up to that extravaganza.\n\nEven if you don't think the United States can win it all, there are other fun ways to show your support and pocket some money in the process while betting on Gregg Berhalter's squad this summer.\n\nLet's jump into my four fun ways to bet on the USMNT in the tournament.\n\nUSA to win Group C (+140)\n\nUruguay is the favorite in the group, but are we sure it is ready for the prime-time spotlight?\n\nIts soccer history is incredible, and the 37-year-old Luis Suarez is an all-time great, but there are many question marks as the team transitions out of its golden era following a flop in the group stage at the 2022 World Cup.\n\nAfter October and November wins over Brazil and Argentina, Uruguay has been in shaky form. A 2-1 loss to Ivory Coast set off enough alarms that it responded with a big win over Mexico. The matchup with the USA on July 1 in Kansas City will likely determine the group outcome, and with the USA playing a \"home\" game in which the crowd should be 90 percent red, white and blue, give me the USA taking the group at plus money.\n\nThese are some fascinating odds on USA reaching the semifinals, and that's after you toss out Argentina and Brazil (-650, -500, respectively).\n\nThese numbers will dramatically shift if, say, Uruguay, Mexico or Colombia take a loss in the group stage, and shift the anticipated knockout matchup.\n\nReyna might be in the best form of any player on the U.S. heading into Copa Am\u00e9rica, and he's a fan favorite.\n\nReyna and coach Gregg Berhalter appear to have patched things up after a disastrous World Cup when the team wanted to send him home.\n\nChristian Pulisic is the obvious bet and Folarin Balogun is the guy everyone wants to see, but the smart bet is on Reyna, who will be central to the USA's attacks.\n\nPICK: Gio Reyna to be USA top goal scorer (bet $10 to win $100 total)\n\nBolivia hasn't qualified for the World Cup since 1994; it has never won a game at that stage.\n\nAt Copa Am\u00e9rica, Bolivia has one win this century. So you can pick 1-0 or 2-0, maybe a 3-0 bloodbath, but it feels like a clean sheet and an easy 2-0 win to start Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\nJason McIntyre is a FOX Sports betting analyst, and he also writes about the NFL and NBA Draft.

The likes of Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and tournament hosts United States will battle it out for the North and South American crown this summer.\n\nAfter winning the previous tournament and then the World Cup in 2022, Argentina are looking to maintain their intercontinental dominance, while the other big hitters in the competition attempt to knock Lionel Messi and Co. off of their thrown.\n\nManchester United will be represented at the tournament, which takes place across 14 cities in the USA. GOAL shows how you can follow each of the Old Trafford heroes present at the Copa America.\n\nManchester United's official hotel loyalty partner, Marriott Bonvoy, brings Reds around the world closer to their biggest passion in its latest series, United: Near & Far. If you travel to watch United players in action in the United States, Marriott Bonvoy has a hotel experience for you.\n\nAlejandro Garnacho | Argentina | Group A\n\nAt just 19 years old, Alejandro Garnacho is already a first-team regular for Manchester United. Coming off the back of a season in which he won the FA Cup and made 50 appearances in all competitions, the winger will hope coach Lionel Scaloni gives him the chance to add to the five senior caps he already has to his name.\n\nGarnacho will aim to put in a good showing if called upon when his side come up against Canada in their first game at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia on June 20.\n\nHe will also hope to have more chances to shine when they travel to the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey to meet Chile on June 25, and then four days later they have a match against Peru at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.\n\nLisandro Martinez | Argentina | Group A\n\nHaving endured a season plagued by injury, Lisandro Martinez returned to action at the end of the campaign, right on time to help guide Erik ten Hag's team to FA Cup success and book his place in Scaloni's squad.\n\nHis appearance in their pre-tournament warm-up game against Ecuador was his first Argentina outing in over a year, suggesting Scaloni is eager to put him in the starting XI during the Copa America beside Cristian Romero.\n\nShould he help Argentina through the first round as Group A winners, he and his co-stars will travel to Houston, Texas to face the runners-up of Group B, which will be either Mexico, Ecuador, Venezuela or Jamaica. If Argentina finish second in their pool, they will go to Arlington, Texas to face the winner of Group B.\n\nFacundo Pellistri | Uruguay | Group C\n\nFacundo Pellistri spent the second half of the 2023-24 season on loan at Granada, having joined the club in the January transfer window.\n\nAfter making nine Premier League appearances for Man Utd in the first half of the campaign, he immediately became a key figure for Granada and went on to score two goals and register two assists in 15 matches.\n\nThe 22-year-old did enough during 2023-24 to secure a place in Marcelo Bielsa's Uruguay squad for the competition in the United States and he will be confident of being a starter after scoring and assisting goals in their 4-0 win against Mexico.\n\nHe will hope to be given the nod when they line up against Panama at Miami Gardens, Florida on June 23 in their opening Group C clash. Four days later, they come up against Bolivia in East Rutherford, New Jersey before rounding off the group stage with a game against United States in Kansas City, Missouri on July 1.", "source":

Which legendary coach has reinvigorated Chile? And how will Argentina need to evolve to win their third international tournament in a row?\n\nThe 2024 Copa America begins on Thursday, early Friday morning UK time, as six guest nations from neighbouring federation CONCACAF (North and Central America and the Caribbean) battle it out with the 10 South American sides to try to win international football's oldest prize. Copa America was first contested in 1916, 14 years before the inaugural World Cup and 44 before the Euros began.\n\nTo help you get ready for the U.S.-hosted event, our Thom Harris will look at each team's playing style, strengths, weaknesses, key players and highlight things to keep an eye on over the next month.\n\nWe start with Group A, where we find the defending champions, one side who are Copa America debutants, and two struggling rivals with plenty in common...\n\nThe reigning Copa, and World Cup, champions will be arriving stateside to protect their continental crown. Argentina are not only overwhelming favourites to finish top of Group A, they stand a very good chance of winning the whole tournament for a record 16th time.\n\nHeading into Thursday's opening game with Canada in Atlanta, Lionel Scaloni's side have conceded just four goals in 14 matches since that World Cup final against France 18 months ago, and tasted defeat twice in 58 games going back to the semi-finals of the 2019 Copa America. What's more, with Uruguay in Group C, and Brazil and Colombia in Group D, they have not lost a competitive match to any nation on their side of the draw in this tournament since 2016.\n\nWhile their tactical shape is adaptable, Argentina's dominance hinges on possession, controlling the ball and overloading the final third to keep their opponents under pressure.\n\nIn a friendly victory over Costa Rica in March, centre-backs Cristian Romero and Nicolas Otamendi stepped forward in build-up, and the full-backs pushed high and wide. All the while, a trio of midfielders took it in turns to drop deep and search for a passage through the centre of the opposition block.\n\nBelow, it is Alexis Mac Allister who shows for the ball in frame one, with both Enzo Fernandez and Giovani Lo Celso positioned further forward, between the lines.\n\nMac Allister turns, and fires an incisive pass in to Julian Alvarez, also darting into a deeper position from his No 9 role. Dragging a defender out of position, he then flicks the ball around the oncoming challenge, allowing Lo Celso to find Angel Di Maria cutting inside onto his favoured left foot.\n\nWith such close control in tight spaces, players can continuously rotate, jumping in and out of spaces to pull the opposition around. And with the ability to pick up the pace in those tight moments, six seconds is all the time Argentina need to clock four crisp passes and a shot on goal.\n\nDepth keeps Argentina fresh, and Scaloni is spoilt for choice when it comes to well-rounded midfielders, each bringing a different skill set to the last.\n\nThe flexibility doesn't end there either, particularly with the emergence of Alejandro Garnacho as a viable option out wide. He is a dribbler, much more direct in his wide play, and offers a different proposition to other wingers in the squad.\n\nHere in their other March friendly against El Salvador, for example, we can see the familiar build-up structure, with Leandro Paredes now dropping deep. On the right, Facundo Buonanotte tucks inside, allowing his full-back to overlap, while on the left, Valentin Barco shows for the short pass and encourages Garnacho to keep the width.\n\nWith the opposition hesitant to press too high, Paredes has time to pick out the direct ball to Garnacho in behind...\n\n...which the 19-year-old takes in stride, then cuts inside and lays a pass back for Di Maria, who forces a good save from the goalkeeper.\n\nSwirling shapes and sharp passers mean Argentina can overwhelm low-block defences, and their physicality and athleticism in midfield mean that they can match most teams in an open game too.\n\nAdd a certain Lionel Messi into the equation, and they are going to be very tough to beat.\n\nThe 2-0 home defeat against Uruguay in World Cup qualifying in November showed that Argentina can be disrupted by a high-intensity press and then hit on the break. Marcelo Bielsa's visitors had seven shots -- two coming within 10 seconds of a long pass from their own half, and the other five within 10 seconds of a defensive action.\n\n\"We never felt comfortable,\" said Messi after the game. \"We were not able to have long possessions, did not create chances and played the game that they wanted, in their rhythm.\"\n\nAnd, if we're being hypercritical, Argentina don't often win games by very much. Three of their five wins in World Cup qualifying so far have been by a goal to nil, two of those secured by Otamendi from corners.\n\nHolding out defensively and trying to hit Argentina hard on the break has to be the game plan for most of their opponents.\n\nThere are plenty of candidates. Messi turns 37 next week but is still capable of winning games on his own, Di Maria has been in prolific form, while Otamendi, Romero and Emiliano Martinez are the crucial defensive pillars. But it is Argentina's strength in midfield that wins them tournaments, from the tempo-setting of Fernandez, to the natural leadership and progressive play of Rodrigo De Paul, and the all-action of Mac Allister.\n\nIn an impressive 2023-24 debut season at Liverpool, only Joao Palhinha of Fulham averaged more 'true' tackles per 1,000 opposition touches -- a metric that measures how often a player challenges for the ball with their team out of possession -- than Mac Allister in the Premier League.\n\nDespite all of Scaloni's options, Mac Allister's combination of defensive tenacity, versatility and incisive attacking play will be crucial to allow the specialists further up the pitch to thrive.\n\nTheir battle of the No 9s.\n\nBoth of Argentina's outstanding centre-forwards have surprisingly poor goalscoring records on the international stage in the past couple of years; Alvarez has not scored in 13 appearances going back to the World Cup semi-final against Croatia, while Lautaro Martinez -- despite 27 goals in all competitions for Inter Milan last season -- went 16 caps without a goal from September 2022. Though the latter has found some form with three in his last three, including two (one a penalty) at the weekend against Guatemala.\n\nGoals can come from anywhere in this team, but Scaloni has a luxurious selection headache at the sharp end of the pitch.\n\nA lot has changed since Peru were on the World Cup stage in Russia six years ago, much of it for the worse.\n\nLegendary head coach Ricardo Gareca moved on -- he returned to club management, but is now in charge of Group A rivals Chile -- while many of the players who fired his Peru team to finishing third, second and fourth at four Copas from 2015-21 are ticking into their mid-thirties and in one case, forties. Add to that a disastrous start to their 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign, along with another managerial change, and there are understandable concerns ahead of this summer.\n\nPeru have turned to experience to help stem the tide, offering 71-year-old Jorge Fossati the 24th job of a career that began in 1993. He won the Peruvian title last November with Universitario -- who provide five members of their Copa squad -- and brings a strong tactical identity with his preferred 5-3-2 shape that will look to deliver short-term solidity across the board.\n\nHis opening two games were confidence-boosting friendly wins against Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic, and he remains unbeaten after a 0-0 draw with Paraguay and a 1-0 defeat of El Salvador in this month's two warm-up games.\n\nAgainst the Dominican Republic, there were clear signs of his signature approach -- wing-backs pushing on to form a 3-5-2 in possession. Two midfield receivers sit deep to offer themselves for the pass and to guard against the counter, while creative midfielder Piero Quispe is given the freedom to roam.\n\nWithout the ball, Peru were quick to collapse back into a 5-3-2, where the ball-near central midfielder can help with particularly tricky customers on the wing.\n\nOnly Bolivia have seen less of the ball during CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying so far, so their positional discipline in their defensive shape will be tested -- particularly against Argentina in the final group match on June 29.\n\nTheir switch of system does raise some intriguing questions regarding personnel. Six of Peru's all-time 10 most-capped players were all still vying for call-ups going into those warm-up matches, though those veterans in the 26 might see their roles carefully managed during the tournament with the increased intensity at the heart of Fossati's quick-fix approach.\n\nThree-time Copa America top scorer Paulo Guerrero is now 40, and could see his starting berth challenged by the hard-working Edison Flores, while 21-year-old Joao Grimaldo will stake a claim with his adventurous wing play and channel running. Alongside Gianluca Lapadula -- himself now 34 -- Peru require energy up top, a player who can both press, but also drop deeper and link the midfield with the forward line.\n\nThe last time Peru failed to make it out of the Copa America group stage was in 1995, 10 tournaments ago -- an impressive record that may well be under threat.\n\nIn six World Cup qualifying games, Peru have mustered just seven shots on target and scored that one goal (in a 1-1 draw with Venezuela in November).\n\nLacking the technical quality to control possession, they sacrificed creativity for defensive grit in midfield under previous coach Juan Reynoso. Fossati will need his team to show more ambition on the ball to get players forward to heal an unproductive relationship between midfield and attack.\n\nHis wing-back system could help, particularly with the relentless Luis Advincula charging down their right to provide more crosses for Guerrero.\n\nHe may only have six caps to his name, but 22-year-old Quispe is Peru's next great hope.\n\nCombining aggressive ball-winning with adventurous dribbling, many see the midfielder as a natural successor to Christian Cueva, the now 32-year-old maverick in Gareca's era-defining team.\n\nQuispe's first and so far only international goal, against the Dominican Republic in March, showcased his strengths; the energy and proactivity to break out of midfield and close down a hesitant defender, positivity to drive forward and receive a one-two in the box, and composure to drop a shoulder, send a defender the wrong way and finish into the far corner.\n\nThings have not been easy for Quispe since a big move to Mexican side Pumas in January -- he has faced intense scrutiny for his stuttering output from an attacking role.\n\nPeru lack another player of his profile, however, and having shone under Fossati at club level on the left of a midfield three last season, he will continue to carry the creative burden.\n\nRetiring legends. Guerrero, Advincula, Cueva, forward Andre Carrillo and goalkeeper Pedro Gallese are all surely playing their final international tournaments.\n\nMany still have what it takes to make an impact this summer, not least Advincula, who can still thunder down the right flank with pace and power unlike pretty much anybody in South American football.\n\nGallese, long considered one of the best goalkeepers on the continent, can expect to be busy too, while Guerrero needs three goals to equal the record of 17 at Copa America tournaments.\n\nThere will be plenty of emotional goodbyes.\n\nMuch of what we've just said about Peru -- a calamitous World Cup qualifying campaign, a recent change in manager, and a rapidly aging core of key players -- can be copied and pasted here about their fierce Pacific Coast rivals.\n\nWith just five points from six games, Chile have made their worst-ever start to a World Cup qualifying campaign.\n\nStruggling head coach Eduardo Berizzo resigned after a drab goalless draw at home to Paraguay in December, clearing the way for Gareca -- who led Peru to a historic Copa America final in 2019 -- to take the reins. Keep an eye out for that contentious reunion in the Dallas Cowboys' AT&T Stadium on Friday (early Saturday in the UK).\n\nPersonal history aside, it took Gareca all of two friendly matches to leave his imprint on the team.\n\nA 3-0 win over Euro 2024 qualifiers Albania (a match played in Italy) displayed a newfound intensity in Chile's attacking play, while a 3-2 away defeat against France in their other fixture of the March international break was notable for their off-the-ball organisation against one of the world's best teams. They pasted Paraguay 3-0 last week in their only pre-Copa warm-up match, scoring all their goals by the 53rd minute.\n\nA tactical non-negotiable for Gareca is a four-man defensive structure, and that day against France in Marseille, his compact 4-4-2 block pressed high as a unit on sideways and backwards passes.\n\nBelow for example, as France move the ball out to the full-back, three Chilean players anticipate the sideways pass and jump forward; Alexis Sanchez applies pressure to the centre-back, Marcelino Nunez follows his man into midfield, while Victor Davila pushes high onto the receiver.\n\nSuch an aggressive pressing system carries inherent risk and requires buy-in from the whole team; when one player engages, those behind him must also commit in support. But just as Gareca's methods previously galvanised Peru, the early signs suggest that his more front-footed approach is helping to tap into the competitive spirit of this Chile squad.\n\nWith the ball, too, Chile have drastically picked up the pace under new management, looking to stretch the pitch and reach the final third as quickly and directly as possible.\n\nThe desire to progress the ball more efficiently was reflected in Gareca's first two squad selections, recalling neat ball-playing centre-back Igor Lichnovsky for his first international appearances since 2019, while consecutive starts for 41-year-old Real Betis goalkeeper Claudio Bravo after a year out of the national team were his only minutes at any level since November.\n\nNow up to 148 caps, former Barcelona and Manchester City keeper Bravo is assured in possession, happy to step out of his penalty area and sweep the ball from side to side. From the goal kick below, we can see that his confidence allows the centre-backs to split, and the full-backs to push high and wide.\n\nWith the opposition opting to stay compact and block out the middle, the diagonal pass opens up.\n\nWhile the ball is still in flight, Dario Osorio attacks the space in behind, and can receive the pass down the line from Isla. From two passes, Chile have four attacking players onto the last line.\n\nIt may be early, but Gareca's energetic brand of football already looks to have brought belief flooding back.\n\nChile have lots of experience at the back but their profiles are not always complimentary.\n\nOn the flanks, Isla and Suazo are dangerous going forward, but can be beaten easily in a one-v-one -- no full-back was dribbled past more often than the latter in Ligue 1 last season. Centre-backs Guillermo Maripan and Diaz lack pace and lose too many aerial duels, and although Bravo brings improved distribution, his long-range shot-stopping can sometimes let him down, as he demonstrated during his time in the Premier League.\n\nEven if the game plan is executed perfectly, individual moments of defensive weakness and lapses of concentration threaten to undermine their efforts upfield.\n\nWith Arturo Vidal omitted from the squad at age 37, Chile will be looking to Marcelino Nunez for energy and defensive spirit in midfield.\n\nThe 24-year-old came on leaps and bounds at Norwich City of the second-tier Championship last season, settling in after a difficult start to life in English football following his summer 2022 move.\n\nAn excitable attacking player, comfortable receiving on the half-turn and always looking for the defence-splitting pass, his club manager David Wagner remarked on his increasing reliability in possession as his decision-making improves. Nunez is intense without the ball too, and has already shown that he can meet Gareca's demands when it comes to following in behind the first line of pressure.\n\nWhether Chile are bunkered in or looking for attacking inspiration, Nunez will be a crucial midfield cog.\n\nAn exciting talent on the wing in 20-year-old Dario Osorio.\n\nHe scored his first senior international goal in that March friendly against France -- a thumping finish to add to his collection of spectacular strikes last season for Danish club Midtjylland -- but impressed more generally with a robust performance that demonstrated his technical ability and forward drive.\n\nMidtjylland made Osorio their most expensive signing at the start of last season, and are a club with a reputation for developing elite attacking players then selling them on. Drifting in from the right, he scored eight goals with his dangerous left foot, and looked comfortable operating in tight spaces.\n\nHe will play alongside the 35-year-old Alexis Sanchez in the summer, but there are hopes that Osorio can be his long-term successor.\n\nThis will be Canada's first appearance as a guest nation at the Copa America, and expectations ahead of their debut are... mixed.\n\nIn Alphonso Davies and Jonathan David, they possess genuine star quality; arguably the two best players in North and Central American football. Captain Stephen Eustaquio has grown into his all-action midfield role at the heart of the team, Ismael Kone has quickly become indispensable beside him, while tough-tackling full-back Alistair Johnston hit a rich vein of late-season form in Scotland with Celtic.\n\nNonetheless, since losing influential manager John Herdman to MLS club Toronto in August, their form has taken a wobble.\n\nInterim coach Mauro Biello held the fort through the Nations League campaign at the end of last year, and while the appointment of Jesse Marsch last month is undoubtedly exciting, there are concerns that he hasn't had the time to fine-tune his high-energy style of play in time for this tournament. Marsch's first two games have been testing friendlies against the Netherlands and France, and while the first ended in a breathless 4-0 defeat, their goalless draw in the other was an encouraging sign that Canada can adapt their intensity and stay compact.\n\nAs always, much of the tactical thinking will revolve around Bayern Munich's Davies.\n\nIn a dynamic, and fairly dominant opening 45 minutes against Jamaica in November -- a game they would ultimately lose 3-2 -- it looked as if Biello had found an exciting formula Marsch could take inspiration from.\n\nAs the pass network below illustrates -- outlining frequent passing combinations and average positions of players throughout the game -- both Davies (19) and Tajon Buchanan (11) were extremely advanced, while left-back Richie Laryea (22) offered plenty going forward, with overlaps to take players away from Davies and quick combinations to allow Canada to escape down the line.\n\nBelow, for example, we see Canada building up with the back four in possession, with two midfielders offering themselves for the pass. David also drops deep, he's a capable ball receiver in those pockets of space, while Davies stays high and wide.\n\nLaryea carries the ball forward in frame two, before a quick one-two with Kone allows him to foray forward with the ball at his feet. Drawing defenders in, he slips the ball through to Davies, with all of Canada's attackers converging on the penalty area.\n\nWith this squad's pace and explosive acceleration in wide areas, quick combinations and counter-attacks are often the source of their most incisive attacks down the flanks.\n\n\"I have to get to know these players more carefully before I can fully answer,\" Marsch told The Athletic, in response to the all-important question, \"but clearly, I don't want Davies to just be a defender.\n\n\"I want him to be a big part of how we attack and how we're aggressive in possession and in transition.\"\n\nFor a team with so much potential on the transition, Canada can't rely on their defensive structure to keep them in games for long enough. Of the eight goals they conceded in four games under Biello, seven could be pinned on a defensive lapse.\n\nIn that 3-2 loss to Jamaica in Toronto, both Eustaquio and Kone were dispossessed in build-up, before the former gave away the decisive penalty with a clumsy handball. Four days earlier in the first leg of that Nations League quarter-final, a 2-1 away win for Canada, they were not switched on from a quick free-kick, while a 4-1 defeat in Japan featured a miscued clearance, a calamitous own goal and another loss of possession leading directly to a dangerous attack.\n\nBiello used four different centre-backs in those matches, while legendary goalkeeper Milan Borjan - who has been left out of the Copa squad by Marsch at age 36 - has been replaced by Maxime Crepeau since that Jamaica tie.\n\nParticularly if Canada want to make the most out of wing-back roles for Davies and Buchanan, they need more security across the back line.\n\nMentioning his name eight times in this preview already might have given it away, but Davies is the undoubted difference-maker in this side. And not just for his incredible speed -- the 23-year-old popped up with a goal and an assist in that second leg against Jamaica, made seven tackles in the play-off game against Trinidad and Tobago in March that saw them qualify for the Copa America, and won a penalty in the October friendly against Japan. He offers their most direct and devastating route to the opposition penalty area, and can bring composure on the ball when he comes inside.\n\nDavid will be essential too, both from a playmaking and goalscoring perspective. As his shot map from last season suggests, he can be extremely effective at making space in the penalty box, and has scored at least 15 league goals in each of his past three seasons at Lille in France's top flight.\n\nThe 29-year-old is the record goalscorer for the Canadian men's national team and got the all-important opener against Trinidad and Tobago, but has endured a tough season in front of goal for Mallorca in Spain's La Liga.\n\nAccording to Opta data, no player in Europe's big five leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Germany's Bundesliga, Serie A in Italy and France's Ligue 1) under-performed their expected goals (xG) figure more than he did in 2023-24, scoring just three times in 35 league appearances from 69 shots.\n\nLarin was more clinical in the Copa del Rey, scoring four in seven as Mallorca got to the final, and is a towering physical presence who can operate cleanly with his back to goal, but Canada's No 9 will need to find his shooting boots sooner rather than later at this tournament.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thom_harris@nytimes.com", "name": "Thom Harris", "type": "author",

We're here to share our Copa America odds series, make a Golden Boot prediction, and pick for the Copa America.\n\nThe Copa America is in full swing, and we are here to look at some of the best potential goal scorers. There is always someone who breaks through. Recently, the defending champion was Lionel Messi, who won it in 2021. Messi will attempt to defend his crown against the likes of Vinicius Junior, Darwin Nunez, Julian Alvarez, Lautaro Martinez, and Rodrydo. Who will win? Let's look at their chances.\n\nMessi is the defending champion and the favorite to repeat as the Golden Boot winner. Ultimately, he scored 12 goals and nine assists over 12 matches for Inter Miami this season. Messi also had two goals and two assists over three matches for the CONCACAF Champions Cup. Additionally, he has scored three goals over five World Cup qualifiers.\n\nMessi also scored seven goals and three assists in seven World Cup matches in 2022 and four goals and five assists in seven matches in the 2021 Copa America. Additionally, he already has several Golden Boot awards to his collection and continues to produce at a high level. But if Messi cannot produce, there are other options who may chase him.\n\nWhy Vinicius Junior Will Win\n\nThe world is watching Vinicius Junior. Amazingly, he produced 15 goals and five assists over 26 matches for Real Madrid. Junior also delivered six goals and four assists over 10 Champions League matches. However, there have been questions about his ability to produce on the national stage.\n\nJunior has three goals over 30 games for Brazil. Somehow, he failed to score a goal in the 2021 Copa America tournament. Junior will attempt to change his reputation and take the crown for the Brazilians. Now, he will play alongside Evanilson, Endrick, and Rodrygo. The bar is high as he is talking over for Neymar, who is out with a knee injury.\n\nWhy Darwin Nunez Will Win\n\nDarwin Nunez is a curious pick and a guy who hopes to lead Uruguay to victory. Now, he has to step up and show he can score in big situations. Nunez had 11 goals and eight assists over 36 matches for Liverpool. Furthermore, he had five goals and one assist over 10 matches in the Europa League. Nunez had one goal and three assists in the EFL Cup. Also, he has generated five goals and two assists over six World Cup qualifiers.\n\nBut Nunez did not score at all in the 2022 World Cup. Currently, he is the main man in Uruguay now that Luis Suarez is on the wrong side of 30. Nunez is looking forward to making his mark on the international stage.\n\nWhy Julian Alvarez Will Win\n\nIf Messi does not power Argentina to victory, Julian Alvarez might be an option. Alvarez scored 11 goals and nine assists in 36 matches for Manchester City and five goals and two assists in seven matches in the Champions League.\n\nBut he did not score in the World Cup qualifiers. Ultimately, that is different from the 2022 World Cup, when he generated four goals. Alvarez is 24 years old and is capable of winning over the hearts of Argentinians everywhere. Can he take the throne from Messi and win the Golden Boot?\n\nWhy Lautaro Martinez Will Win\n\nLautaro Martinez is another player who dominates on a local level and struggles at the national level. Amazingly, he scored 24 goals and three assists over 33 matches for Inter Milan. But he did not score once for Argentina in the World Cup. But he has not always struggled on the national stage.\n\nMartinez had three goals over six matches in the 2021 Copa America and two in four matches in the 2019 Copa America tournaments. Thus, he has shown he can score on the world stage. But he will also be competing with Alvarez for a starting role and might not be able to consistently get chances. Yet, he has a lot of size for someone who plays 90 minutes and will be a threat for the Golden Boot.\n\nWhy Rodrygo Will Win\n\nRodrygo is the wildcard pick you will see here. Regardless, he is one of the most talented players you will see in this tournament. Rodrygo had five goals and two assists over 13 matches in the Champions League. Additionally, he had 10 goals and five assists over 34 matches for Real Madrid.\n\nRodrygo tallied two goals over six matches in the current World Cup qualifiers. However, he did not score a goal and only generated an assist in the last World Cup. He will also be playing out of position.\n\nFinal Golden Cup Prediction & Pick\n\nMessi is still exceptional, even at his age. Then, there are Junior, Nunez, and Alvarez. All four of these players can produce big results for their countries. Consequently, the Golden Boot winner is usually the guy who plays the best for his team and helps them win the tournament. If Argentina is to win the Copa America again, it won't be Messi who does it. Instead, Alvarez will take that next step and take the throne.\n\nClick here for more betting news & predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rb_hayek@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Rb Hayek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrygo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rodrygo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CONCACAF Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EFL Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neymar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neymar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inter Milan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Copa-America-Golden-Boot-Prediction.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658543", "eventUri": "eng-9658543", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

They have important players and a new coach who has brought in new ideas,\" Scaloni said at a press conference earlier this week. \"They are a complicated opponent, but we are prepared to play our game.\"\n\nMeanwhile, newly appointed Canadian coach Jesse Marsch is well aware of the challenge he and his players are up against.\n\n\"We obviously know the quality of their players. We've done a lot of preparation individually... We know we're in for a really tough match, but we're really excited for the challenge.\"\n\nAmong the 16 nations in this year's draw, Canada, which sits 48th on FIFA's world ranking, has the 12th-best odds of winning the event with a 1.1% chance (as per Forbes Betting).\n\nArgentina has the best odds (36.3%) of repeating their 2021 result.\n\nKickoff at Mercedes-Benz Stadium is set for 8 pm ET/5 pm PT.

On Tuesday night, they stayed up to watch Cristiano Ronaldo engage in his last dance as Portugal rallied to put it past the Czech Republic 2-1 in Euro 2024, while his biggest rival Lionel Messi will lead Argentina's title defence in Copa America against Canada in the wee hours of Friday, 20 June.\n\nNo doubt, it doesn't get any bigger than this since the Euro and the Copa started coinciding ever since the pandemic pushed both the marquee events to be held in 2021 and then again this year after a three-year cycle. It's too much on the plate for a football fan alright, not to speak of the potential commercial opportunities missed if they had been held in alternate years like in the past - but no one is complaining.\n\nThe problem, however, lies elsewhere. The simultaneous staging of the two continental showpieces have - truth be told - devalued the Copa to a great deal in the eyes of the neutral fan for a number of reasons. While Euro, where the field has been increased to 24 teams from 16 since 2016, has virtually become a brand which resembles the World Cup without Argentina and Brazil - Copa has become a two-horse race and are left to fight it's own battle despite a history of over 100 years.\n\nWhat is it that makes the Euros stand head and shoulders above the Copa in the context of recent times? Before moving to the economics of the sport which is now so Europe-centric, one must doff a hat to the level playing field that Euro is where there are virtually no easy games. A few examples of the ongoing competition in Germany will illustrate the point - Slovakia, ranked 48th in the world, stunned third ranked Belgium 1-0 the other day while Georgia, playing in their first major tournament, looked much more impressive than the scoreline of their 3-1 defeat to Turkey suggests.", "source": {"uri": "nationalheraldindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gautam_bhattacharyya@nationalheraldindia.com", "name": "Gautam Bhattacharyya", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/nationalherald%2F2024-06%2F443104d0-b26b-49d3-b318-5bc56d86cc55%2FF7WeBkzX0AAaWre.jpeg?rect=0%2C0%2C1920%2C1008&w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658543", "eventUri": "eng-9658543", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-21", "textStart": 101, "textEnd": 108}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 512, "textEnd": 519}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

Image: Getty Images/AFP\n\nArgentina manager Lionel Scaloni has suggested that his compatriots not worry about when Lionel Messi and Angel Di Maria will retire and to instead enjoy watching them in the Copa America.\n\nWorld champions and defending Copa America title holders Argentina begin the 16-team tournament against Canada at the Mercedes Benz Stadium on Thursday.\n\nMessi, the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner who turns 37 next week, will captain Argentina in what is surely his final edition of the continental championship.\n\nAnd with Angel Di Maria, 36, also reaching the final stages of his career, the end of an era is on the horizon.\n\nBut Scaloni said that shouldn't be the focus around the team in the coming tournament.\n\n\"It doesn't make much sense to think about when they're gone. Let's enjoy them now, we'll see what happens later. Messi is fine, he's happy. I'm with renewed ideas and strength. It's a nice challenge to defend the title,\" he said.\n\nScaloni said he has a full strength squad to pick from for the opener against Jesse Marsch's Canada.\n\nEnzo Fernandez underwent a hernia operation in April but returned to action in the friendlies against Ecuador and Guatemala and Scaloni said he is ready to go.\n\n\"We'll see if he plays tomorrow but he is in condition to start,\" the Argentine coach told a news conference where he appeared alongside midfielder Leandro Paredes.\n\nScaloni hinted that Paredes is likely to start however and said that while he was keeping his starting eleven to himself, he had made his mind up.\n\n\"I have the line-up, I have no doubts. I'm going to give it to them this afternoon, they don't know yet. They're all available for tomorrow's game, the ones we think are the best will play,\" he said.\n\n\"I could be wrong, but we always think about putting out the best. With me, whoever is best always plays. Paredes had to come off in the first game of the World Cup because we thought there were other guys who were better. And there's a reason why I have him next to me now,\" said Scaloni.\n\nShould Scaloni start with Fernandez on the bench his midfield trio is likely to be made up of Rodrigo De Paul, Paredes and Alexis Mac Allister.\n\nArgentina have started their South American World Cup qualifying campaign with five wins out of six games but Scaloni said he was looking forward to match-ups with teams from outside of South America.\n\nThis edition of the Copa America features six teams from the CONCACAF region with Argentina facing Canada as well as Chile and Peru in Group A.\n\nWhile the USA and Mexico are traditionally the strongest teams from CONCACAF, Scaloni said he has been impressed by Canada's progress.\n\n\"They have a very good team, with important players and a new coach who has brought new ideas. In the last World Cup they played very well, but didn't get the luck they deserved,\" he said, before warning against complacency.\n\n\"They are a difficult opponent.

Peru has also taken a step back since qualifying for the 2018 World Cup, its first trip to soccer's showpiece event in 26 years.\n\nThen there's Canada, which snapped its own World Cup appearance drought two years ago by topping the Concacaf region and is now led by American manager Jesse Marsch.\n\nCoach: Lionel Scaloni\n\nHighest finish: 29-time winner (1921, 1925, 1927, 1929, 1937, 1941, 1945, 1946, 1947, 1955, 1957, 1959, 1991, 1993, 2021)\n\n2021 finish: Winner\n\nKey players: Lionel Messi, Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, Emiliano Mart\u00ednez\n\nWhat we're excited to watch: Although he'll turn 37 four days after the Albiceleste kicks off the tournament against the Canadians on June 20, all eyes are on Messi once again. Will the GOAT add to his recent haul of silverware this summer? And can he be the dominant force he was when he finished second in scoring at the 2022 World Cup despite coming off a nagging leg injury that has limited him this season for MLS team Inter Miami?\n\nWhat success looks like: Argentina expects to win every competition it enters. That is especially true now following their unforgettable Copa and World Cup triumphs in 2021 and 2022. With Messi's international future in doubt after this summer, can they potentially send the living legend off with another trophy?\n\nAchilles' heel: Complacency. After reaching such dizzying heights in their last two major tournament appearances, will the motivation be the same for Scaroni's men?\n\nX-Factor: Lauturo Martinez. Benched in favor of Julian Alvarez for most of the successful 2022 World Cup run, Inter Milan's captain enters the Copa Am\u00e9rica in red-hot form and as Scaloni's top striker: the 26-year-old led Italy's Serie A in scoring this season, and he has three goals in four international games in 2024 -- including two in Argentina's final Copa tuneup, a 4-1 win over Guatemala on June 14.\n\nCoach: Jesse Marsch\n\nHighest finish: First appearance\n\n2021 finish: N/A\n\nKey players: Alphonso Davies, Jonathan David, Cyle Larin\n\nWhat we're excited to watch: Can Marsch restore Les Rouges' magic? Canada has fallen back to earth in the two years since emerging as one of the darlings of 2022 World Cup qualifying by reaching the main event for the first time since 1986. They played well in Qatar despite losing all three games in a group that contained Belgium and eventual semifinalists Croatia and Morocco. But then coach John Hermann left for Toronto FC, and Canada needed a playoff win over Trinidad and Tobago just to make the Copa cut following a home loss to Jamaica.\n\nWhat success looks like: Surviving group play is the ultimate goal, and it's not impossible. But let's start with simply winning a major tournament game, something the Canadians have never done in nine matches over two World Cups and one Confederations Cup.\n\nAchilles' heel: Depth. Much of Canada's starting lineup has been in place for years, a familiarity that has helped the northerners punch above their weight. But injuries and suspensions happen in tournament play as the games come thick and fast, and Marsch doesn't have many difference-makers on his bench.\n\nX-Factor: Davies. The Bayern Munich star is Canada's one truly all-planet player, and he's taken on more of a leadership role under Marsch. Can he lead his country on a deep run this summer?\n\nCoach: Ricardo Gareca\n\nHighest finish: Champions (2015, 2016)\n\n2021 finish: Quarterfinals\n\nKey players: Claudio Bravo, Alexis Sanchez, Erick Pulgar\n\nWhat we're excited to watch: While Chile didn't qualify for either of the last two World Cups, they've been superb at the Copa Am\u00e9rica for the better part of two decades, advancing from group play at each of the last six editions and reaching at least the semifinals in three of the last four.\n\nWhat success looks like: In a tricky group that contains the defending champ, keeping that streak of reaching the knockout stage alive would be acceptable. Anything beyond that is gravy.\n\nAchilles' heel: What's left of Chile's Golden Generation is now borderline geriatric: Bravo is 41, Sanchez is 35 and a number of other regulars (Mauricio Isla, Esteban Pavez, Diego Vald\u00e9s, Eduardo Vargas) are also now in their mid-30s.\n\nX-Factor: English-born forward Ben Brereton D\u00edaz. The 25-year-old scored six goals in just 14 Premier League appearances for hapless Sheffield United last season.\n\nCoach: Jorge Fossati\n\nHighest finish: Champions (1939, 1975)\n\n2021 finish: Fourth\n\nKey players: Pedro Gallese, Gianluca Lapadula, Edison Flores\n\nWhat we're excited to watch: Despite its long absence at the World Cup, Peru has been a model of consistency at the Copa America. La Bicolor is aiming for an 11th consecutive knockout stage appearance this summer and finished runner-up to host Brazil in 2019.\n\nWhat success looks like: It starts with surviving what many observers are calling this Copa's Group of Death. If Peru can do it, a beatable opponent from Group B awaits in the quarterfinals.\n\nAchilles' heel: Similar to the Chileans, the core of Peru's squad has become a little long in the tooth. Captain at all-time top scorer Paolo Guerrero -- a three-time Copa America Golden Boot-winner -- is now 40, while staring defenders Lapadula and Luis Adv\u00edncula and Carlos Zambrano are both 34.\n\nX-Factor: Fossati. Hired in December following a 0W-4L-2T start in South America's qualifying tournament for the 2026 World Cup, Peru has gone unbeaten since, with three wins and a tie in four games.", "source": {"uri":

Let's enjoy them now, we'll see what happens later. Messi is fine, he's happy. I'm with renewed ideas and strength. It's a nice challenge to defend the title,\" he said.\n\nScaloni said he has a full strength side to pick from for the opening game against Jesse Marsch's Canada.\n\nChelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez underwent a hernia operation in April but returned to action in the World Cup winners' recent friendlies against Ecuador and Guatemala and Scaloni said he is ready to go.\n\n\"We'll see if he plays tomorrow but he is in condition to start,\" the Argentine coach told a news conference where he appeared alongside midfielder Leandro Paredes.\n\nScaloni hinted that AS Roma midfielder Paredes is likely to start however and said that while he was keeping his starting eleven to himself, he had made his mind up.\n\nMore from this section Central China farmers face crop failures in 'withering' drought New mystery monolith appears in Nevada desert Two brand-new pools unveiled at Harry S. Truman High School\n\n\"I have the line-up, I have no doubts. I'm going to give it to them this afternoon, they don't know yet. They're all available for tomorrow's game, the ones we think are the best will play,\" he said.\n\n\"I could be wrong, but we always think about putting out the best. With me, whoever is best always plays. Paredes had to come off in the first game of the World Cup because we thought there were other guys who were better. And there's a reason why I have him next to me now,\" said Scaloni.\n\nShould Scaloni start with Fernandez on the bench his midfield trio is likely to be made up of Rodrigo De Paul, Paredes and Alexis Mac Allister\n\nArgentina have started their CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying campaign positively with five wins out of six games but Scaloni said he was looking forward to match-ups with teams from outside of South America.\n\nThis edition of the Copa America features six teams from the CONCACAF region with Argentina facing Canada as well as Chile and Peru in Group A.\n\nWhile the USA and Mexico are traditionally the strongest teams from CONCACAF, Scaloni said he has been impressed by Canada's progress.\n\n\"They have a very good team, with important players and a new coach who has brought new ideas. In the last World Cup they played very well, but didn't get the luck they deserved,\" he said, before warning against complacency.\n\n\"They are a difficult opponent. Anyone who thinks it's all been said and done is wrong. They're the best in their country and it's extremely difficult, especially at the start of a tournament. They can put us in trouble and we have to be prepared,\" he said.\n\nsev/rcw", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_evans@reformer.com", "name": "Simon Evans", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Scaloni", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Scaloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1ngel_Di_Mar\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leandro_Paredes", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leandro Paredes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Fern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Marsch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Marsch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry S.

Over the years, the Copa America has seen some heavily one-sided matches, where the opposition was completely blown away.\n\nSportstar looks at the three highest margin of victories in the history of the Copa America.\n\nArgentina 12-0 Ecuador\n\nJoint-record-time Copa America champion Argentina (15 titles) has the enviable record of securing the highest margin of victory in the competition's history.\n\nArgentina beat Ecuador 12-0 at the Estadio Centenario, Montevideo, Uruguay, on 22 January 1942. Ecuador lost all of its games that year and was already beaten 7-0 by Uruguay in its opening match.\n\nEcuador was already 6-0 down by half-time. Argentina's Manuel Moreno netted five goals in total, with Enrique Garcia, Adolfo Pedernera, Angel Perruca and Herminio Masantonio scoring four each.\n\nArgentina, however, did not win that edition, with Uruguay grabbing the title after finishing top with 12 points (In the earlier format, each team played against each of the other teams. Two points were awarded for a win, one point for a draw and no points for a defeat). Argentina finished runner-up with 10 points.\n\nArgentina 11-0 Venezuela\n\nArgentina also holds the record of having the second-highest margin of victories in the Copa America, where the Albiceleste beat Venezuela 11-0 in the 1975 edition.\n\nMario Killer, Mario Kempes and Mario Zanabria scored a brace each, with the other goals coming from Americo Gallego, Osvaldo Ardiles, Daniel Killer, Ramon Boveda and Leopoldo Luque.\n\nHowever, Argentina did not win that year too, with Peru grabbing the title.\n\nBrazil 10-0 Bolivia\n\nBrazil has the third-highest margin of victory in Copa America history with a 10-0 win against Bolivia in the 1949 edition.\n\nNininho scored a hat-trick in the match, while Zizinho, Simao and Claudio C Pinto scored a brace each. Jair scored the other goal of the match.\n\nBrazil followed up on this dominating win by going on to win that year.\n\nThey were 6-0 down by half-time against Argentina, with Manuel Moreno netting four goals (he would score five in total), Enrique Garcia, Adolfo Pedernera, Angel Perruca and Herminio Masantonio (4) would contribute the other goals. Argentina managed an 11-0 win against Venezuela in 1975 while Brazil are the only other side to reach double figures beating Bolivia 10-1 in 1949.\n\nLatest on SportstarIndia vs Afghanistan Live

Messi has finally made his mark for the national team, securing a Copa Am\u00e9rica and World Cup title in the last three years.\n\nMessi is still showing his special talents at the age of 36 now as an Inter Miami player, and he will make everything tick for Argentina at this tournament once again.\n\nFlores is perhaps one of the lesser-known players on our list, but the 30-year-old has shown flashes of brilliance throughout his injury-riddled career.\n\nDespite never truly breaking out of the Americas, Flores has scored 16 goals in 73 appearances for his nation and will be called upon to provide a spark up top for La Bicolor in a tough Group A.\n\nYes, it is 2024 and we're still highlighting Alexis S\u00e1nchez as Chile's player to watch heading into a summer tournament.\n\nThe Chilean legend is still starting in every big game for his nation and will continue to do so in the United States during Copa Am\u00e9rica this summer.\n\n51 goals for your nation is already enough for legend-status, but S\u00e1nchez is not done yet.\n\nWhile it may have been easy to choose the likes of Alphonso Davies or Jonathan David for Canada's player to watch, Tajon Buchanan is truly starting to make a name for himself on the wing.\n\nThe Inter Milan man could become a key cog in the new Jesse Marsch machine out on the flank, with bags of pace and composure in the final-third.\n\nThe Feyenoord man has struggled when on the pitch for El Tri, but surely his superb club form will translate to international duties at some point.\n\nGim\u00e9nez is certainly the present and future of Mexico's attack, with 29 goal contributions in 30 Eredivisie games last season, but he will have to find that same form this summer if his nation are to get anything out of the tournament.\n\nMost football fans will know the name Mois\u00e9s Caicedo after the midfielder made a big-money move to Premier League giants Chelsea.\n\nWhile his form at Stamford Bridge has not been nearly as mercurial as when he was Brighton's midfield stalwart, Caicedo has the ability to control a game all on his own, and his passing range is wide enough to open up the defence of any of Ecuador's Group B rivals.\n\nGone are the days of Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n strutting his stuff for West Brom, but that doesn't mean the 34-year-old is out of commission.\n\nThe Venezuelan just recently led Mexican side Pachuca to a CONCACAF Champions Cup title and will lead the line for La Vinotinto once again this summer.\n\nJamaica's new generation of players has yet to truly prove itself, but a player like Michail Antonio is just the level needed to make a splash in a tournament like Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\nThere was plenty of off-field turmoil between the Reggae Boyz and the federation, but with that seemingly in the rearview mirror, Antonio and his mates can focus on the task at hand.\n\nWest Ham's record Premier League goalscorer has bagged just under 70 league goals with the Hammers, but now is the time to show his stuff for Jamaica.\n\nLike a few of our other players on this list, Reyna may not be the first name that jumps off a United States team sheet comprised of Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Folarin Balugon and others, but the midfielder saves his best work for the Stars and Stripes.\n\nReyna is the creative flare in a usually industrious midfield for the United States, and will be the link between attack and defence as Gregg Berhalter's side play out of the back.\n\nN\u00fa\u00f1ez seemingly became the butt of a running joke last season at Liverpool, garnering a reputation for missing big chances, but like Gio Reyna before him, N\u00fa\u00f1ez has turned it on for his nation as of late.\n\nThe striker bagged a hat-trick against fellow participants Mexico in a 4-0 rout just last week, and he'll head into the tournament in superb form for Uruguay as a result.\n\nCarrasquilla has made a name for himself in North America as one of the top midfielders in Major League Soccer, leading Houston to a U.S. Open Cup triumph over Lionel Messi and Inter Miami.\n\nThe 25-year-old has already earned over 50 caps for Panama and will be the key man in midfield if his nation are to stun the world and finish in the top-two of Group C.\n\nMiguel Terceros is likely a name that few people have heard heading into the tournament, but the Bolivian youngster could be poised for breakout summer in a side with relatively low expectations.\n\nThe 20-year-old Santos man can dribble with the best of them and could be the creative spark La Verde need as strong underdogs in Group C.\n\nLike their rivals Argentina, Brazil's player to watch was an easy choice -- Real Madrid star Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior.\n\nBrazil's form heading into the tournament leaves plenty to be desired, but with stars like Vini and his supporting cast, they should be able to turn it on at any time.\n\nNo matter how poor the mood in the camp is, Vini can be the most electric player in Copa Am\u00e9rica if he feels like it.\n\nLuis D\u00edaz may not be the most prolific in front of goal, but as far as crafty South American wingers go, the Liverpool man is up there with the best.\n\nAfter a Premier League season in which he amassed 13 goal contributions, D\u00edaz is the face of a team that still boasts one-time Colombian saviour James Rodriguez, and it's his attacking flare that Los Cafeteros could rely on if they are to play a major role at the Copa this year.\n\nThe Brighton and Hove Albion youngster is another name on the list of burgeoning stars who could get their name in lights with a good showing in Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\nBefore his move to the Premier League, Enciso became a household name in South America after becoming one of the youngest players to score in the Copa Libertadores. But can he now make a similar impact for his nation in a star-studded Group D?\n\nDespite not participating in the last World Cup cycle due to off-field differences with manager former Luis Fernando Suarez, Ugalde comes into the tournament as one of the brightest young talents in the Americas.\n\nThe 22-year-old's most prolific spell as a striker came for Dutch side FC Twente when he bagged 22 goals in 84 games before making the move to Spartak Moscow.\n\nUgalde found the back of the net against World Champions Argentina back in March, and Costa Rica will need something similar if they are going to pull off a shock.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edison_Flores", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edison Flores"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_S\u00e1nchez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexis S\u00e1nchez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Reyna", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Giovanni Reyna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajon_Buchanan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tajon Buchanan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonso_Davies", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphonso Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Marsch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Marsch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michail_Antonio", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michail Antonio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter Milan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mois\u00e9s_Caicedo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mois\u00e9s Caicedo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_N\u00fa\u00f1ez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weston_McKennie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weston McKennie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Pulisic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian Pulisic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salom\u00f3n_Rond\u00f3n", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Berhalter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gregg Berhalter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felipe_Caicedo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felipe Caicedo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.F._Pachuca", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "C.F.

Lionel Messi-starred Argentina will target the record 16th title while Canada are making their debut in one of the oldest and biggest international tournaments in the world.\n\nThe USA are hosting the tournament for the second time in history and fans will witness six new teams from North America participating in the 48th edition of the tournament. Brazil, the nine-time winners, will be without their captain Neymar due to an injury but are tipped to mount a title challenge once again with the likes of Vinicius Jr and Alisson Becker leading the start-studded side.\n\nArgentina famously equalled Uruguay's record for most titles after beating Brazil in the previous edition of the tournament in 2021. The Argentine captain Lionel Messi needs only five goals to surpass legendary Norberto M\u00e9ndez and Zizinho's record for most goals in the tournament.\n\nThe organisers changed the format of the tournament with six teams from the North American continent joining ten teams from South America. 16 teams are equally divided into groups of four with the defending champions Argentia getting comparatively easy opponents in Group A.\n\nAll teams will play once against other teams in their respective groups. The top two teams from each group will progress to the knockout stages - quarterfinals, semifinals and final.\n\nThe organisers are yet to announce official broadcasters for the Indian viewers. Sony Sports Network and FanCode are expected to be named TV broadcast and online streaming partners a day before the tournament begins on June 20.\n\n14 venues across the United States of America will host a total of 32 matches.

Canada and Peru will face off on June 25 at Children's Mercy Park for their second match in Group A. Then, the United States Men's National Team will host Uruguay at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium on July 1 for the final group play match in Group C.\n\nThe Copa America has been held regularly since 1916. This edition is the second time the tournament has been held in the United States, following the 2016 Copa America Centenario. This edition of the tournament brings together the 16 best national soccer teams in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nHere's a preview of each of the teams coming to Kansas City this summer:\n\nExpectations: Canada will make its first Copa America appearance in this tournament and is also coming off its second World Cup appearance in 2022. Getting out of the group stage would be a momentous step forward as the northern nation prepares to host its part of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThree key players: Alphonso Davies is a global superstar playing at Bayern Munich in Germany, with rumors he's headed to Real Madrid, soccer's equivalent to the New York Yankees. You can't take your eyes off him when he's on the field. Jonathan David is a do-it-all type of striker with the speed to burn defenses. Canada's prospects of getting out of the group increase heavily if he's in form. Isma\u00ebl Kon\u00e9 is another talented midfielder who has enjoyed a quick rise. He's fast, skilled and can put out fires all over the midfield with his workmanlike ability.\n\nExpectations: Peru is nearing a generational turnover, as a significant portion of its international roster is filled with players in their mid-30s. After making the World Cup in 2018 and narrowly missing out on qualification for 2022, this might be the last swan song for Peru's most recent golden generation.\n\nThree key players: Goalkeeper Pedro Gallese, nicknamed \"El Pulpo\" or the octopus, is arguably Peru's best defensive player. Gallese spent the last few years playing in MLS with Orlando City and was one of the league's best shot-stoppers annually. He's somewhat eccentric and has a flair for the dramatic. Christian Cueva is a bit of a club journeyman but has been routinely important to Peru's hopes. He holds the No. 10 jersey for this tournament. Paolo Guerrero is a South American legend. He's the active leading goalscorer at the Copa America and has still found the back of the net for club and country even as he turned 40 this January.\n\nExpectations: Getting out of the group is a bare minimum. For the first time ever, the United States Men's National Team (USMNT) fileds a team comprised entirely of players who play their club trade in the top five European leagues. The USMNT talent is starting to come into its collective prime, which means expectations are raised. The bar for success has surpassed just getting out of the group.\n\nKey Players: Christian Pulisic scored 15 goals and provided eight assists in his first season with AC Milan, and had the best season of any American attacker. If Pulisic isn't at his best, the USMNT will struggle in the attack. Tyler Adams brings intensity and bite into the midfield when he's there, and the USMNT looks better for it. Adams is still returning from injury, so the more he can play for the USMNT, the better. Timothy Weah plays a more attacking role with the USMNT than he does with Juventus. The USMNT needs a secondary option for the attack to flow through, and Weah has the game-changing speed to bring it.\n\nExpectations: Uruguay has been phenomenal in World Cup Qualifying, defeating Argentina and Brazil in the last calendar year. With its pedigree in this tournament, getting out of the group is also a bare minimum. Uruguay is tied with Argentina for the most Copa America championships ever.\n\nKey Players: While Darwin Nu\u00f1ez doesn't finish with consistency at Liverpool, he has done so recently for his country. The minutes load over the days will limit Luis Suarez to super-sub minutes, so Nu\u00f1ez will be the guy for Uruguay up top. Federico Valverde is arguably the best box-to-box midfielder in the world right now. He's a workhorse with pace, power and a nose for the spectacular strike from distance. Ronald Araujo has been one of the best center backs in the world with Barcelona and is just as good as the right back for Uruguay. He's a stabilizing presence defensively and on set pieces.", "source": {"uri": "kansascity.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kansas City Star"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Fans around the world, but especially in Argentina, have been eagerly awaiting this day ever since their beloved squad, led by perhaps the greatest soccer player of all time, won the 2022 World Cup.\n\nBut when Lionel Messi, the Argentine captain and superstar, takes the field at Mercedes-Benz Stadium with his teammates as the favorites to defend their 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica title, a simmering sadness will follow him.\n\nWill this be the last time Mr. Messi, who turns 37 next week and said two years ago that it was his final World Cup, wears the blue and white Argentine uniform in a major tournament?

Let's enjoy them now, we'll see what happens later. Messi is fine, he's happy. I'm with renewed ideas and strength. It's a nice challenge to defend the title,\" he said.\n\nScaloni said he has a full strength side to pick from for the opening game against Jesse Marsch's Canada.\n\nChelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez underwent a hernia operation in April but returned to action in the World Cup winners' recent friendlies against Ecuador and Guatemala and Scaloni said he is ready to go.\n\n\"We'll see if he plays tomorrow but he is in condition to start,\" the Argentine coach told a news conference where he appeared alongside midfielder Leandro Paredes.\n\nScaloni hinted that AS Roma midfielder Paredes is likely to start however and said that while he was keeping his starting eleven to himself, he had made his mind up.\n\n\"I have the line-up, I have no doubts. I'm going to give it to them this afternoon, they don't know yet. They're all available for tomorrow's game, the ones we think are the best will play,\" he said.\n\n\"I could be wrong, but we always think about putting out the best. With me, whoever is best always plays. Paredes had to come off in the first game of the World Cup because we thought there were other guys who were better. And there's a reason why I have him next to me now,\" said Scaloni.\n\nShould Scaloni start with Fernandez on the bench his midfield trio is likely to be made up of Rodrigo De Paul, Paredes and Alexis Mac Allister\n\nArgentina have started their CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying campaign positively with five wins out of six games but Scaloni said he was looking forward to match-ups with teams from outside of South America.\n\nThis edition of the Copa America features six teams from the CONCACAF region with Argentina facing Canada as well as Chile and Peru in Group A.\n\nWhile the USA and Mexico are traditionally the strongest teams from CONCACAF, Scaloni said he has been impressed by Canada's progress.\n\n\"They have a very good team, with important players and a new coach who has brought new ideas.

Let's enjoy them now, we'll see what happens later. Messi is fine, he's happy. I'm with renewed ideas and strength.

I'm going to give it to them this afternoon, they don't know yet. They're all available for tomorrow's game, the ones we think are the best will play,\" he said.\n\n\"I could be wrong, but we always think about putting out the best.

In the last World Cup they played very well, but didn't get the luck they deserved,\" he said, before warning against complacency.\n\n\"They are a difficult opponent.

Strong performances at the 2022 World Cup add weight to the argument that the 25-year-old fully deserves to be a first-choice starter.\n\nDouglas Luiz, Brazil\n\nThe 26-year-old scored nine goals and claimed five assists to help Aston Villa secure Champions League football next season - and catch the eye of other clubs. However, before club football resumes the midfielder will be bidding to play an important role in Brazil's bid to regain their Copa America title.\n\nDarwin Nunez, Uruguay\n\nLiverpool's Nunez should go into the tournament full of confidence, following a hat-trick in the friendly win against Mexico. The 24-year-old forward is a handful and can help his country push for a 16th Copa America title - and first for 13 years.\n\nJulian Alvarez, Argentina\n\nLike Mac Allister, Alvarez will be keen to replicate his fine form at the 2022 World Cup. The 24-year-old Manchester City forward can be key in the world champions' quest for more silverware, having scored 11 goals and registered nine assists in the Premier League in 2023-24.\n\nMoises Caicedo, Ecuador\n\nThe 22-year-old can take control of the Ecuador midfield and be an important player for his country. Chelsea's big-money signing from Brighton prospered towards the end of the Premier League season and finished with a flourish, scoring from the halfway line in the final match against Bournemouth.\n\nLuis Diaz, Colombia\n\nDiaz, 27, proved he has the pedigree for this tournament in 2021, scoring four goals in five games. The winger's creativity for Liverpool brought eight goals and five assists last season and he can again be a strong influence for Colombia this summer.\n\nCristian Romero, Argentina\n\nRomero played a vital role in Argentina's World Cup win two years ago, starting six of their seven matches. Tottenham's 26-year-old centre-back, who also carries a threat in the opposition penalty area, will hope it is the same story in the Copa America.\n\nAntonee Robinson, United States\n\nMilton Keynes-born Robinson was one of the standout left-backs in the Premier League last season. If the 26-year-old can maintain his form - and his team-mates collectively excel - the United States could make the most of their host nation status and enjoy a fruitful tournament.\n\nEdson Alvarez, Mexico\n\nWith a solid first season in the top flight behind him following his move from Ajax, Alvarez should be full of confidence heading into the Copa America. Mexico have never won the tournament and will likely need the 26-year-old West Ham midfielder to be at his best if they are to break their duck.\n\nBruno Guimaraes, Brazil\n\nThe 26-year-old midfielder goes into the tournament on the back of two consistent seasons with Newcastle, helping him become a favourite with the fans. If he can help Dorival Junior's team land the Copa America for a 10th time, he could achieve similar cult status in his home nation.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news",

On June 17, the biggest intercontinental f\u00fatbol tournament in Latin America's official social media channels uploaded a teaser revealing the Colombian superstar's iconic white-rimmed sunglasses. Fans are now speculating that he's part of the upcoming soccer festivities.\n\nBased on this teaser, it looks like Feid will be a part of Copa Am\u00e9rica 2024 - however, it's unclear how. The tournament officially starts on June 20, when Argentina (the defending Copa Am\u00e9rica and World Cup champions) goes against Canada. The inaugural game will be played at 8 p.m. ET at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, GA. On that same day, the \"LUNA\" singer is scheduled to perform at the Capital One Arena in Washington, DC. Could it be that he will open the soccer match and then hop on an almost two-hour flight to continue his Ferxxocalipsis Tour 2024 show?\n\nRegardless of what Feid has in store for his fans, social media users are already thrilled about the thought of him opening the oldest continental f\u00fatbol championship in the world. An X user commented: \"feid opening for copa America is top tier and I just wanna go see him live so bad.\"\n\nOther social media users are questioning if he's opening the game or if he's part of the tournament's official song. An Instagram user, germanandre1996, wrote in Spanish: \"ferxxo at the opening? or is there an official song?\" It's worth noting that Shakira's \"Punter\u00eda\" featuring Cardi B is the tournament's official anthem for TelevisaUnivision.\n\nThe Copa Am\u00e9rica 2024 will be played from June 20 to July 14. Ten CONMEBOL teams will go against 6 CONCACAF teams. Group A includes Argentina, Peru, Chile, and Canada. Group B includes Mexico, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Jamaica.

They then followed that up with their memorable World Cup triumph in Qatar in 2022.\n\nSuperstar Lionel Messi remains part of the set-up and the 36-year-old will feel at home as the tournament is being staged in the United States -- where he currently plays his club football for Inter Miami.\n\nThis is expected to go the way of the defending champions, as Argentina aim to put on a statement performance in the tournament-opener.\n\nThe South American giants possess one of the strongest squads in the competition, which includes household names like Messi, Tottenham defender Cristian Romero, Chelsea star Enzo Fernandez and Liverpool playmaker Alexis Mac Allister.\n\nCanada have some well-known players, too, with the likes of Bayern Munich defender Alphonso Davies, Watford midfielder Ismael Kone and Lille frontman Jonathan David forming part of their line-up.\n\nHowever, it would be a big surprise if Argentina do not start with a victory against opponents who are making their Copa America debut.\n\nThe Canadians will want to prove they belong at this level, though, as they eye progress from a group which also includes Peru and Chile. Canada are also continuing their preparations as co-hosts, alongside the US and Mexico, for the 2026 World Cup.\n\nArgentina boss Lionel Scaloni opted to leave Leonardo Balerdi and Angel Correa out of his squad for the Copa America but he does still have plenty of experience and talent at his disposal.\n\nAston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez remains their No.1, while former Manchester City defender Nicolas Otamendi, who is now 36, is expected to be paired at centre-back with Tottenham's Cristian Romero in what looks like being a solid back-line for the opener.\n\nFernandez, Mac Allister and Paredes are reportedly battling to start alongside Atletico Madrid's Rodrigo De Paul in midfield for the defending champions, with one of those aforementioned players set to miss out on a place in the XI.\n\nSkipper Messi, also 36, will be after more international goals to add to his impressive tally of 108 for his country in what may prove to be his final international tournament and he will start in a fearsome front three alongside Fiorentina's Nicolas Gonzalez and Man City's Julian Alvarez.\n\nCanada will hope to rely on Bayern defender Davies, who is likely to be part of a back-three alongside Colorado Rapids' Moise Bombito and Derek Cornelius, who plays his football in Sweden for Malmo.\n\nPorto's Stephen Eustaquio and Watford's Kone will likely be selected in midfield for Canada, with David, who has 26 goals from 48 international appearances, their main attacking threat.\n\nArgentina (4-3-3): Martinez; Molina, Romero, Otamendi, Acuna; Mac Allister, Paredes, De Paul;

To celebrate the start of the event, the developers at Electronic Arts have launched a new set of mystery Objectives in EA Sports FC 24. To complete these five Objectives, you'll need to use specific player cards to complete various in-game tasks. If you don't know which cards to use, you'll be left out to dry because EA Sports FC 24 has turned several of these Objectives into riddles players need to puzzle out. Below, you'll find a full list of answers for the Copa America Throwback Objective, giving you an easy way to learn all the answers and wrap up this Objective group quickly in EA Sports FC 24.\n\nAll Copa America Throwback Objectives in EA Sports FC 24\n\nAs mentioned, there are five Objectives to complete to finish the Copa America Throwback. Two of them require you to solve puzzles Electronic Arts has given. That makes this Objective group a bit easier than the EURO Throwback group EA dropped last week, but you still need to use specific players. It's worth noting that if you don't have those players, you can try to use them in a Draft mode. That worked with last week's Objective, so you'll probably be able to do the same. Here are all of the answers for the Copa America Throwback Objective:\n\nBuzzing in Bolivia - As the host nation in 1963, Bolivia had a lot to play for.

My own team-mates said: 'I want to win the World Cup more because of him'. I've always been grateful for the love I've received in my career.\"\n\n\"It's football and it happens. Everything happens for a reason and everything is written. If it has to be, it's going to be. It's already marked. God had it in store that it had to be this way.\"\n\n\"I don't know what's going to happen two years from now, I don't know how I'm going to be physically, if I'm going to be able to continue contributing, that's why I don't know if I'm going to be there.\"\n\n\"It's a shame [about his injury that will keep him out of this Copa America]. Brazil have a million players. They've got plenty, because they're always bringing players through. Even if Ney is not here, they have a million options. Brazil is a very strong and very competitive team.\"\n\n\"I live day by day and I don't think about what might happen. Even though age is a number, I feel very good.\"\n\n\"Here we stay up late. We play a lot of truco. I defend myself and I like it. I'm conservative. We play in threes. I usually play with Rodrigo De Paul and Leandro Paredes. I value him a lot and in a way I'm going to miss him.\"\n\n\"Just yesterday, I lost a little game in training and I got annoyed. I like to win, to compete. At one point, I get a bit moody, I get agitated and, after a while, it goes away and I ask myself why the f**k did I get agitated like that. It happens to me with the games at Inter Miami.\"\n\n\"During the games I don't say anything to them. Afterwards, we talk, we comment. But it also depends on the moment and how you tell them. The three of them are different in character. Thiago is much more sensitive and if you say something bad to him he assimilates it in a worse way. He's more susceptible, but he already realises when he does something wrong or right and looks for me to talk to. Not Mateo. I can tell him anything and he doesn't give a s**t about what I say, good or bad. He takes it the same way. Ciro is the most similar to me in terms of character. He has elements of my character\".", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_Tinelli", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marcelo Tinelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Ramos", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Ramos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_De_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rodrigo De Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leandro_Paredes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leandro Paredes"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/5bd7f5683b2d8d1a644a8b4c96acad6f/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/06/19/17187904856595.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658543", "eventUri": "eng-9658543", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 267, "textEnd": 274}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

OneFootball's predictions for the Copa Am\u00e9rica", "body": "This article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence. You can read the original version in Spanish here. Let us know in the comments what you think of this translation.\n\nA few hours separate us from the start of the most important tournament on the American continent. The Copa Am\u00e9rica brings together the best 16 teams from Conmebol and Concacaf, who will give their all on the field to claim the title.\n\nThe teams believed to be the \"dark horses\" are Costa Rica and Ecuador. The Ticos have their hopes pinned on the young forward Manfred Ugalde, who, after a great stint in the Eredivisie, has landed in Russian football and hopes the Copa Am\u00e9rica will be the tournament where he can make a significant impact. The Ecuadorians are similarly banking on young talents like Mois\u00e9s Caicedo and Kendry Paez. If the coach can position his pieces well, Ecuador might surprise everyone.\n\nOneFootball's editorial team has two candidates: Mexico and Brazil. The Mexicans are no longer the \"giants\" of Concacaf, and their last performance in the Qatar 2022 World Cup left many doubts. They are undergoing a generational change, and the inexperience of their strategist might lead to one of the worst performances by the Tricolor in the Copa Am\u00e9rica. Brazil, on the other hand, is full of stars but has struggled to gel on the field. The absences of Neymar, Ederson, and Casemiro are significant. Additionally, the Canarinha lost their last three matches in the Conmebol qualifiers, putting a lot of pressure on the squad.\n\nThe world's eyes will be on the tournament's top figures: Messi and Vin\u00edcius Jr. After winning the World Cup in 2022, the Argentine star wants to lead his team to another title and, why not, achieve the continental championship again. Meanwhile, the Brazilian hopes to transfer his success at Real Madrid to his national team and secure his first championship with the \"Scratch du Oro.\" Both are poised to be the stars of the tournament.\n\nHistorically, Brazil is the favorite, but currently (and according to OneFootball's editorial team), Argentina is the \"chosen\" one to lift the title. Argentina is seeking their 16th Copa Am\u00e9rica, while the Brazilians are aiming for their 10th title.\n\nAt OneFootball, we have our predictions, but we look forward to reading your comments...", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Ugalde", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manfred Ugalde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Costa Rica national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Costa Rica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Costa Rica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mois\u00e9s_Caicedo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mois\u00e9s Caicedo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S\u00e3o_Paulo_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S\u00e3o Paulo FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ederson_(footballer,_born_1993)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ederson (footballer, born 1993)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin\u00edcius_J\u00fanior", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casemiro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casemiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neymar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neymar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/onefootball_articles_802/2d759c14b0d9db1407bc31954b9a14f7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658543", "eventUri": "eng-9658543", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

Every match will be available on Premier Sports.\n\nKey dates to note\n\nThe key date from the group stage for Liverpool fans is definitely July 3 at 2am, when Alisson's Brazil take on Colombia in their final group match.\n\nAside from that, we would recommend Mac Allister's Argentina vs. Chile on June 26 at 2am, and Nunez's Uruguay vs. USA on July 2 at 2am.\n\nThe young left-sided defender was a key figure in this season's unbeaten Bundesliga campaign, and will start for Ecuador alongside another Liverpool-linked defender, William Pacho.\n\nRepeatedly linked in the German press, speculation over the Frankfurt defender has \"substance,\" according to Merseyside journalist Neil Jones.\n\nPacho is particularly dominant on the ground and is strong in possession, which suggests he could settle in quickly to the system employed by Arne Slot.\n\nLuis Suarez will be in the US with Uruguay but now, at 37 years old, he may not start, with Nunez preferred up front by manager Bielsa.\n\nHowever, that hasn't stopped Nunez giving the No. 9 shirt back to Suarez on his return to the squad.\n\nElsewhere, former Liverpool youngster Liam Millar will be at the tournament with Canada, who are in a group with Argentina.\n\nThe forward played just once for the first team, against Shrewsbury in 2020, before moving permanently to Basel in 2021. Last season, he enjoyed a year on loan at Preston in which he played 36 times.\n\nHe even made an appearance at the most recent World Cup, coming on for the last nine minutes in a 1-0 defeat to Belgium.", "source": {"uri": "thisisanfield.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "This Is Anfield"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_millne@thisisanfield.com", "name": "Sam Millne", "type": "author",

Substitute rules for concussions and replacements for head injuries", "body": "The 2024 Copa America is underway. In total, 16 teams are ready to do battle as they aim to win one of the most prestigious tournaments in world football.\n\nTen CONMEBOL teams and six invited nations from CONCACAF will compete in the United States from June 20-July 14 for continental glory and bragging rights.\n\nFans will expect the usual high drama and entertainment that comes with the best national teams from the region gathering every four years, but this tournament will also be a little different. As well as being expanded to 16 teams, ahead of the 2024 kickoff the South American football governing body also announced a major change to the substitute rules for the tournament, most notably introducing the use of a pink card by referees as well as the traditional yellow and red.\n\nHere, The Sporting News explains what it is and how it will work at Copa America 2024, along with all the rules for substitution regulations at the tournament finals.\n\nMORE: Copa America bracket, full schedule of matches and latest results, updated LIVE\n\nThe pink card at Copa America 2024 will be used by the referee to signal for a substitution in the event of a suspected head trauma or concussion.\n\nEach team can make concussion substitutes independent of the five permitted regular substitutions they are allowed during matches at the tournament. The rule is designed to protect player welfare.\n\nOnce a concussion substitution has been taken, the opposing team will also have the opportunity to make a sixth substitution.\n\nThe competition's governing body, CONMEBOL, has also confirmed that players suspected of suffering a concussion will not be able to return to the field and that they will be assessed in the dressing room or taken to a hospital, if required.\n\nTeam doctors will then be required to submit a complete concussion assessment report within 24 hours of the end of the match in which the suspected head injury happened.\n\nCONMEBOL have also confirmed that for this year's tournament in USA, teams can make up to five 'regular' (non-concussion related) substitutions during 90 minutes.\n\nCoaches must utilize these in a maximum of three stoppages in play per team (which excludes half-time and other match delays).\n\nIt's worth noting that if subs are made during any drinks break for hot or humid weather, these will be counted as stoppages.\n\nIf a game goes into extra time, teams can make one extra substitution, with one extra stoppage of play per team allowed in that extra period. If a team has already used all their substitutions, and a player must come off the pitch due to injury (non-concussion related), the club will have to finish the match with 10 men.\n\nA player who has been subbed off the pitch is not allowed to later be brought back on.\n\nAny unused substitutes from regulation time (90 minutes) are carried over into extra time; for example, if a side only made four substitutions in 90 minutes, they will have the luxury to make a double change in extra time.\n\nThese changes align with the substitution regulations introduced in major domestic football leagues and recent international competitions. The aim is to reduce the increased risk of player injuries and burnout due to fixture congestion, which resulted from the postponement of previous tournaments because of COVID-19.\n\nMORE: FIFA Ranking for all Copa America sides\n\nTeams at this summer's men's Copa America tournament have been allowed to name rosters of up to 26 players, instead of the usual 23.\n\nThat decision was confirmed by CONMEBOL following a meeting held in Thailand on May 16.\n\nDespite the expanded overall squad, the maximum number of delegation members on the sidelines on match days (including players and coaching staff) will remain at 23. For example, if a side chooses to field 26 players, 11 on the field and 15 on the bench, the maximum number of staff on the bench should be eight.\n\nA similar decision for this summer's European Championship in Germany was announced in April, even though FIFA decided to stick with 23-player rosters during the most recent men's and women's World Cups.\n\nMORE: Copa America winners, who has won the trophy before?\n\nTeams had to provide CONMEBOL with a final list containing a maximum of 26 players by the squad deadline of June 12, 2024, a week prior to the start of the tournament.\n\nAfter the final lists are submitted, teams can only make late replacements and withdrawals for serious injuries, illnesses, or medical reasons up to 24 hours before their first match in the competition.\n\nBut once Copa America 2024 is up and running, teams must find alternative solutions from within their submitted 26-man squads.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType":

A full Brazil international at just 17, Endrick has already earned comparisons to Selecao strikers of the past and is a player bursting with potential.\n\nAfter becoming the youngest player to appear for Palmeiras, the teenager has since hit 21 goals in 82 appearances for the Brazilian side and does not turn 18 until next month. For Brazil, he's also made an instant impact.\n\nA debut goal arrived in a friendly win over England in March - becoming the youngest player to score an international goal at Wembley - and has been followed with further strikes against Spain and Mexico in preparation for this summer's tournament.\n\nIconic Performances: A teenage Pel\u00e9 conquers the world\n\nIf this is to be Lionel Messi's farewell for Argentina, it is perhaps a fitting stage. The United States - where Messi-mania has taken a grip after his move to MLS and Inter Miami - will host the Copa America as the La Albiceleste aim for back-to-back titles.\n\nGone are the ghosts of past disappointments in the blue and white of the national team, with successes at the 2021 Copa America, 2022 Finalissima and 2022 World Cup completing the set for Messi.\n\nThe eight-time Ballon d'Or winner has 14 goals in 15 games for Inter Miami in 2024 and plenty of the old magic remains.\n\nMessi, Qatar, and the fulfilment of a football fairytale\n\nKendry P\u00e1ez will be the youngest player in the tournament with the Ecuadorian having only turned 17 last month. Such is the standing in which the midfielder is held, he has already won eight caps for the senior national team and opened his account for Ecuador in a World Cup qualifier against Bolivia in October.\n\nEcuador have an exciting collection of young talent that includes Chelsea midfielder Moises Caicedo and Bundesliga defensive duo Piero Hincapi\u00e9 and Willian Pacho, each of whom have attracted Premier League interest. Paez is one player already set for English football, having agreed a deal to sign for Chelsea upon turning 18 next year.\n\nSantiago Gimenez will lead the line for a Mexico team that enter the tournament in mixed form, having lost three of their last four fixtures. However, El Tricolor possess a goalscorer coveted across Europe with Gimenez having been a prolific presence for Feyenoord across the last two seasons.\n\nThe 23-year-old endured a slow start in the Eredivisie after arriving from Cruz Azul, scoring just twice before the winter break in 2022-23. From there, however, his numbers have been phenomenal. Gimenez ended that debut campaign with 23 goals in all competitions and added another 26 for the Rotterdam outfit this season.\n\nHe turned down the opportunity to represent Argentina, the nation of his birth, in favour of adorning Mexico's colours and follows in the footsteps of his father who won five caps for the national team.\n\nA strong tournament will lengthen his list of suitors, while Gimenez will want to improve on a modest record of four goals from 27 caps to date.\n\nDarwin Nunez remains the enigma Liverpool are yet to solve with two seasons in a red shirt having seen the forward frustrate and delight in equal measure.\n\nThe 24-year-old appeared to make strides of progress in 2023-24 as he returned 18 goals and 13 assists in all competitions, though he lost his place in the team across the run-in and remains erratic around goal.\n\nNunez has the raw ingredients to be an elite number nine and has started to become the main man for Uruguay. He has scored eight goals in his last seven caps, is the leading scorer in South America's 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification phase, and netted a hat-trick in a warm-up win over Mexico this month.\n\nWith a new manager in Arne Slot to impress at Liverpool, Nunez will hope to make a big impact this summer.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo

They dominated Paraguay 3-0 at Buenos Aires' Monumental Stadium.\n\nTrailing behind, Brazil boasts nine championships. Their latest conquest was in 2019, overcoming Peru 3-1 in a thrilling final, again at the Maracan\u00e3.\n\nOthers linger in the backdrop. Paraguay, Chile, and Peru have each nabbed the title twice. Colombia and Bolivia trail with a solitary victory each.\n\nThis year's tournament unfolds in the United States, featuring a compelling opener between Argentina, the 2022 World Cup champions, and Canada.

the stage for the grand finale on July 14.\n\nThis clash of football elites not only celebrates sport but also stitches together a tapestry of national pride and regional rivalries.\n\nThe Copa

The interesting thing here is that even this tournament will join the current furor over the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and this will be a fundamental part of the applied technology, but not the only one.\n\nFrom in-depth game analysis to optimizing the fan experience, AI and video surveillance cameras will play a crucial role in this tournament. Today we will give a brief review of each of these new features that have already been officially announced.\n\nIt is a fact that this tournament, from the perspective of the technology it will implement, will be one of the most relevant in history.\n\nAccording to a detailed article by colleagues at Sports ShowcaseOn the playing field, VAR (video referee) technology will be reinforced with stereoscopic 3D vision systems, allowing referees to make more precise and fair decisions in controversial plays. This will minimize controversial errors and ensure a smoother flow of the match.\n\nAt the same time, the television broadcasts of the Copa Am\u00e9rica 2024 will offer images 4K high quality, giving fans a more immersive and exciting visual experience. Furthermore, the use of interfaces Augmented reality will integrate real-time statistics and interactive replays, further enriching the viewer experience.\n\n\"Video cameras, accompanied by artificial intelligence (AI), will play a crucial role in the Copa Am\u00e9rica 2024. On the field, these tools will allow exhaustive analysis of the game, with new video systems that allow stereoscopic 3D views of the action, facilitating the making of more precise referee decisions and avoiding controversial errors that could affect the development of the match. Meanwhile, off the field, video surveillance cameras will also play a fundamental role in ensuring safety and optimizing the fan experience,\" said Michael Luman (Product Manager) of Dahua Technology.\n\nIn fact, Artificial Intelligence will also be used off the field, to optimize the logistics and security of the event. Since crowd management systems with predictive analysis will be implemented to avoid crowds and guarantee the safety of attendees.\n\nFans will also be able to enjoy different mobile applications specially designed for the Copa Am\u00e9rica 2024, which will offer exclusive content, live surveys and interactive experiences, encouraging greater participation and inclusion in the tournament. But it should be noted that None of them are exactly official.\n\nSo the tournament will mark a milestone in the integration of cutting-edge technology in football, with tools that will not only benefit this competition, but will also lay the foundation for a more technologically advanced future in the world of sports in general.\n\nIn a way the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica will serve as a laboratory to test and evaluate these new technologies and in that aspect the tournament will also be very exciting.", "source": {"uri": "bullfrag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bullfrag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jaxon_miles@bullfrag.com", "name": "Jaxon Miles", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stereoscopy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_replay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instant replay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Augmented reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahua_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dahua Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Companies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://www.fayerwayer.com/resizer/v2/6AU522E7PFFOTEQKEUP2CWGICE.jpeg?smart=true&auth=74488501a35af805cbf2d1a590bb4330e5da6dcbcc089cec55d39c46ea712532&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658543", "eventUri": "eng-9658543", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 86, "relevance": 1}

You can read the original version in Brazilian Portuguese here. Let us know in the comments what you think of this translation.\n\nDorival J\u00fanior had the chance to rotate the Brazilian National Team squad in the last tests before the Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\nThe coach used 23 out of the 26 players called up in the two friendlies, with a 3-2 win over Mexico and a 1-1 draw with the United States.\n\nOnly goalkeepers Bento and Rafael and defender Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es did not take the field in these two matches.\n\nWith the Copa Am\u00e9rica in sight, it is time to analyze who's on the rise and who's falling after these two friendlies.\n\nEndrick \u2b06\ufe0f\n\nPlayed 29 minutes against Mexico and 25 minutes against the USA, coming off the bench in both games.\n\nDespite this, he scored the goal that saved the team against the Mexicans with a precise header in the 50th minute of the second half.\n\nDorival Jr. has been cautious with the 17-year-old, but Endrick shows he can be very useful in the Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\nRodrygo \u2b06\ufe0f\n\nHe is the second most important player on the Brazilian National Team, only behind Vini Jr.\n\nWith his Real Madrid teammate being somewhat subdued (see below), it was up to Rodrygo to take on the responsibility up front.\n\nHe didn't play against Mexico but was the best player on the field against the USA, scoring Brazil's only goal.\n\nHowever, the Girona forward has given the coach something to think about, especially with his performance in the first game.\n\nEven if he starts the Copa Am\u00e9rica on the bench, he is an interesting option to add speed to the attack and change the game.\n\nRaphinha \u2b06\ufe0f\n\nDespite Savinho's good performance, he may not become a starter because his main competitor also stood out.\n\nThe Barcelona forward assisted Rodrygo in scoring Brazil's goal in the 1-1 draw with the United States.\n\nAdditionally, especially at the beginning of the match, he was actively involved, took shots from outside the box, and troubled the opposing defense.\n\nAlisson \u2b07\ufe0f\n\nUntil recently, he was an (almost) undisputed starter as the goalkeeper for the Brazilian National Team. Today, however, the scenario is different.\n\nEven with \u00c9derson injured, some fans are questioning Alisson and calling for Bento to be the starter.\n\nThe three goals conceded in the two friendlies -- especially the goal by the USA -- have increased the criticism.\n\nAfter the mistake on Wednesday (12th), he made good saves to prevent a loss. So, does Alisson deserve to be the starter?\n\nLucas Paquet\u00e1 \u2b07\ufe0f\n\nHe reported to the Brazilian National Team amid news of an investigation into alleged misconduct related to betting.\n\nOff-field issues seem to have affected him. He lost the ball, leading to Mexico's first goal.\n\nHe couldn't replicate his previous intensity. With strong competition, Paquet\u00e1 starts the Copa Am\u00e9rica with his spot under threat.\n\nVini Jr \u2b07\ufe0f\n\nHe is the star of the Brazilian National Team, an undisputed starter, and a favorite for the 2024 Ballon d'Or.\n\nBecause of all this, fans expected more from him. He couldn't shine against the United States.\n\nTo make matters worse, he missed a clear chance that would have given Brazil the victory in the final moments.\n\nHe needs to regain his top-level form to lead Brazil to the title and get closer to individual awards.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brazil national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrygo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rodrygo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorival_J\u00fanior", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dorival J\u00fanior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Magalh\u00e3es", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphinha", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raphinha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girona_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Girona FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisson_Becker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alisson Becker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c9derson_(footballer,_born_1999)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u00c9derson (footballer, born 1999)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Paquet\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucas Paquet\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/onefootball_articles_802/c80ee0d2ad01325d5c089f1eb155401b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658543", "eventUri": "eng-9658543", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 78, "relevance": 1}

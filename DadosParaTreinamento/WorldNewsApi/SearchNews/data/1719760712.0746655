{"id": 225029108, "title": "I work remotely all the way from Australia and it heals my homesickness", "text": "Working from home became a new frontier during the pandemic, and many people now feel they could never return to a five day week in the office if they have proven they can do their job just as well from home. The idea of the \u2018digital nomad\u2019 takes working from home to a new level, combining working remotely with travelling. It\u2019s something that travel journalists and influencers have been doing for years, but now people in all sectors can have that opportunity thanks to remote working policies that were developed amid the difficult days of Covid-19. Becca McLoughlin is one such remote worker - but she has taken the idea of working from home to new heights - 30,000 feet high, to be exact, as it\u2019s a long flight home from where she has taken her career. When Becca made the decision to move from Ireland to Sydney, Australia, she was so sad that her decision meant it was time to part ways with her employer 11PR. However, she was over the moon to discover that 11PR & Events Director Emma Fitzpatrick was able to offer her a remote working option while she took on the new challenge of travelling. \u201cIt was the best of both worlds!\u201d Becca told RSVP Live. Her job as a social media manager meant that her phone was her key tool in her work anyway, and the beauty of her role is the freedom and flexibility that comes with that. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a role that requires you to be sitting at your desk from Monday - Friday 9-5. Our time differences range from 9-11 hours apart so while the team is working, I\u2019m sleeping and vice versa. I can imagine how this would be super difficult for a collaborative role to adjust to but because my role doesn\u2019t require much input from the wider team, we are able to work at different ends of the clock,\u201d she noted. \u201cIt\u2019s the joys of having such a flexible job that doesn\u2019t require you to be at a desk all day. A lot of my role is based on my phone so I could be working at home one day or The Whitsundays the next.\u201d Australia always had a pull for Becca, and was top of her bucket list after hearing from people she knew how fabulous it could be. \u201cAustralia, and Sydney in particular, was always a location I had in mind. Anyone I knew that lived in Sydney absolutely loved it and I think that\u2019s proven with the amount of Irish people currently living here. I love holidaying in the sun so I have to admit the weather played a huge factor in my decision! There\u2019s nothing quite like spending your days off on the beach, and being promised blue skies,\u201d she said. However, she won't be stationary in Sydney, with plans to use her newfound location to access corners of the world that would be very far-flung if venturing from Ireland: \u201cI\u2019m currently settled in Sydney, but have plans to travel the rest of Australia and also South East Asia very soon.\u201d Moving halfway across the world is a challenge in itself, particularly given the huge time difference between Ireland and Australia. That, coupled with changing time differences while travelling to different countries, may seem like a challenge, but Becca has found ways to optimise being in a different time zone. She said: \u201c As much as I try to check in a few times a week during Irish working hours to be in the loop, working at different ends of the clock can be still beneficial for us all.\u201d \u201cIt means that if any of the girls in the Irish office have a task that needed to be done towards the end of their working day, I can pick it up and have it back to them by their following morning - it\u2019s like we\u2019re an unofficial 24 hour office.\u201d However, there have been some growing pains along the way of course. Getting her head around the time zones when scheduling social media posts was an initial learning curve. \u201cScheduling social media posts with the time difference was so difficult for the first few weeks. As all the social media pages I run are based in Ireland, I have to schedule them for a time that worked for the Irish algorithm while I was working on an Australian algorithm. I got there in the end thankfully, but it wasn\u2019t something I was expecting to run into!\u201d Becca stays in the loop with the rest of the 11PR team by making communication a priority, checking in at various times and hopping into meetings where she can. Despite this, she and Emma have established a healthy work-life balance for her, so that she can create a good routine in her new locations. \u201cI think establishing a healthy work-life balance from the get go is so important,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat worked for me is setting specific hours each week that I dedicated to work, it helped create a solid routine and realistic expectations for myself.\u201d Irish ex-pats in Oz often complain of homesickness - being surrounded by many other Irish people for the most part, but still not actually being home can be a tough and conflicting emotional rollercoaster. Becca says that being on the clock for an Irish company really \u201cheals\u201d any tendency towards homesickness. \u201cI actually think it heals it! I would have had serious FOMO from all the amazing projects that 11PR have taken on this year if I wasn\u2019t still involved. I love keeping up to date with the Irish showbiz and latest trends so it really is the best of both worlds. Catching up with everyone in the Irish office is such a treat and has really helped Sydney feel like a home away from home.\u201d Follow 11PR & Events on Instagram to keep up with their projects.", "summary": "Working from home became a new frontier during the pandemic, and many people now feel they could never return to a five day week in the office if they have proven they can do their job just as well from home.", "url": "https://www.rsvplive.ie/life/travel/work-remotely-way-australia-heals-32916766", "image": "https://i2-prod.rsvplive.ie/incoming/article32916738.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_image0jpeg.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:42:24", "author": "Sarah Magliocco", "authors": ["Sarah Magliocco"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.121}

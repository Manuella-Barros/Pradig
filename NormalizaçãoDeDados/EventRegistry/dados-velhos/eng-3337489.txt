It was August of 1790 when President George Washington signed an act authorizing the construction of ten vessels to enforce federal tariff and trade laws and to prevent smuggling. Originally known as the \"revenue cutters\" the service grew with the country and expanded in both mission and size. It would be difficult to detail here everything the Coast Guard accomplishes and the multitude of lives saved by the dedicated men and women who work to fulfill those missions but a brief history would be appropriate as we celebrate this vital service.\n\nAn act of Congress in 1915 combined the services of the revenue cutters with the U. S. Life-Saving Service which then became known as the United States Coast Guard. The Coast Guard picked up the additional duty of maintaining aids to maritime navigation, including lighthouses, in 1939 with an order by President Franklin Roosevelt. Merchant Marine licensing and merchant vessel safety and navigation became Coast Guard responsibly in 1946. From that point forward the country has had a single maritime federal agency dedicated to saving lives at sea and enforcing the nation's maritime laws.\n\nThe Coast Guard is one of the oldest organizations of the federal government and, until Congress established the Navy Department in 1798, was the nation's only armed force afloat. The Coast Guard is now part of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nSector Columbia River headquarters is based at Astoria Regional Airport in Warrenton and executes virtually the full range of Coast Guard missions along 420 miles of coastline, 465 miles of inland water systems and 33 ports with a workforce of 500 Active Duty, 105 Reserve, 29 Civilian and 890 volunteer Auxiliary personnel. Additionally, the local area is home to three Coast Guard Cutters. The Alert and the Steadfast are homeported at the 17th Street Dock and the Fir is a 225-foot sea-going buoy tender based at the Tongue Point Aids To Navigation Team Astoria. Station Cape Disappointment and the National Motor Lifeboat School are based nearby in Washington State.\n\nBoth active duty and retired Coast Guard personnel participate in the community creating a unique leadership pool of individuals who contribute significantly to the local quality of life. Astoria is an official Coast Guard City due in part to the welcoming attitude toward Coast Guard families here.\n\nOn Monday, August 7 Astoria Mayor Arline LaMear will read a proclamation recognizing the Coast Guard's 227th birthday recognizing the vital missions the organization performs every day.", "eventUri": "eng-3337489", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-04", "title": "Happy 227th Coast Guard!", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-04", "id": "15404817", "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-04", "textStart": 69, "amb": false, "textEnd": 83}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 2461, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2469, "date": "2017-08-07"}], "storyUri": "eng-3337489", "time": "16:30:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astoria, Oregon"}, "id": "233777", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Astoria, Oregon"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astoria,_Oregon", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "id": "235649", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}, "type": "org", "id": "303299"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}, "type": "org", "id": "304056"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}, "type": "org", "id": "304059"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}, "type": "org", "id": "304957"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea", "label": {"eng": "Sea"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "306965"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "309353"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

any danger to residents along the Gulf Coast in Mississippi and Louisiana, Coast Guard Petty Officer 3rd Class Travis Magee said the Coast Guard was monitoring the situation and ES&H would be

Vast distances between communities combined with a lack of technological infrastructure makes getting information to rural communities a challenge.\n\nFor North Slope residents in Utqia\u0121ivk, formerly known as Barrow, Alaska, this remains true. Though not as remote as other surrounding villages, the Coast Guard understands this lack of communication and looks to inform the public, government responders and stakeholders.\n\nA group of 15 Coast Guard members from Coast Guard District 17, Coast Guard Sector Anchorage and the National Strike Force Pacific Strike Team landed at the single-terminal airport in Utqia\u0121ivk, July 24. The team quickly piled into long-bed pickup trucks and made their way down muddy, unpaved roads to their hotel in preparation for the days to come.\n\nThe Coast Guard and several statewide oil spill removal organizations, conducted a three-day oil spill response seminar July 25-27 with the common goal to inform North Slope community residents, responders and elders with awareness on North Slope oil spill preparedness, planning and response operations.\n\nThe seminar took place at Barrow High School, usually home to about 240 students but currently on summer break.\n\n\"This is the northernmost city in the United States with a population of about 4,500 people,\" said Lt. Cmdr. Jereme Altendorf, planning specialist at Coast Guard Sector Anchorage. \"We do this seminar for the people, the community. We plan hard and train harder and hope to provide assurance that we are capable to respond to an oil spill in the North Slope environment.\"\n\nAttendees gathered in the school's auditorium where speakers at the seminar discussed environmental law, Incident Command System, the science of oil spills, oil spill recovery on ice, alternative response technologies, oiled wildlife operations, historic site preservation, international issues related to oil spills, local response teams and their resources.\n\nOn the final day of the seminar, an oil spill equipment deployment demonstration was held at the beach near the borough's fuel supply. This provided a visual to better demonstrate the Coast Guard and partner agencies' capabilities and readiness in the case of an on-water or shore side spill.\n\nDuring the demonstration, the Coast Guard assisted members of Alaska Chadux Coporation in deploying a Beach Deluge Response System. The system works by flooding the beach with water causing fuel to rise to the surface and subsequently skimmers and absorbent products are used to complete cleanup.\n\n\"It makes it real,\" said Altendorf. \"Doing the live demonstration in their city, in their water, makes all the difference because it reminds them that the potential of a spill is always possible and we need to be ready to respond.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time the Coast Guard has conducted similar training. In the past, Coast Guard members have gone to places like Kotzebue and Nome, Alaska, to inform the public but those trainings only lasted a day. With the amount of positive feedback received, the Coast Guard decided to extend the training in Utqia\u0121ivk to three days.\n\n\"We hope to continue evolving this training based off lessons learned and interactions with the community,\" said Altendorf. \"At the end of the day, if we leave knowing we reached five or 500 people, I feel like our mission was accomplished.\"", "eventUri": "eng-3337489", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-03", "title": "Coast Guard brings oil spill response assurance to North Slope residents", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-03", "id": "15235927", "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-07-25", "textStart": 1019, "amb": false, "imp": true, "dateEnd": "2017-07-27", "textEnd": 1029}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 741, "amb": false, "textEnd": 748, "date": "2017-07-24"}], "storyUri": "eng-3337489", "time": "23:43:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "id": "233", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kotzebue, Alaska"}, "id": "236356", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Kotzebue, Alaska"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotzebue,_Alaska", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nome, Alaska"}, "id": "236408", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Nome, Alaska"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nome,_Alaska", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "id": "236582", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anchorage, Alaska"}, "id": "236596", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Anchorage, Alaska"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchorage,_Alaska", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barrow, Alaska"}, "id": "236610", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Barrow, Alaska"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrow,_Alaska", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "label": {"eng": "Airport"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302716"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "label": {"eng": "Water"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303000"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "label": {"eng": "Flood"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303248"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "306725"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_law", "label": {"eng": "Environmental law"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "315838"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard", "label": {"eng": "United States Coast Guard"}, "type": "org", "id": "322550"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_spill", "label": {"eng": "Oil spill"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "327156"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_Command_System", "label": {"eng": "Incident Command System"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "356447"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_North_Slope", "label": {"eng": "Alaska North Slope"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "615608"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrow_High_School", "label": {"eng": "Barrow High School"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "973149"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployable_Operations_Group", "label": {"eng": "Deployable Operations Group"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1377359"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_extreme_points_of_the_United_States", "label": {"eng": "List of extreme points of the United States"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1416331"}], "url": "https://www.dvidshub.net/news/243620/coast-guard-brings-oil-spill-response-assurance-north-slope-residents", "timeCrawl": "23:43:00", "image": "https://cdn.dvidshub.net/media/thumbs/photos/1707/3616782/1000w_q75.jpg", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-03T23:43:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.5529412031173706}

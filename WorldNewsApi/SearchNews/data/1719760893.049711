Mexico will hold national elections on June 2, 2024, sparking the urgent warning from the UK Foreign Office to Brits heading abroad. It warned: \"There may be an increase in political demonstrations and travel disruptions, such as roadblocks or disputes between supporters. Avoid demonstrations and move away quickly. Be aware of the potential for disruption and monitor local media.\" \"Political demonstrations are common in Mexico City and can happen across the country. These can be tense and confrontational and could potentially turn violent. Onlookers can be quickly drawn in. Monitor local media and avoid all demonstrations,\" it added. \"It is illegal for foreigners to participate in political activities in Mexico. Participation in demonstrations may result in detention and deportation. Politically motivated violence can happen across the country. Onlookers can be quickly drawn in. \"You should monitor local media and avoid all demonstrations. If you come across protests, move away from the area.\" Last week, nine people were killed and at least 50 others injured when a stage structure collapsed at a campaign event for the Mexican presidential candidate Jorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez. Mexico\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, said a gust of wind caused the accident in the city of San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda in the northern state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. M\u00e1ynez said: \u201cI am fine and in communication with state authorities to follow up on what happened. The only important thing right now is to care for the victims of the accident.\" Maynez is running a distant third less than two weeks before voters go to the polls on 2 June. The former Mexico City head of government Claudia Sheinbaum and X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez, an ex-mayor for the city\u2019s Miguel Hidalgo borough, are the two leading candidates.", "summary": "Mexico will hold national elections on June 2, 2024, sparking the urgent warning from the UK Foreign Office to Brits heading abroad.", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/travel/foreign-office-warns-uk-tourists-29258377", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/article29258415.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_mexico.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:23:14", "author": "James Rodger", "authors": ["James Rodger"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.199}

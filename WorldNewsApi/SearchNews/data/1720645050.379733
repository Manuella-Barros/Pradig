Speaking at the 248th-anniversary celebration of USA Independence Day at the official residence of US Ambassador Meg Whitman, Mudavadi highlighted Kenya\u2019s pivotal role in regional and continental peace and security. \u201cThe U.S. has been one of Kenya\u2019s greatest partners in enhancing regional leadership in conflict resolution and stabilization. We hold the view that to strengthen our national security, we shall require international cooperation to secure our people at home and abroad,\u201d Mudavadi said. He also noted that Kenya and the US collaborate closely on various issues at the United Nations, including peace operations and the maintenance of international peace and security as outlined in the UN Charter. Mudavadi emphasized that both countries, as democracies, work together for regional peace, security, and prosperity. \u201cKenya believes that entrenching democracy, promoting human rights, and the rule of law are the best options to achieve peace, security, stability, and sustainable development,\u201d he stated. He added that Kenya\u2019s commitment to regularly scheduled democratic elections underscores the country\u2019s belief in accountability and good governance. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1964, Kenya-US relations have grown stronger. Mudavadi highlighted the recent successful state visit by President William Ruto, which further solidified the relationship and expanded partnerships in trade, investment, security, and technology, positioning Kenya as a digital leader in the region, known as the \u2018Silicon Savannah\u2019.

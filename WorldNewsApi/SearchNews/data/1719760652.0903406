Little, Brown and Co. announced Wednesday that Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s \u201cRevenge Of the Tipping Point\u201d will be published Oct. 1. The book arrives nearly a quarter-century after Gladwell\u2019s \u201cThe Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,\u201d his million-selling debut. Little, Brown is calling \u201cRevenge of the Tipping Point\u201d a \u201cfresh perspective\u201d on a variety of social issues. \u201cWhy in the late 1980s and early \u201990s did Los Angeles become the bank robbery capital of the world? What is the Magic Third and what does it have to do with racial equity? What do big cats and clusters of teen suicide have in common?\u201d the publisher\u2019s announcement reads in part. \u201cThese are just some of the questions Malcolm Gladwell addresses in this provocative new work, which revisits the phenomenon of social epidemics and examines the ways in which we have learned to tinker with and shape the spread of ideas, viruses, and trends \u2014 sometimes with great success, sometimes with disastrous consequences.\u201d Gladwell\u2019s other books include \u201cBlink,\u201d \u201cOutliers\u201d and \u201cThe Bomber Mafia.\u201d He is also a longtime New Yorker staff writer and host of the podcast \u201cRevisionist History.\u201d", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21hbGNvbG0tZ2xhZHdlbGwtdGlwcGluZy1wb2ludC1lYzA0NGEyYjFlMTg0ODdlODNhYTY1OGU3ZWMzNjUxY9IBAA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Malcolm Gladwell takes fresh look at societal trends in 'Revenge of the Tipping Point'</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/malcolm-gladwell-tipping-point-ec044a2b1e18487e83aa658e7ec3651c", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/380a70a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1125+0+104/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Ff4%2Fac%2Fc735e3bb1d12dd25de03443baffb%2F75b9543a1c0d4d77803f85059fa4be00", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:33:10", "author": "Hillel Italie", "authors": ["Hillel Italie"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.54}

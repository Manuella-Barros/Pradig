Jacob pointed to the new Junxion brand, launched in Winnipeg in December 2022 followed by another location last May in Mississauga, Ont., stressing how arcade games can mesh with moviegoing.\n\n\"This is a combination of a movie theatre with a miniature Rec Room, and they are doing phenomenal. It helps guests come in, watch a movie and then stay, talk about it, eat, get entertained,\" he said.\n\nThe company's bet on movie-adjacent entertainment venues comes despite its recent sale of arcade game distributor Player One Amusement Group.\n\nCineplex recorded a $67.3 million gain on the deal in February, helping it swing to a $5.2 million profit for the first quarter compared with a $30.2-million loss in the first three months of 2023.\n\nRevenue from location-based entertainment actually dipped nearly two per cent year over year to $34.5 million, but executives attributed the figure to bad weather early in the year that forced some stores to close temporarily.\n\nThe box office abides as Cineplex's core revenue driver, with 158 theatres across the country. Jacob insisted that despite streaming platforms, the plunge in superhero flick sales and a lacklustre industry rebound after the COVID-19 pandemic, Canadians crave cinema.\n\n\"When the content is there, guests want to come back and they want to have that experience. We saw that with Barbenheimer in the summer of last year,\" he said.\n\nCineplex has been relying more heavily than ever on \"premium experiences\" and international films, a trend Jacob said will only grow.\n\nSome 41 per cent of box office sales last quarter came from IMAX, VIP, UltraAVX and 3D screens, according to the Toronto-based company. Another 13 per cent derived from foreign-language movies such as \"Warning 2,\" one of several Punjabi hits this year.\n\nBut the biggest lure for audiences was \"Dune: Part Two\" followed by \"Kung Fu Panda 4,\" resulting in a 0.5 per cent uptick in theatre attendance.\n\nDune director Denis Villeneuve held a press tour event in his home province of Quebec in February for the sequel film's Canadian premiere.\n\n\"The theatre where he did it -- the Scotiabank in downtown Montreal with the IMAX -- that theatre on the first weekend that the movie opened was the highest-grossing theatre in North America,\" Jacob said.\n\nThe windfall was welcome, as Cineplex looks to repay long-term debt of $731.5 million -- down 15 per cent from a year earlier thanks in part to the arcade distributor sale.\n\nJacob said he aims to reduce the company's ratio of net debt to adjusted earnings to between 2.5 and three -- within the typical range -- from about four as of Dec. 31.\n\nAdjusted earnings in the three months ended March 31 fell 60 per cent year over year to $4.6 million, \"primarily due to minimum wage increases and legal costs in the quarter related to the Competition Bureau's lawsuit against Cineplex,\" said chief financial officer Gord Nelson.\n\nCompetition commissioner Matthew Boswell has claimed that Cineplex's online booking fees, which amounted to about $39 million between June 2022 and the end of last year, are deceptive because moviegoers are not presented with the full price of a ticket on the very first webpage they encounter when buying from Cineplex.\n\nJacob told analysts Thursday: \"We strongly believe we have complied with both the letter and spirit of the law and that the Competition Bureau's allegations are unfounded.\"\n\nCineplex said revenue for its first quarter rose 1.2 per cent year over year to $294.8 million.\n\nBox office revenue per patron rose to $12.74 compared with $12.63 a year earlier, while concession revenue per patron averaged $8.95, up from $8.85 in the same quarter last year.\n\nBasic and diluted earnings hit eight cents per share, far above last year's loss of 48 cents per share and analysts' expectations of a similar outcome this time around, according to LSEG Data & Analytics.", "source": {"uri": "cp24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pulse24.com                        "}, "authors": [{"uri":

Theatre seats are shown at Cineplex Junxion Erin Mills in Mississauga, Ont., on Monday, April 24, 2023. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Nathan DenetteThe head of Cineplex Inc. is doubling down on arcades as he looks to top up revenues amid the unsteady return of audiences to theatres. Box office revenue at the country's largest cinema owner rose one per cent year over year to $125.1 million in its latest quarter, even as industry-wide North American box office sales dropped by more than five per cent. CEO Ellis Jacob has targeted \"location-based entertainment\" (LBE) - on-site experiences such as arcades and virtual reality attractions as well as old-fashioned bowling and restaurant options - as a way to diversify the company's income stream. Cineplex runs 13 such venues across the country via chains such as Playdium, The Rec Room and Junxion, with three more slated to launch in the fourth quarter. A Playdium arcade centre will open at Toronto's Fairview Mall adjacent to a Cineplex location, and two new Rec Rooms will take root in downtown Vancouver and Montreal's Royalmount mega-mall complex, Jacob said. \"Given the success of our LBE business, we believe there is an opportunity to grow to 30 locations across Canada,\" he told analysts on a conference call Thursday. Such an expansion could double annual adjusted earnings from location-based entertainment to about $75 million, Jacob said. \"We have good runway to further grow in a highly accretive, high-margin business and strengthen our position as a leading entertainment destination for Canadians.\" The company's investment in arcades and other entertainment options comes despite its recent sale of arcade game distributor Player One Amusement Group. Cineplex recorded a $67.3 million gain on the deal, swinging its profit to $5.2 million for the first quarter compared with a loss of $30.2 million in the first three months of 2023. Revenue from the location-based entertainment segment actually dipped by nearly two per cent year over year to $34.5 million last quarter, but executives attributed the figure to bad weather earlier in the year that forced some stores to close temporarily. The box office - still Cineplex's core revenue driver - relied more heavily on \"premium experiences\" and international films this year. Some 42 per cent of box office sales came from IMAX and VIP screens, the company said. Another 13 per cent derived from foreign-language movies such as Warning 2, one of several Punjabi hits in the quarter. But the biggest lure for audiences was Dune: Part Two followed by Kung Fu Panda 4, resulting in a 0.5 per cent uptick in theatre attendance. Revenue for the quarter ended March 31 totalled $294.8 million, up from $291.4 million in the same quarter last year. Box office revenue per patron rose to $12.74 compared with $12.63 a year earlier, while concession revenue per patron averaged $8.95, up from $8.85 in the same quarter last year.

Jacob pointed to the new Junxion brand, launched in Winnipeg in December 2022 followed by another location last May in Mississauga, Ont., stressing how arcade games can mesh with moviegoing.\n\n\"This is a combination of a movie theatre with a miniature Rec Room, and they are doing phenomenal. It helps guests come in, watch a movie and then stay, talk about it, eat, get entertained,\" he said.\n\nThe company's bet on movie-adjacent entertainment venues comes despite its recent sale of arcade game distributor Player One Amusement Group.\n\nCineplex recorded a $67.3 million gain on the deal in February, helping it swing to a $5.2 million profit for the first quarter compared with a $30.2-million loss in the first three months of 2023.\n\nRevenue from location-based entertainment actually dipped nearly two per cent year-over-year to $34.5 million, but executives attributed the figure to bad weather early in the year that forced some stores to close temporarily.\n\nThe box office abides as Cineplex's core revenue driver, with 158 theatres across the country. Jacob insisted that despite streaming platforms, the plunge in superhero flick sales and a lacklustre industry rebound after the COVID-19 pandemic, Canadians crave cinema.\n\n\"When the content is there, guests want to come back and they want to have that experience. We saw that with Barbenheimer in the summer of last year,\" he said.\n\nCineplex has been relying more heavily than ever on \"premium experiences\" and international films, a trend Jacob said will only grow.\n\nSome 41 per cent of box office sales last quarter came from IMAX, VIP, UltraAVX and 3D screens, according to the Toronto-based company. Another 13 per cent derived from foreign-language movies such as \"Warning 2,\" one of several Punjabi hits this year.\n\nBut the biggest lure for audiences was \"Dune: Part Two\" followed by \"Kung Fu Panda 4,\" resulting in a 0.5 per cent uptick in theatre attendance.\n\nDune director Denis Villeneuve held a press tour event in his home province of Quebec in February for the sequel film's Canadian premiere.\n\n\"The theatre where he did it -- the Scotiabank in downtown Montreal with the IMAX -- that theatre on the first weekend that the movie opened was the highest-grossing theatre in North America,\" Jacob said.\n\nThe windfall was welcome, as Cineplex looks to repay long-term debt of $731.5 million -- down 15 per cent from a year earlier thanks in part to the arcade distributor sale.\n\nJacob said he aims to reduce the company's ratio of net debt to adjusted earnings to between 2.5 and three -- within the typical range -- from about four as of Dec. 31.\n\nOn Thursday, Cineplex reported revenue for the quarter ended March 31 rose 1.2 per cent year-over-year to $294.8 million.\n\nBox office revenue per patron rose to $12.74 compared with $12.63 a year earlier, while concession revenue per patron averaged $8.95, up from $8.85 in the same quarter last year.\n\nBasic and diluted earnings hit eight cents per share, far above last year's loss of 48 cents per share and analysts' expectations of a similar outcome this time around, according to LSEG Data & Analytics.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published May 9, 2024.\n\nCompanies in this story:

Another 13 per cent derived from foreign-language movies such as Warning 2, one of several Punjabi hits in the quarter.\n\nBut the biggest lure for audiences was Dune: Part Two followed by Kung Fu Panda 4, resulting in a 0.5 per cent uptick in theatre attendance.\n\nRevenue for the quarter ended March 31 totalled $294.8 million, up from $291.4 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nBox office revenue per patron rose to $12.74 compared with $12.63 a year earlier, while concession revenue per patron averaged $8.95, up from $8.85 in the same quarter last year.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published May 9, 2024.\n\nCompanies in this story: (TSX:CGX)\n\nChristopher Reynolds, The Canadian Press", "source": {"uri": "sudbury.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sudbury.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@sudbury.com", "name": "Canadian Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "christopher_reynolds@sudbury.com", "name": "Christopher Reynolds", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cineplex_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cineplex Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arcade game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_One_Amusement_Group", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Player One Amusement Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_Jacob", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ellis Jacob"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rec_Room", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Rec Room"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_theater", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Movie theater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairview_Mall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fairview Mall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Vancouver"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu_Panda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kung Fu Panda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjabi_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punjabi language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IMAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canadian_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Canadian Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Theatre"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Coin-Op", "label": "dmoz/Games/Coin-Op", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Coin-Op/Arcade_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Coin-Op/Arcade Games", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/feeds/cp/2024/05/2024050908058-e914a23ca8f3955d384c16460b3b461ba5a4bce23f44cb9d36e1b34f55280e9d.jpg;w=650;h=433;mode=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554213", "eventUri": "eng-9554213", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-31", "textStart": 2547, "textEnd": 2555}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

That tells you when the team is behind it, the film does really well and he [Villeneuve] really put a lot of effort into it,\" Jacob recalled.\n\nCineplex increasing its box office during the first three months of the year came amid a 6 percent overall decline in the first quarter North American box office for Hollywood films, compared to 2023. Jacob added he's optimistic after attending CinemaCon about the tentpole releases to come from his major studio suppliers through to the end of the year and into 2025.\n\n\"I came out of there feeling really good about the business going forward. We've had a tough time with COVID. We've had a tough time with the strikes. But now there's an opportunity as we see it to move through to the second half of this year, and even the next number of months will be fine,\" Jacob reported.\n\nAs the Hollywood studios steered fewer movie to exhibitors during the first quarter, Cineplex also put more international movies on its screens. During the latest quarter, around 13 percent of box office revenues came from international films, led by the Punjabi language titles.\n\nJacob told THR that Cineplex was using artificial intelligence and other data analytics to better target diverse communities across Canada looking to go out to see movies from Bollywood, China and the Middle East. \"Ten years ago, I wouldn't have put a Bollywood movie in Sudbury. But now I do because there's a huge student population there,\" the Cineplex boss said of a growing movie market in northern Ontario.\n\nDuring the first quarter, total revenue at Cineplex rose 1.2 percent to $294.8 million, against $291.4 million in the prior year, while the company swung to net income in the first quarter at $5.2 million, from a loss of $30.2 million in 2023.\n\nDuring the latest quarter, Cineplex recognized a $67.3 million gain from selling Player One Amusement Group for $155 million. The proceeds were used in part to pay down debt, including extending bond maturity obligations.\n\nWeaker box office from Hollywood studio suppliers coming out of the dual strikes in Los Angeles last year had theatre attendance rising barely 1 percent to 9.81 million patrons for Cineplex.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Reporter"},

Invest in the Following 2 Ultra-High-Yield Stocks - May 2, 2024\n\nMarket volatility can lead to what are otherwise stellar long-term investments to see significant drops. More importantly, these ridiculously undervalued growth picks are often dismissed by investors thanks to that drop.\n\nOne such example of a ridiculously undervalued growth stock is Cineplex (TSX:CGX), and here's why you may want to reconsider the stock right now.\n\nCineplex is the largest entertainment company in Canada. That broad classification includes live entertainment, gaming, and its core movie theatre business.\n\nThe theatre business adheres to a century-old business model that hasn't changed much in the past century. In short, it charges admission to shows and sells concessions to patrons.\n\nThat movie-and-popcorn model has come under scrutiny over the past years, leading to a significant stock drop. In short, the issue can be traced back to the proliferation of online streaming services and the pandemic.\n\nThose issues have pushed the stock down an incredible 65% over the past five years.\n\nThankfully, things are turning up for Cineplex. In fact, in the most recent update, Cineplex posted $463.6 million in revenue, the highest quarterly revenue number ever. Part of this can be attributed to rising box office revenues fueled by blockbuster titles.\n\nThat trend is likely to continue into this next blockbuster season with a flurry of new releases. Prime examples of this include Deadpool & Wolverine, Despicable Me 4, and Bad Boys: Ride or Die.\n\nAnother key point for investors to note is Cineplex's continued efforts to diversify its revenue stream. That includes efforts both inside and outside of its theatres.\n\nInside the theatres, Cineplex has added and expanded a slew of premium services over the years with higher price points. This includes both the VIP and IMAX experiences, which coincidentally were responsible for over 40% of the company's revenue.\n\nOutside its core business, Cineplex continues to expand its entertainment portfolio through its Playdium and Rec Room brands.

The company is also set to add three more to that lineup later this year; Toronto's Fairview Mall will get a Playdium arcade, while two new Rec Rooms will come to downtown Vancouver and Montreal's Royalmount mall complex.\n\nIn a conference call, Jacobs said Cineplex aims to eventually expand to 30 of these entertainment venues across Canada. According to him, this could bring in an additional $75 million in annual revenue.\n\nStill, the box office remains Cineplex's main source of revenue, and that business actually performed better than average. In Q1 2024, the company's box office revenue rose one percent year-over $125.1 million at the box office, versus a more than five percent drop across North America.\n\nSpeaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Jacobs attributed this success, in part, to Quebecois director Denis Villeneuve's local promotion of 2024 box office leader Dune: Part Two. On February 28th, Villeneuve and star Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet hosted the Canadian premiere of the film in Montreal's Fairmount Cinema, and Jacobs said this made the theatre the highest-grossing in North America.\n\nWhat the company didn't mention, however, is its controversial online booking fees.

NON-GAAP AND OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nNational Instrument 52-112, Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures Disclosure (\"NI 52-112\") imposes obligations regarding disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP ratios, and other financial measures. Cineplex reports on certain non-GAAP measures, non-GAAP ratios, supplementary financial measures and total segment measures that are used by management to evaluate Cineplex's performance. The following measures included in this news release do not have a standardized meaning under GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other issuers. Cineplex includes these measures because management believes that they assist investors in assessing financial performance. These non-GAAP and other financial measures are used throughout this news release and are defined below.\n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures are defined in 52-112 as a financial measure disclosed that (a) depicts the historical or expected future financial performance, financial position or cash flow of an entity, (b) with respect to its composition, excludes an amount that is included in, or includes an amount that is excluded from, the composition of the most directly comparable financial measure disclosed in the primary financial statements of the entity, (c) is not disclosed in the financial statements of the entity, and (d) is not a ratio, fraction, percentage or similar representation.\n\nNON-GAAP RATIOS\n\nA non-GAAP ratio is defined by 52-112 as a financial measure disclosed that (a) is in the form of a ratio, fraction, percentage or similar representation, (b) has a non-GAAP financial measure as one or more of its components, and (c) is not disclosed in the financial statements.\n\nBelow are non-GAAP financial measures or non-GAAP ratios for continuing operations that are reported by Cineplex.\n\nEBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDAaL\n\nManagement defines EBITDA as earnings before interest income and expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the change in fair value of financial instrument, loss (gain) on disposal of assets, foreign exchange, the equity income of CDCP, and impairment, depreciation, amortization, interest and taxes of Cineplex's other joint ventures and associates. Adjusted EBITDAaL modifies adjusted EBITDA to deduct current period cash rent paid or payable related to lease obligations.\n\nSubsequent to the adoption of IFRS 16, Leases, by Cineplex effective January 1, 2019 , the calculation of EBITDA no longer includes a charge for amounts paid or payable with respect to leased property and equipment. Given the majority of Cineplex's businesses are carried on in leased premises, Cineplex introduced the measure of adjusted EBITDAaL which includes a deduction for cash rent paid/payable related to lease obligations. Cineplex's management believes that adjusted EBITDAaL is an important supplemental measure of Cineplex's profitability at an operational level and provides analysts and investors with comparability in evaluating and valuing Cineplex's performance period over period. EBITDA, adjusted for various unusual items, is also used to define certain financial covenants in Cineplex's Credit Facilities. Management calculates adjusted EBITDAaL margin by dividing adjusted EBITDAaL by total revenues.\n\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAaL are non-GAAP measures generally used as an indicator of financial performance and they should not be seen as a measure of liquidity or a substitute for comparable metrics prepared in accordance with GAAP. Cineplex's EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAaL may differ from similar calculations as reported by other entities and accordingly may not be comparable to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA or adjusted EBITDAaL as reported by other entities.\n\nAdjusted Store Level EBITDAaL Metrics\n\nCineplex reviews and reports adjusted EBITDAaL at the location level for the LBE which is calculated as total LBE revenues from all locations less the total of operating expenses of LBE, which excludes pre-opening costs and overhead relating to the management of LBE.\n\nAdjusted Store Level EBITDAaL Margin\n\nCalculated as adjusted store level EBITDAaL divided by total revenues for LBE for the period.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nSupplementary financial measures are financial measures that are not (a) presented in the financial statements and (b) is, or is intended to be, disclosed periodically to depict the historical or expected future financial performance, financial position or cash flow, that is not a non-GAAP financial measure or a non-GAAP ratio as defined in the instrument. Below are supplementary financial measures that Cineplex uses to depict its financial performance, financial position or cash flows.\n\nEarnings (loss) per Share Metrics\n\nCineplex has presented basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share net of this item to provide a more comparable loss per share metric between the current periods and prior year periods. In the non-GAAP and other financial measure, earnings is defined as net income or net loss attributable to Cineplex excluding the change in fair value of financial instruments.\n\nPer Patron Revenue Metrics\n\nCineplex reviews per patron metrics as they relate to box office revenue and theatre food service revenue such as BPP, CPP, BPP excluding premium priced product, and concession margin per patron, as these are key measures used by investors to value and assess Cineplex's performance, and are widely used in the theatre exhibition industry. Management of Cineplex defines these metrics as follows:\n\nTheatre Attendance: Theatre attendance is calculated as the total number of paying patrons that frequent Cineplex's theatres during the period.\n\nBPP: Calculated as total box office revenues divided by total paid theatre attendance for the period.\n\nBPP excluding premium priced product: Calculated as total box office revenues for the period, less box office revenues from 3D, 4DX, UltraAVX, VIP ScreenX and IMAX product; divided by total paid theatre attendance for the period, less paid theatre attendance for 3D, 4DX, UltraAVX, VIP, ScreenX and IMAX product.\n\nCPP: Calculated as total theatre food service revenues divided by total paid total theatre attendance for the period.\n\nPremium priced product: Defined as 3D, 4DX, UltraAVX, IMAX, ScreenX and VIP film product.\n\nTheatre concession margin per patron: Calculated as total theatre food service revenues less total theatre food service cost, divided by theatre attendance for the period.\n\nSame Theatre Analysis\n\nCineplex reviews and reports same theatre metrics relating to box office revenues, theatre food service revenues, theatre rent expense and theatre payroll expense, as these measures are widely used in the theatre exhibition industry as well as other retail industries.\n\nSame theatre metrics are calculated by removing the results for all theatres that have been opened, acquired, closed or otherwise disposed of subsequent to the start of the prior year comparative period. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 the impact of one location that has been opened or acquired and one location that has been closed or otherwise disposed of have been excluded, resulting in 156 theatres being included in the same theatre metrics.\n\nCost of sales percentages\n\nCineplex reviews and reports cost of sales percentages for its two largest revenue sources, box office revenues and food service revenues as these measures are widely used in the theatre exhibition industry. These measures are reported as film cost percentage and concession cost percentage, respectively, and are calculated as follows:\n\nFilm cost percentage: Calculated as total film cost expense divided by total box office revenues for the period.\n\nTheatre concession cost percentage: Calculated as total theatre food service costs divided by total theatre food service revenues for the period.\n\nLBE food cost percentage: Calculated as total LBE food costs divided by total LBE food service revenues for the period.\n\nCertain information included in this news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws.

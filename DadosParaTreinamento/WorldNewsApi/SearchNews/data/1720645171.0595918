{"id": 231358894, "title": "UNDP warns of economic losses: Central Asia faces 1.3% GDP hit, 30% crop decline by 2050", "text": "Economic losses from droughts and floods in Central Asia could reach up to 1.3% of GDP annually, while crop yields are projected to decline by 30% by 2050 if no preventive measures are implemented, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) reported. In a proactive move towards addressing the escalating risks of climate change, UNDP, in collaboration with the Ministry of Environmental Protection of Turkmenistan, has initiated a series of workshops aimed at enlightening the private sector of Turkmenistan about the imminent threats posed by climate change and the necessary adaptation measures. Under the banner of the project \"Developing a National Adaptation Planning Process in Turkmenistan\" (NAP), this initiative has garnered financial support from the Green Climate Fund (GCF), showcasing a strategic partnership focused on fortifying the nation's resilience against climate change impacts. The workshops, spanning from June 3 to 7, 2024, have been strategically dispersed across Ashgabat and Dashoguz, engaging representatives from Turkmenistan's private sector. Attendees delved into critical topics such as climate risks, water security, and the relevance of climate change for businesses operating within the country. Maya Ashirova, the Manager of the UNDP NAP project, emphasized the mounting vulnerability of the Central Asian region to climate change, elucidating how rising temperatures and erratic weather patterns are disrupting ecosystems and amplifying the frequency of extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and wildfires. Ashirova stressed the disproportionate impact of these climatic shifts on the most vulnerable communities, citing projections by the World Bank that forecast economic losses up to 1.3% of GDP per year and a 30% decrease in crop yields by 2050 in Central Asia if decisive action isn't taken promptly. Recognizing the pivotal role of the private sector in bridging the adaptation financing gap, UNDP in Turkmenistan has tailored these workshops to equip stakeholders with the requisite knowledge and tools to navigate the evolving climate landscape effectively. The workshop series, meticulously crafted after an in-depth analysis of prevailing needs and awareness levels within Turkmenistan's private sector, promises a holistic exploration of adaptation measures, drawing upon best practices, technologies, and insights gleaned from analogous contexts worldwide. Primarily targeting representatives from the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Turkmenistan, academia, and civil society stakeholders with an interest in fostering private sector engagement in adaptation endeavors, the workshops signify a crucial step towards fostering a climate-resilient business environment in Turkmenistan.

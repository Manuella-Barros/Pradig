Meakes, who owns the multimillion-dollar luxury Sydney pad where Mr Lehrmann lived on Seven Network's dime, has launched proceedings in the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal, with a conciliation listing date set for May 23 at the Civic Tower in Sydney.\n\nDuring his long-running defamation battle with the Ten network and presenter Lisa Wilkinson, Mr Lehrmann revealed he had stayed at Lady Meakes' Balgowlah property for a full year, with the exorbitant rent costs covered by Seven.\n\nSeven offered Lehrmann the luxury three-bedroom rental in exchange for an exclusive interview with the network's Spotlight program.\n\nSeven paid out $2000 a week for the northern beaches pad or more than $100,000 in total.\n\nA recent advertisement for the pad dated May 30 puts the rent at $1300 a week, a substantial $700 discount from the price forked out for Mr Lehrmann.\n\nThe reasons for Lady Meakes' legal action is unclear.\n\nMr Lehrmann's defamation trial ended when Federal Court judge Michael Lee concluded, on the balance of probabilities, that Mr Lehrmann had raped Brittany Higgins in Parliament House, granting victory to Ten.\n\nAfter leaving the Balgowlah property, Mr Lehrmann moved into a property in North Sydney that was rented by a friend.\n\nThe new proceedings add to Mr Lehrmann's growing woes.\n\nHe is currently unemployed and confronting up to $5m in legal bills.\n\nHe is also facing a rape charge in Queensland for an alleged incident in Toowoomba in 2021.\n\nHe has yet to be committed or enter a plea but it is understood he denies any wrongdoing.",

failed defamation case", "body": "Bruce Lehrmann is likely to be left millions of dollars in debt as he gets the bill today for his failed defamation action against Network Ten and journalist Lisa Wilkinson.\n\nFrom 2:15pm, Federal Court Justice Michael Lee will deliver his ruling in a costs hearing in the case.\n\nMr Lehrmann brought the case against Channel Ten and Ms Wilkinson over an interview with Brittany Higgins, in which she alleged he raped her in an office at Parliament House, although she did not name him.\n\nMr Lehrmann, who maintains his innocence, launched the action after his 2022 criminal trial for rape was abandoned with no findings against him.\n\nBut it was to no avail, because Justice Lee found that although he was defamed, Ten had proved its truth defence, finding on the balance of probabilities Mr Lehrmann had raped Ms Higgins.\n\nDuring a hearing last week Justice Lee indicated what direction he was headed in when it came to a decision over costs.\n\nMr Lehrmann will not get a bill from his own lawyers, after it was revealed yesterday he had agreed to a \"no win, no fee\" arrangement with them.\n\nBut Ten is pushing for a substantial amount, saying it is entitled to costs on an indemnity basis, which would mean they would be more fully compensated than for just the trial.\n\nPart of their argument is that Mr Lehrmann walked away from a reasonable offer to settle.\n\nBut Mr Lehrmann's lawyers questioned whether the case met the threshold for indemnity costs.\n\nMr Lehrmann's team also argued the costs should be lower because of parts of Ten's case, including a qualified privilege defence, failed.\n\nThe award of costs could run into the millions.\n\nBut it is not just costs for Mr Lehrmann that are at stake, with a dispute still running over how much of Ms Wilkinson's legal bill should be paid by Network Ten.\n\nNo figures have been mentioned, but even before the trial began Ms Wilkinson's costs were estimated at above $700,000.\n\nThat's still being worked out, with Ten suggesting it shouldn't have to pay for work that was duplicated.\n\nJustice Lee has suggested Ms Wilkinson send her bill to Network Ten, and it could work out what is in dispute.\n\nAnother seeking costs is Taylor Auerbach, the former Spotlight producer from the Seven Network, who made a last-minute appearance in the case, telling the court he had been assigned as Bruce Lehrmann's babysitter as they worked to secure an interview with him.\n\nMr Auerbach claimed Seven reimbursed Mr Lehrmann for money he spent on cocaine and sex workers.\n\nHe also testified that Mr Lehrmann gave Seven material from the brief of evidence in his criminal trial, in breach of court rules.\n\nBut Justice Lee was not impressed by his claim to recoup money for giving evidence in a reopening of the case.\n\n\"That's just not on.\"\n\nIn the meantime Bruce Lehrmann is considering an appeal, with a new legal team looking into the case.",

political staffer Bruce Lehrmann continues to build up, with his former landlord now taking him to NCAT.\n\nLady Gaenor Meakes, who owns the multimillion-dollar luxury Sydney pad where Mr Lehrmann lived on Seven Network's dime, has launched proceedings in the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal, with a conciliation listing date set for May 23 at the Civic Tower in Sydney.\n\nDuring his long-running defamation battle with the Ten network and presenter Lisa Wilkinson, Mr Lehrmann revealed he had stayed at Lady Meakes' Balgowlah property for a full year, with the exorbitant rent costs covered by Seven.\n\nTheNightlyGet in front of tomorrow's news for FREE\n\nJournalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.\n\nREAD NOW\n\nSeven offered Lehrmann the luxury three-bedroom rental in exchange for an exclusive interview with the network's Spotlight program.\n\nSeven paid out $2000 a week for the northern beaches pad or more than $100,000 in total.\n\nA recent advertisement for the pad dated May 30 puts the rent at $1300 a week, a substantial $700 discount from the price forked out for Mr Lehrmann.\n\nThe reasons for Lady Meakes' legal action is unclear.\n\nMr Lehrmann's defamation trial ended when Federal Court judge Michael Lee concluded, on the balance of probabilities, that Mr Lehrmann had raped Brittany Higgins in Parliament House, granting victory to Ten.\n\nAfter leaving the Balgowlah property, Mr Lehrmann moved into a property in North Sydney that was rented by a friend.\n\nThe new proceedings add to Mr Lehrmann's growing woes.\n\nHe is currently unemployed and confronting up to $5m in legal bills.\n\nHe is also facing a rape charge in Queensland for an alleged incident in Toowoomba in 2021.\n\nHe has yet to be

News.com.au has contacted Mr Lehrmann and Lady Meakes for comment.\n\nNews.com.au understands that Lady Meakes was so distressed at the $2000 rental becoming tabloid fodder that she complained to Channel 7.\n\nBut when she contacted billionaire Kerry Stokes' corporate fixer and media executive Bruce McWilliam to complain, he had to tell her that Mr Lehrmann was her tenant and her problem.\n\nChannel 7's Finance Department was paying the rent, with court documents suggesting the Spotlight program paid as much as $100,000 for the accused rapist to live there.\n\nBut Mr Lehrmann's name is believed to be on the $2000 a week rental agreement, regardless of the fact that it was Mr Stokes' Seven Network that was paying the cash.\n\nThe Australian newspaper reported on Tuesday that Mr Lehrmann moved out of the Balgowlah property on Sydney's northern beaches three weeks early.\n\nBut it's not clear what the complaint relates to although there is some suggestion that he may have terminated the lease early as a result of a procession of paparazzi photographers that turned up to document the comings and goings at the property, including a mysterious blonde spotted vaping on the balcony.\n\nThen, there was the dinner party where it was reported that another man, not Mr Lehrmann, was snorting white powder in a video uploaded to Instagram.\n\nAnother astonishing photo then emerged inside the house where Mr Lehrmann appears to snort a white substance off his dinner table.\n\nHowever, Mr Lehrmann revealed the image was taken as a joke and actually clearly shows him pretending to snort plain flour.\n\nMr Lehrmann then supplied another photo himself to prove it was a joke.\n\n\"Very clearly this is a joke at the last few days of amateur reporting,\" he said.\n\n\"This has been an inappropriate invasion of my private life and a violation of my privacy.\n\n\"Any direct or indirect insinuation that something nefarious was happening is grossly defamatory.\"\n\nThe former Liberal staffer moved out of his Balgowlah home on April 5.\n\nMr Lehrmann was spotted on the move with his friend Rob Porter on that day as former Spotlight producer Taylor Auerbach continued his evidence in the Federal Court.\n\nIt's the first time he had been seen since last surfacing in Sydney after dark on Easter Monday ahead of Ten's sensational bid to reopen the trial.\n\nDressed in a polo shirt and sandals, Mr Lehrmann was again joined by two mates including sailor Rob Porter.\n\nChannel 7 has previously confirmed it would stop paying Mr Lehrmann's rent on Friday after the former Liberal staffer enjoyed one final rent-free weekend with a barefoot blonde spotted vaping on his balcony on Easter Sunday.\n\nChannel 7 sources have confirmed to news.com.au that \"Bruce's accommodation arrangements beyond April 5 have nothing to do with us.\"\n\nMr Lehrmann then drove to his new digs in Sydney where he was photographed carrying a box that says \"a little box of joy.\"\n\nA grimacing Mr Lehrmann was wearing a baseball cap and chinos as he lugged his worldly possessions into his new digs.\n\nHis possessions included a treasured set of golf clubs. Mr Lehrmann, as evidence in the Federal Court was adduced, is a keen golfer.\n\nHis friend, Rob Porter, was clutching a recyclable shopping bag and the obligatory moving day paraphernalia of a checked zip up plastic bag.\n\nMr Lehrmann now has until May 31 to file any notice of appeal against Justice Michael Lee's decision to find that he raped Brittany Higgins, based on the probabilities, in the civil suit he brought against Lisa Wilkinson and Channel Ten.", "source": {"uri": "news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "News.com.au"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samantha_maiden@news.com.au", "name":

"Millions of dollars on the line for Bruce Lehrmann", "body": "Bruce Lehrmann will on Friday afternoon learn whether he will be held liable for millions of dollars in Network 10 and Lisa Wilkinson's legal fees following his failed defamation lawsuit.\n\nHowever, whether he will be able to cover any costs order remains to be seen.\n\nMr Lehrmann was last month dealt a devastating blow when Justice Michael Lee ruled in favour of the broadcaster and high-profile journalist following their blockbuster trial.\n\nThe former Liberal staffer sued over Ms Wilkinson's The Project interview with Brittany Higgins on February 15, 2021 in which she alleged she had been raped by a colleague inside Parliament House after a night out drinking.\n\nJustice Lee upheld Ten and Ms Wilkinson's truth defence, finding it more likely than not that Mr Lehrmann was \"hell-bent on having sex\" with Ms Higgins and that \"he did not care one way or another whether Ms Higgins understood or agreed to what was going on\".\n\nThe matter will return to court on Friday at 2.15pm when Justice Lee will hand down his judgment on the matter of costs.\n\nJustice Lee previously told the court late that there would be a costs order in Ten's favour.\n\nThe combined legal costs of all parties for the trial has been estimated to be $10m.\n\nMr Lehrmann will not have to pay his own lawyers' fees, with the court hearing earlier this week that his agreement with Mark O'Brien Legal was on a no-win, no-fee basis.\n\nThe court also heard earlier this week that Mr Lehrmann did not have any secret financial backers.\n\nHad it been revealed that Mr Lehrmann had a financier, Ten could have applied to make a third party costs order.\n\nJustice Lehrmann, in his judgment handed down on April 15, did find that Ten and Wilkinson's qualified privilege defence failed.\n\nThe defence relates to the reasonableness of the steps taken by the broadcaster in preparing the report.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Lehrmann will have the capacity to pay Ten and Wilkinson's legal bills, which are reportedly millions of dollars.\n\nThe court has heard Mr Lehrmann has not been employed since mid 2021 and he is now a law student.\n\nHe could be forced into bankruptcy if he cannot meet any costs order made against him.\n\nLehrmann has also been granted an extension of time, until the end of the month, to decide whether he will launch an appeal.\n\nLehmann's lawyer David Helvadjian previously told the court that Lehrmann had hired senior counsel and was considering appealing.\n\nOrdinarily parties have 28 days to lodge a notice of appeal -- meaning Lehrmann's deadline to appeal was due to expire on May 13 -- however the court has allowed him until May 31.", "source": {"uri": "news.com.au", "dataType": "news",

That agreement makes no reference to any third party. I have a copy here and I'm happy to produce it to your honour.\n\nLehrmann's barrister, Steven Whybrow SC, acted pro bono for his client in the criminal trial. Whybrow, who was not in court and no longer acts for Lehrmann, commands about $8,000 a day. On some days in court Lehrmann had four barristers, increasing the costs significantly.\n\n\"It was a conditional costs agreement whereby there's no obligation to pay the amount of costs in the event the proceedings were unsuccessful,\" Lee said at the short case management hearing on Wednay.\n\nHe said he planned to deliver his judgment on costs at 2.15pm on Friday.\n\nAt the initial costs hearing on 1 May Lee reserved his decision, and granted Lehrmann an extension of time, until 31 May, to consider whether to lodge an appeal.\n\nThe court has already found Ten is liable for Wilkinson's legal fees.\n\nThe cost of high profile defamation proceedings are steep. Sue Chrysanthou SC, who acted for the former Project host, commands $8,000 a day. Ten's barrister Dr Matt Collins KC is paid about $12,000 a day.\n\nLee found last month that on the balance of probabilities Lehrmann raped Brittany Higgins on a minister's couch in Parliament House in 2019. Lehrmann has always denied the allegation and pleaded not guilty at the criminal trial of the matter which was aborted due to juror misconduct.\n\nThe court will sit at 2.15pm on Friday for a decision on costs.

Tuesday morning.\n\nThe network and Wilkinson have argued Lehrmann - who has not had a job since February 2021 - should cover the costs of the defamation trial because he lost, worth an estimated $10million.\n\nWilkinson's lawyer Zoe Graus said in court on Tuesday that Lehrman was given a notice to produce documentation, bank statements, trust accounts, or third-party agreements with financiers to cover the costs of the trial.\n\nHowever, his solicitor Paul Svilans told the court on Tuesday his client had nothing to produce because there were no agreements.\n\nBruce Lehrmann lost his blockbuster defamation trial on April 15 (pictured outside court)\n\nLisa Wilkinson is pictured delivering a speech outside court after Lehrmann lost his case\n\nThe only agreement Lehrmann had was with defamation law firm Mark O'Brien Legal, which ran the case for him on a no-win, no-fee basis.\n\nJustice Lee said: 'The two key points are, yes, there's been a lot of costs rendered, but they're not recoverable because Mr Lehrmann ... lost.'\n\nThe matter was adjourned until 11.30 on Tuesday.\n\nLehrmann hasn't had a job since Brittany Higgins went public with her rape allegations against him on an episode of The Project in February 2021.\n\nHe wasn't named in the broadcast but sued over claims he was identifiable to friends and colleagues as Ms Higgins' rapist.\n\nLehrmann lost the case on April 15, when Justice Michael Lee found on a balance of probabilities that he had raped Brittany Higgins in Parliament House in 2019.\n\nDuring a costs hearing last Wednesday, Justice Lee said Lehrmann may be forced into bankruptcy.\n\nLisa Wilkinson and Network Ten argued Lehrmann should pay the costs of the trial (court document pictured)\n\nTen's barrister Matthew Collins KC said the legal arguments were 'academic' because Lehrmann would not be able to cover the bills.\n\nRead More Bruce Lehrmann defamation LIVE: Bruce Lehrmann 'could go bankrupt', costs

should never have been brought, saying the former staffer 'knew' the rape allegations against him were substantially true.\n\n'The proceedings could be seen always to have been commenced on the basis that it was doomed to fail, and that he must have known was doomed to fail,' Dr Collins told the court.\n\nJustice Lee said he had reached 'a level of satisfaction' that there will be a costs order

Network.\n\nThe ex-Liberal staffer lived in a Balgowlah property on Sydney's northern beaches for free in exchange for an exclusive interview with Seven about Brittany Higgins' rape allegations.\n\nMr Lehrmann's rent cost the network $2000 a week, totalling more than $100,000 for the period he lived there.\n\nSince he's moved out, the home's owner, Lady Gaenor Meakes, has filed proceedings in the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal against Mr Lehrmann.\n\nA conciliation date is listed as May 23 and will be held at Civic Tower in Sydney's CBD.\n\nIt remains unclear why Lady Meakes has taken Mr Lehrmann to court.\n\nThe home owner is the wife of esteemed sailor Mark Richards, the captain of Wild Oats XI which is the nine-times line honours winner of the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race.\n\nSeven has been the primary sponsor of Wild Oats XI for many years.\n\nThe Australian reported Mr Lehrmann's name was on the lease of the property, but the home was paid for by Network Seven.\n\nAlongside the luxury pad, former Spotlight producer Taylor Auerbach said Seven also spent $10,315 on massages, almost $1800 on meals and $11,738 on accommodation in Sydney's Randwick for Mr Lehrmann.\n\nSeven denied authorising the alleged payments brought up in Mr Auerbach's affidavits during Mr Lehrmann's failed defamation suit against Lisa Wilkinson and Network Ten.\n\nLady Meakes' case comes as Mr Lehrmann was given more time to consider lodging an appeal against the judgement in his failed defamation case against Network 10 and Lisa Wilkinson.\n\nThe former Liberal staffer's barrister David Helvadjian sought an extension to make a potential notice of appeal in Sydney's Federal Court last week, as the matter resumed for a costs hearing.\n\n\"I am instructed to seek an extension of time to lodge a notice to appeal on the basis that new senior counsel has been briefed to provide advice on prospects,\" Mr Helvadjian told the court.\n\n\"And, as Your Honour knows, the transcript is very long and there's over 1,000 exhibits I think or more so we would seek an extension.\"\n\nLehrmann's extension comes after Justice Michael Lee handed down his damning judgement on April 15 that ex-Liberal staffer raped Ms Higgins on the basis of probabilities.\n\nThe extension granted by Justice Lee means all times for appeal will now be pushed out until May 31, 2024.",

marathon case after agreeing to a \"no win, no fee\" deal with the alleged rapist.\n\nA Federal Court hearing was told on Wednesday that the former Liberal staffer also had no third-party financial backers in his high-stakes suit against Network Ten and journalist Lisa Wilkinson.\n\nLehrmann's defamation claim stemmed from a 2021 interview by Wilkinson with Brittany Higgins about allegations she was raped in Parliament House following a night out in 2019.\n\nJustice Michael Lee ruled in favour of Ten and Wilkinson in April, finding Lehrmann most likely raped Ms Higgins, supporting a truth defence.\n\nTheNightlyGet in front of tomorrow's news for FREE\n\nJournalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.\n\nREAD NOW\n\nAhead of a judgment on Friday over how much of Ten and Wilkinson's legal costs Lehrmann will be forced to pay, lawyers from firm Mark O'Brien Legal produced a statement divulging the 28-year-old's financial arrangements with them.\n\nLehrmann had a conditional costs agreement with the firm, which meant he had no obligation to pay in the event the proceedings were unsuccessful, the court heard.\n\nFirm principal Paul Svilans noted there was also no third party to the agreement.\n\n\"There's been a lot of costs rendered but they're not recoverable because Mr Lehrmann ... lost, and there's no third-party agreement to pay costs,\" Justice Lee summarised.\n\nThe judge is due to deliver his decision on costs on Friday, when the decision will be live-streamed due to the public interest in the case.\n\n\"I would like to make that the last judgment I need to deliver in relation to this matter,\" he said.\n\nJustice Lee stood the case down until later on Wednesday to allow Ten to respond to the fresh information from Lehrmann's lawyers, adding he would excuse Mr Svilans from appearing if he did not wish to do so.\n\n\"I appreciate that you're not being paid for being here,\" he said.\n\nJustice Lee previously indicated Lehrmann would likely be responsible for paying at least some of Ten's legal costs after labelling his conduct throughout the litigation as \"disgraceful\".\n\nIn accordance with an earlier court ruling, Ten will be liable for the cost of Wilkinson retaining her own legal representation, which it can also seek to claim from Lehrmann as a legal expense.\n\nTen and Wilkinson separately retained some of the nation's most highly sought-after lawyers, which could lift Lehrmann's liability for repaying their costs into the millions of dollars.\n\nIn submissions on costs made public last month, Ten's lawyer Matt Collins KC described Lehrmann pursuing the defamation claim as \"deliberately wicked and calculated\".\n\n\"Mr Lehrmann engaged in an abuse of the court's processes, ran a case based on positive falsities and put Network Ten to the cost of defending a baseless proceeding,\" he wrote.\n\nLehrmann's rape trial in the ACT Supreme Court was eventually aborted because of juror misconduct and the case was abandoned by prosecutors over fears for Ms Higgins' mental health.\n\nHe has denied any sexual contact occurred.\n\nGet the latest news

adding he would excuse Mr Svilans from appearing if he did not wish to do so.\n\n\"I appreciate that you're not being paid for being here,\" he said.\n\nJustice Lee previously indicated Lehrmann would likely be responsible for paying at least some of Ten's legal costs after labelling his conduct throughout the litigation as \"disgraceful\".\n\nIn accordance with an earlier court ruling, Ten will be liable for the cost of Wilkinson retaining her own legal representation, which it can also seek to claim from Lehrmann as a legal expense.\n\nTen and Wilkinson separately retained some of the nation's most highly sought-after lawyers, which could lift Lehrmann's liability for repaying their costs into the millions of dollars.\n\nIn submissions on costs made public last month, Ten's lawyer Matt Collins KC described Lehrmann pursuing the defamation claim as \"deliberately wicked and calculated\".\n\n\"Mr Lehrmann engaged in an abuse of the court's processes, ran a case based on positive falsities and put Network Ten to the cost of defending a baseless proceeding,\" he wrote.\n\nLehrmann's rape trial in the ACT Supreme Court was eventually aborted because of juror misconduct and the case was abandoned by prosecutors over fears for Ms Higgins' mental health.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

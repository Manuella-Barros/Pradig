Chinese ships detected in beefed-up presence", "body": "TAIPEI, Taiwan - Taiwanese defense and coast guard officials said on Thursday dozens of Chinese warplanes and ships had been detected around the island, less than two weeks before self-ruled Taiwan's inauguration for a new president.\n\nChina claims Taiwan as part of its territory and has said it will not rule out using force to bring the island under Beijing's control.\n\nThe Chinese military presence around the island announced by Taipei, which included another 23 warplanes and five naval vessels in the 24 hours leading up to 6 am, also came a day after a US warship sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait.\n\nThe Coast Guard in Taipei said late on Thursday it had detected 12 Chinese ships around its outlying island of Kinmen.\n\nKinmen, administered by Taipei but located five kilometers (three miles) from the Chinese city of Xiamen, has seen heightened tensions in recent months, with Chinese coast guard ships maintaining a presence around it.\n\nThe Taiwan Coast Guard said a fleet of seven ships \"belonging to China's maritime and fishery departments entered our restricted waters\" around 3 pm local time (0700 GMT), about 4 nautical miles southwest of Kinmen.\n\n\"We suspected the fleet, together with three Chinese fishing, boats, were engaged in maritime exercises,\" it said.\n\nAround the same time, \"another fleet of four Chinese coast guard ships entered our prohibited and restricted waters... and another ship sailed outside our waters.\"\n\nThe vessels left about 90 minutes later, the coast guard said, noting that this was \"the fourth formation of Chinese coast guard ships sailing in Kinmen waters\" in May.\n\nIt was also the first time that Chinese coast guard ships \"and other Chinese official ships\" had sailed together at the same time, it said.\n\n\"This has seriously undermined cross-strait peace, stability and navigation safety, hurt the feelings of people on both sides of the strait, and is unhelpful for peaceful exchanges across the Taiwan Strait,\" the coast guard said.\n\nChina has stepped up patrols around Kinmen after a series of deadly fishing incidents earlier this year.\n\nA Chinese speedboat carrying four people capsized near Kinmen on February 14 while Taiwan's coast guard was pursuing it, killing two people.\n\nAnother Chinese boat capsized in the area in March, also resulting in the deaths of two crew members.\n\nTaiwan's coast guard had defended its actions but the row has added to tensions, already high after Taiwan's elections in January won by Vice President Lai Ching-te.\n\nLai, like outgoing President Tsai Ing-wen, rejects China's claim on Taiwan.\n\nWarship sail-through\n\nThursday's maritime presence around Kinmen came after Taiwan's defense ministry said it had detected nearly two dozen Chinese warplanes and five navy ships around the island in the 24 hours leading up to 6 am Thursday (2200 GMT).\n\nThat coincided with a US warship sailing through the Taiwan Strait, a narrow 180-kilometer (110-mile) body of water separating the island from China, on Wednesday.\n\nThe USS Halsey destroyer \"conducted a routine Taiwan Strait transit on May 8 through waters where high-seas freedoms of navigation and overflight apply in accordance with international law\", the US 7th fleet said.\n\nIt said the Halsey's transit \"demonstrates the United States' commitment to upholding freedom of navigation for all nations as a principle\".\n\nChinese naval colonel Li Xi, spokesman for the Eastern Theatre Command, called the US warship sail-through \"public hype\".\n\nHe added in a statement late on Wednesday that the Eastern Theatre command had also organized naval and air forces \"to monitor the passage of the US ship through the entire process\".\n\n\"Troops in the theatre remain on high alert at all times and resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and security,\" the statement said.\n\nChina had warned before Taiwan's elections that Lai would bring \"war and decline\" to the island, making the lead-up to his May 20 inauguration a closely watched period. -- Agence France-Presse", "source": {"uri":

fishing, boats, were engaged in maritime exercises,\" it said.\n\nAround the same time, \"another fleet of four Chinese coast guard ships entered our prohibited and restricted waters... and another ship sailed outside our waters.\"\n\nThe vessels left about 90 minutes later, the coast guard said, noting that this was \"the fourth formation of Chinese coast guard ships sailing in Kinmen waters\" in May.\n\nIt was also the first time that Chinese coast guard ships \"and other Chinese official ships\" had sailed together at the same time, it said.\n\n\"This has seriously undermined cross-strait peace, stability and navigation safety, hurt the feelings of people on both sides of the strait, and is unhelpful for peaceful exchanges across the Taiwan Strait,\" the coast guard said.\n\nChina has stepped up patrols around Kinmen after a series of deadly fishing incidents earlier this year.\n\nA Chinese speedboat carrying four people capsized near Kinmen on February 14 while Taiwan's coast guard was pursuing it, killing two people.\n\nAnother Chinese boat capsized in the area in March, also resulting in the deaths of two crew members.\n\nTaiwan's coast guard had defended its actions but the row has added to tensions, already high after Taiwan's elections in January won by Vice President Lai Ching-te.\n\nLai, like outgoing President Tsai Ing-wen, rejects China's claim on Taiwan.\n\nThursday's maritime presence around Kinmen came after Taiwan's defence ministry said it had detected nearly two dozen Chinese warplanes and five navy ships around the island in the 24 hours leading up to 6 am Thursday (2200 GMT).\n\nThat coincided with a US warship sailing through the Taiwan Strait, a narrow 180-kilometre (110-mile) body of water separating the island from China, on Wednesday.\n\nThe USS Halsey destroyer \"conducted a routine Taiwan Strait transit on May 8 through waters where high-seas freedoms of navigation and overflight apply in accordance with international law\", the US 7th fleet said.\n\nIt said the Halsey's transit \"demonstrates the United States' commitment to upholding freedom of navigation for all nations as a principle\".\n\nChinese naval colonel Li Xi, spokesman for the Eastern Theatre Command, called the US warship sail-through \"public hype\".\n\nHe added in a statement late on Wednesday that the Eastern Theatre command had also organised naval and air forces \"to monitor the passage of the US ship through the entire process\".\n\n\"Troops in the theatre remain on high alert at all times and resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and security,\" the statement said.\n\nChina had warned before Taiwan's elections that Lai would bring \"war and decline\" to the island, making the lead-up to his May 20 inauguration a closely watched period.", "source": {"uri": "spacewar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SpaceWar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Strait", "type": "wiki", "score":

The Chinese government has ramped up coast guard patrols around the islands since Tokyo nationalized them in 2012.\n\nChina's coast guard, which has no publicly available contact information, could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe maritime law enforcement agency, which was merged into a unified command only a decade ago, has spearheaded Beijing's assertion of territorial rights in neighboring waters, including in the Taiwan Strait and in the South China Sea.\n\nIn the East China Sea, China has sent coast guard vessels into Japan's claimed contiguous zone around the Senkaku islets every day since December 22, a run of 139 days up to May 8, according to Newsweek's analysis of the Japan coast guard database.\n\nPreviously, a brief pause in activity in mid-December ended a streak of Chinese vessel sightings at the Senkakus lasting a record 339 consecutive days.\n\nIn April, Japan reported 118 Chinese coast guard vessels in its claimed maritime zones in the island group, including 13 inside its territorial sea.\n\nThe United States officially does not take a position on sovereignty over the islets, but it recognizes Japan's administration of the territory, and is treaty-bound to defend Japanese forces should they come under attack there.\n\nPresident Joe Biden reaffirmed the U.S. security commitment last month when he hosted Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at the White House.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Newsweek shortly thereafter, Kishida said China's \"untransparent\" military buildup and its \"unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force\" were a serious cause for concern.\n\n\"I think we are facing the most challenging and complex security environment since the end of World War II,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType":

Television footage showed rescue workers making their way through mud and uprooted trees to reach those who had been stranded. Vehicles swept off the roads were seen stuck in a swollen river.

(AP Photo/ R S Iyer)NEW DELHI (AP) - Multiple landslides in southern India have killed 93 people and many others are feared trapped under the debris, officials said Tuesday, after torrential rains triggered torrents of mud and water that swept through tea estates and villages. The landslides hit hilly areas in Kerala state's Wayanad district early Tuesday, flattening houses, uprooting trees and destroying bridges. Rescuers were working to pull out people stuck under mud and debris, but their efforts were hampered by blocked roads and unstable terrain. Authorities have yet to determine the full scope of the disaster. Kerala's chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, said the landslides had killed at least 93 people and more than 100 people were receiving treatment for injures. He said more than 3,000 people have been moved to relief camps. Vijayan did not specify how many people were missing or trapped under the debris. Local media reported that most of the victims were tea estate workers. Television footage showed rescue workers making their way through mud and uprooted trees to reach those who had been stranded. Vehicles swept off the roads were seen stuck in a swollen river. Local TV news channels also aired phone calls of stranded people asking for help. Authorities mobilized helicopters to help with rescue efforts and the Indian army was roped in to build a temporary bridge. \"We are trying every way to rescue our people,\"\u009d state Health Minister Veena George said. In a post on social media platform X, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was \"distressed by the landslides in parts of Wayanad,\" a hilly district which is part of the Western Ghats mountain range. \"My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones and prayers with those injured,\"\u009d Modi wrote. He announced compensation of 200,000 rupees ($2,388) to the victims' families. India's weather department has put Kerala on alert as the state has been lashed by incessant rains. Downpours have disrupted life for many, and authorities closed schools in some parts Tuesday. More rains are predicted through the day. Kerala, one of India's most popular tourist destinations, is prone to heavy rains, flooding and landslides. Nearly 500 people were killed in the state in 2018 in one of the worst floods. The Indian Meteorological Department said the state has had heavy rainfall over its northern and central regions, with Wayanad district recording up to 28 centimeters (11 inches) of rain in the past 24 hours. \"Monsoon patterns are increasingly erratic and the quantum of rainfall that we receive in a short spell of time has increased. As a result, we see frequent instances of landslides and floods along the Western Ghats,\"\u009d said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. Koll also said authorities must check on rapid construction activities happening over landslide areas. \"Often landslides and flash floods occur over regions where the impact of both climate change and direct human intervention in terms of land use changes are evident,\"\u009d he said. A 2013 report by a federal government-appointed committee said that 37% of the total area of the Western Ghats mountains should be declared an ecosensitive area and proposed restrictions on any form of construction. The report's recommendations have not been implemented so far because state governments and residents opposed it.

The landslides hit hilly villages in Kerala state's Wayanad district early Tuesday and destroyed many houses and a bridge, but authorities have yet to determine the full scope of the disaster. Rescuers were working to pull out people stuck under mud and debris, but their efforts were hampered due to blocked roads and unstable terrain.

Television visuals showed rescue workers making their way through mud and uprooted trees to reach to those who have been stranded. Vehicles swept off the roads were seen stuck in a swollen river. Authorities mobilized helicopters to help with rescue efforts and Indian army was roped in to build a temporary bridge after landslides destroyed a main bridge that linked the affected area. \"We are trying every way to rescue our people,\"\u009d state Health Minister Veena George said.

Koll also said authorities must check on rapid construction activities happening over landslide areas. \"Often landslides and flashfloods occur over regions where the impact of both climate change and direct human intervention in terms of land use changes are evident,\"\u009d he said. A 2013 report by a federal government-appointed committee said that 37% of the total area of the Western Ghats mountains should be declared as an ecosensitive area and proposed restrictions on any form of construction. The report's recommendations have not been implemented so far because state governments and residents opposed it. India regularly has severe floods during the monsoon season, which runs between June and September and brings most of South Asia's annual rainfall. The rains are crucial for rain-fed crops planted during the season, but often cause extensive damage. Scientists say monsoons are becoming more erratic because of climate change and global warming. ___ AP writer Sibi Arasu in Bengaluru, India, contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@medicinehatnews.com", "name": "Canadian Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landslide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayanad_district", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wayanad district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wayanad district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kochi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kochi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veena_George", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Veena George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_and_Family_Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Health and Family Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Ghats", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Ghats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Tropical_Meteorology", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Meteorological_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India Meteorological Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monsoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Advaita_Vedanta", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Advaita Vedanta", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://medicinehatnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cp/2024073000070-66a866090c1d3f737cc87d0ajpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774493", "eventUri": "eng-9774493", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

However, the gushing soil, gravel and rock reached the town of Chooralmala, 6km (3.7 miles) away.\n\n\"The landslides happened at the top and then affected the lower valley areas where people were staying. Focus right now is to search the entire uphill area for stranded people and recover as many bodies [as possible],\" MR Ajith Kumar, a state law and order official, told the Reuters news agency.\n\nMore than a dozen bodies were found overnight, said police officer Aijaz, who uses one name, as over 300 rescuers worked to pull out people stuck under mud and debris, but their efforts were hampered by extremely heavy rainfall, blocked roads and unstable terrain.\n\nNearly 350 of the 400 registered houses in the affected region have been damaged, Kerala's Asianet TV channel reported, citing district officials.\n\nThe first landslide occurred at 2am on Tuesday (20:30 GMT on Monday), followed by another two hours later.\n\nLocal media reported that most of the victims were tea estate workers. Television footage showed rescue workers making their way through mud and uprooted trees to reach those who had been stranded.\n\nVehicles swept off the roads were seen stuck in a swollen river. Local TV news channels also aired phone calls of stranded people asking for help.\n\nAfter a day of hampered rescue operations, the weather department expects some respite on Wednesday, although the area is likely to receive rain through the day.\n\nAt least 572mm (22.5 inches) of rain fell in the two days leading up to the landslide, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in a statement.\n\nSeveral areas, including Meppadi, Mundakkai and Chooralmala, were isolated, and roads were washed away causing immense damage to homes, said Vijayan in a statement released by his office.\n\n\"Efforts to locate missing persons continue with all available resources,\" the statement said, adding that more than 3,000 people have been moved to relief camps and the government is ensuring the delivery of food and essential items there.\n\nIn a post on social media platform X on Tuesday night, Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, who until recently represented Wayanad in Parliament, said he had been unable to visit the disaster area.\n\n\"Due to incessant rains and adverse weather conditions we have been informed by authorities that we will not be able to land,\" he said. \"Our thoughts are with the people of Wayanad at this difficult time.\"\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said he was \"distressed by the landslides\" and announced a compensation of 200,000 rupees ($2,388) to the victims' families.\n\nMonsoon rains across South Asia from June to September offer respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. They are vital for agriculture and therefore the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security for the region's two billion people.\n\nBut they also bring destruction in the form of landslides and floods. The number of fatal floods and landslides has increased in recent years, and experts say climate change is exacerbating the problem.\n\n\"Events like landslides, they are part of these climate change-triggered heavy rainfall disasters,\" Kartiki Negi of Indian environment think tank Climate Trends told the AFP news agency.\n\n\"India will continue to see more and more of these kinds of impacts in the future,\" she added.\n\nDamming, deforestation and development projects in India have also exacerbated the human toll.\n\nIntense monsoon storms battered India this month, flooding parts of the financial capital Mumbai, while lightning in the eastern state of Bihar killed at least 10 people.\n\nNearly 500 people were killed around Kerala in 2018 during the worst flooding to hit the state in almost a century.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide",

However, the gushing soil, gravel and rock reached the town of Chooralmala, 6km (3.7 miles) away.\n\n\"The landslides happened at the top and then affected the lower valley areas where people were staying. Focus right now is to search the entire uphill area for stranded people and recover as many bodies [as possible],\" MR Ajith Kumar, a state law and order official, told the Reuters news agency.\n\nMore than a dozen bodies were found overnight, said police officer Aijaz, who uses one name, as over 300 rescuers worked to pull out people stuck under mud and debris, but their efforts were hampered by extremely heavy rainfall, blocked roads and unstable terrain.\n\nNearly 350 of the 400 registered houses in the affected region have been damaged, Kerala's Asianet TV channel reported, citing district officials.\n\nThe first landslide occurred at 2am on Tuesday (20:30 GMT on Monday), followed by another two hours later.\n\nLocal media reported that most of the victims were tea estate workers. Television footage showed rescue workers making their way through mud and uprooted trees to reach those who had been stranded.\n\nVehicles swept off the roads were seen stuck in a swollen river. Local TV news channels also aired phone calls of stranded people asking for help.\n\nAfter a day of hampered rescue operations, the weather department expects some respite on Wednesday, although the area is likely to receive rain through the day.\n\nAt least 572mm (22.5 inches) of rain fell in the two days leading up to the landslide, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in a statement.\n\nSeveral areas, including Meppadi, Mundakkai and Chooralmala, were isolated, and roads were washed away causing immense damage to homes, said Vijayan in a statement released by his office.\n\n\"Efforts to locate missing persons continue with all available resources,\" the statement said, adding that more than 3,000 people have been moved to relief camps and the government is ensuring the delivery of food and essential items there.\n\nIn a post on social media platform X on Tuesday night, Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, who until recently represented Wayanad in Parliament, said he had been unable to visit the disaster area.\n\n\"Due to incessant rains and adverse weather conditions we have been informed by authorities that we will not be able to land,\" he said. \"Our thoughts are with the people of Wayanad at this difficult time.\"\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said he was \"distressed by the landslides\" and announced a compensation of 200,000 rupees ($2,388) to the victims' families.\n\nMonsoon rains across South Asia from June to September offer respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. They are vital for agriculture and therefore the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security for the region's two billion people.\n\nBut they also bring destruction in the form of landslides and floods. The number of fatal floods and landslides has increased in recent years, and experts say climate change is exacerbating the problem.\n\n\"Events like landslides, they are part of these climate change-triggered heavy rainfall disasters,\" Kartiki Negi of Indian environment think tank Climate Trends told the AFP news agency.\n\n\"India will continue to see more and more of these kinds of impacts in the future,\" she added.\n\nDamming, deforestation and development projects in India have also exacerbated the human toll.\n\nIntense monsoon storms battered India this month, flooding parts of the financial capital Mumbai, while lightning in the eastern state of Bihar killed at least 10 people.\n\nNearly 500 people were killed around Kerala in 2018 during the worst flooding to hit the state in almost a century.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide", "type": "wiki",

Helicopters will also be brought in, but the weather is bad,\" she told news agency ANI.\n\nThe scale of the disaster is yet to be fully ascertained, with authorities confirming at least 93 deaths by Tuesday afternoon 4.30pm local time (noon GMT). The local Asianet TV channel put the unofficial toll at 107. Around 116 people were hospitalised with injuries.\n\nVideos from the scene showed relief workers navigating through debris and uprooted trees, while muddy water flowed through the remains of destroyed homes.\n\nAuthorities mobilised helicopters to help with rescue efforts and the Indian Army was called in to build a temporary bridge after landslides destroyed one that linked the affected area.\n\nMore showers were expected in Kerala throughout Tuesday with authorities shutting schools in parts of the state.\n\nThe Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said Kerala, a state prone to landslides, has had heavy rainfall over its northern and central regions, with Wayanad recording up to 28cm (11 inches) of rain in the last 24 hours.\n\nPrime minister Narendra Modi offered condolences and announced financial aid of \u00a31,900 for the families of the deceased and \u00a3475 for those injured.\n\n\"Rescue operations are currently underway to assist all those affected. Spoke to Kerala CM Shri @pinarayivijayan and assured all possible help from the Centre,\" he posted on X.\n\nRahul Gandhi, the leader of opposition and former MP from Wayanad, urged the Modi government in parliament to increase compensation for the victims and spoke about \"an alarming rise in landslides\".\n\n\"Our country has witnessed an alarming rise in landslides in the last few years,\" Mr Gandhi told parliament.\n\n\"There is an urgent need for mapping of landslide-prone areas and to take up mitigation measures and an action plan to address the growing frequency of natural calamities in the ecologically fragile region,\" he said.\n\nThe hill state of Himachal Pradesh has also recorded landslides in recent weeks while many regions in north have been flooded.\n\nScientific assessments show that the climate crisis, fuelled by burning coal, oil and gas, is making rainfall more erratic, with higher amount of rain falling in a short period. The last 13 months have been the hottest on record for the planet with Sunday recorded as the hottest day ever.\n\nMeanwhile, human activities like construction in eco-sensitive regions, is making many hilly areas prone to landslides.\n\n\"Monsoon patterns are increasingly erratic and the quantum of rainfall that we receive in a short spell of time has increased. As a result, we see frequent instances of landslides and floods along the Western Ghats,\" Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, told The Associated Press.\n\nMr Koll also said authorities must check on rapid construction activities happening over landslide areas.\n\n\"Often landslides and flash floods occur over regions where the impact of both climate change and direct human intervention in terms of land use changes are evident,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

Several tea and cardamom plantations were also devastated.\n\nHundreds of workers took part in the rescue operation on Wednesday, pulling bodies from the mud and debris, but it was hampered by adverse weather conditions and access difficulties after key roads and bridges were washed away in the disaster. At the end of the second day of rescue efforts, about 190 people were still missing or unidentified, children among them, and fears were fading for their survival.\n\nThe Indian army evacuated more than 5,500 people from the area, including hundreds of stranded tourists, and took them to dozens of relief camps as the heavy rains continued.\n\nA political row broke out over the disaster after India's home minister, Amit Shah, said warnings had been given to the Kerala state government - ruled by an opposition party - about the potential threat of landslides in the region due to heavy monsoon rains.\n\n\"Teams were sent in Kerala in advance.

Reuters\n\nLandslides in Kerala's Wayanad district have killed over 60 people and injured dozens of others. The disaster triggered by torrential rains struck the hilly areas near Meppadi in Wayanad on Tuesday morning (July 30).\n\nSeveral landslides were reported in Mundakkai and Chooralmala villages under Meppadi Panchayat. Multiple bodies were recovered from the Chaliyar River in Malappuram's Nilambur region, while many others are feared to have washed away, reported Indian Express.\n\nRescue efforts were obstructed after the main bridge leading to Mundakkai village collapsed. The Indian Army and Navy teams, along with the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), are being deployed to assist in rescue operations.\n\nAlmost every year Kerala witnesses deadly landslides in the monsoon season. But why does this happen? We explain.\n\nRecent floods, landslides in Kerala\n\nKerala reported devastating floods in 2018 - the worst in its history - that killed 483 people. In just three days in August of that year, the southern state received a third of its average annual rainfall.\n\nAs many as 295 people died due to landslides in Kerala between 1961 and 2016, Dr S Sreekumar, disaster risk consultant, told The Week in 2022. \"There is a massive increase in death and damage rate as well as instances of landslides since 2018,\" he said.\n\nSimilar tragedies were reported in the monsoon of 2019 and 2020 that claimed over 100 lives.\n\nIn 2021, dozens of people died due to multiple landslides and floods in the districts of Kottayam and Idukki in Kerala.\n\nSeveral people died in the state due to rain-related incidents such as landslips and flash floods in 2022.\n\nThe Climate Report of India released by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) last January found that extreme weather events claimed 32 lives in Kerala in 2022. While 30 died due to flooding and heavy rainfall, two others were killed in thunderstorms and lightning, reported Times of India.\n\nIn July 2022, the Ministry of Earth Sciences told the Lok Sabha that Kerala witnessed the most number of major landslides in the country in the past seven years. Of the 3,782 landslides between 2015 and 2022, about 59.2 per cent, or 2,239, were reported in God's Own Country.\n\nLandslides in Kerala\n\nKerala is prone to heavy rains and flooding, with an estimated 14.5 per cent of land area seen as vulnerable.\n\nAccording to experts, 13 districts in Kerala are susceptible to landslides except the coastal district of Alappuzha, as per The Week report.\n\nThe Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) has identified 1,848 square kilometres, 4.75 per cent of the state's total area, as High Landslide Hazard Zone.\n\nAbout 8 per cent of the area in the Western Ghats in the southern state is labelled as a critical zone for mass movements, including debris flow, landslides, rock falls and slumps, reported The Week.\n\nA recent AI-aided study revealed that about 13 per cent of Kerala is extremely prone to landslides, with Idukki, Palakkad, Malappuram, Pathanamthitta and Wayanad categorised as highly vulnerable regions.\n\nThe research by Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences (Kufos) found a 3.46 per cent increase in the extreme landslide susceptibility zone in the southern state after the 2018 \"extreme rainfall event\", reported The New Indian Express (TNIE).\n\nIn 2011, the Western Ghats Ecology Experts Panel (WGEEP), chaired by ecologist Madhav Gadgil, had classified most of the Idukki and Wayanad districts as category 1 under eco-sensitive zones, meaning they were highly vulnerable and forest land in these areas should not to be used for agriculture or non-forest activities. However, two years later, the Kasturirangan report had toned down the recommendations, reported Scroll.\n\nALSO READ: Wayanad landslides kill over 50: Why do landslips occur more frequently during the rains?\n\nReasons for landslides\n\nClimate change, deforestation are some factors blamed for Kerala's frequent landslides in the rainy season.\n\nThe changing rainfall pattern in Kerala over the last few years has contributed to the issue. The state has seen a delay in the monsoon rains. TV Sajeev, a scientist at the Kerala Forest Research Institute, told Scroll in 2020, \"When I was in school, the day school used to reopen was the day the rains arrived - June 1. Now, it has been pushed to the first or second week of June. Then you have intermittent rains, not continuous. At the end of July until mid-August, there is high intensity rainfall.\"\n\nSpeaking to Frontline magazine, S Abhilash, Research Director at Advanced Centre for Atmospheric Radar Research in Cochin University of Science and Technology, said, \"There is not much variation in the total rainfall data over the season, but rainfall is concentrated over a fewer number of days. Spells of heavy rain, which lead to calamities like floods and landslides, are a result of climate change induced by global warming.\"\n\nPost disaster investigations have found unprecedented heavy rains were responsible for landslides.\n\nConstruction activities in vulnerable areas also lead to disasters. \"A lot of construction activities are happening in our state [Kerala] in vulnerable areas. We built more roads and culverts. However, even now our engineering structures are being built based on the amount of rainfall and intensity of rainfall in older days. There is a need to rethink new or added risk factors while constructing roads or culverts. We are not providing room for the river in many places and this is an important factor for flash floods. Our unscientific construction mechanisms are major causes for the destruction we are facing,\" Sreekumar told The Week.\n\nAccording to Girish Gopinath, head of the Kufos Department of climate variability and aquatic ecosystems, \"Human activities in the periphery of Wayand and Idukki high ranges are a major factor contributing to landslides,\" TNIE reported.\n\nAs BOOM noted, landslides are caused by the additive impact of water on topography, geology, soil and vegetation. G Sankar, a former scientist with the National Centre for Earth Science Studies (NCESS), explained that the Western Ghats in Kerala are marked by thick soil cover but human interventions over the years have affected them.\n\n\"During monsoon, the overburden soil gets saturated due to percolating rainwater, making it unstable. When the water content reaches a threshold level, the soil mass becomes weak triggering debris flows,\" he told BOOM in 2021.\n\n\"There are small drainage channels present on the surface of the hilly areas. Erecting buildings and contour bunds block their natural flow. During the rains, the water that percolates get concentrated leading to increased pore pressure along the channel,\" Sankar said.\n\n\"All mountain drainage channels should be free helping easy runoff. We should not construct buildings on or near these channels or at least give leverage of 50m on both sides,\" he added.\n\nIt is the marginalised who are bearing the brunt of the natural calamities.\n\nThe landslides and floods in Kerala affect historically marginalised and vulnerable groups, such as women, the elderly, children, persons with disabilities, Scheduled Tribes, Scheduled Castes and fisherfolk, the most, according to The Rebuild Kerala Development Programme paper.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

However, the same hilly terrain and dense forests that contribute to its beauty also make it highly susceptible to during the monsoon season. Heavy rains often lead to soil erosion and landslides, particularly in areas like Meppadi, Vythiri, and their surrounding regions.\n\nIn the early hours of July 30, tragedy struck 's Wayanad district. Massive landslides, triggered by relentless monsoon rains, buried large areas under debris, killing around 70 people and leaving many more injured. The death toll is expected to rise as rescue operations continue and more people are reported missing.\n\nPicturesque hamlets like Mundakkai, Chooralmala, Attamala, and Noolpuzha, known for their natural beauty, now lie in ruins, cut off from the rest of the district. Vehicles have been washed away by floodwaters, getting stuck in tree trunks or submerged in many places. Huge boulders have rolled down the hills, obstructing rescue efforts. Despite the heavy rains, rescue workers continue to shift the injured and deceased into ambulances.\n\nThe Kerala State Disaster Management Authority quickly mobilised National Disaster Response Force () teams to the affected areas. The Indian Army and two Air Force helicopters, a Mi-17 and an Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH), were also deployed for rescue operations.\n\nMeanwhile, experts attribute these landslides to heavy rainfall, geologically weak soil, deforestation, and careless construction practices.\n\nA landslide is the movement of rock, earth, or debris down a slope. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), landslides are a type of \"mass wasting,\" which includes any down-slope movement of soil and rock under the influence of gravity. Common types of landslides include debris flows (mudflows or mudslides) and rock falls.\n\nThe National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) explains landslides using an illustration, highlighting that they can be triggered by geological, morphological, and human factors. Geological factors refer to the characteristics of the earth or rock, while morphological factors pertain to the structure of the land, such as slopes losing vegetation. Human activities like deforestation, construction, and agriculture can increase the risk of landslides by destabilising slopes.\n\nOne primary reason for the increase in landslides during the monsoon is concentrated rainfall due to climate change. Heavy rains, combined with unplanned structural interventions in fragile landscapes, often lead to landslides. Deforestation for infrastructure projects weakens the soil, making it more vulnerable to waterlogging and subsequent landslides.\n\nKerala has witnessed a rise in deadly landslides during the monsoon. An IIT Delhi study noted that heavy rain destroys steep slopes with loose soil, causing landslides. The state recorded the highest number of major landslides in India in recent years. Of the 3,782 landslides between 2015 and 2022 so far, 2,239 alone were reported in Kerala, sources suggest.\n\nAs Kerala deals with the aftermath of this disaster, it has become crucial to address the underlying causes of landslides and implement measures to mitigate their impact. Sustainable development, reforestation, and careful planning of infrastructure projects can help reduce the risk of such tragedies in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, while Wayanad's natural beauty is enhanced by the monsoon, the increased rainfall also brings potential hazards.

The numbers are only going to spiral, as villages have been swept away and disaster rescue teams are finding it difficult to reach submerged areas. Effort is on to save as many lives as they can, but the wrath of family members is justifiable. They want to know, and rightly so, as to why if Kerala falls under the cross section of being in the critical zone for mass land movements and also for bearing the burden of heavy rains, no planning has gone into proper disaster management in the state.\n\nThere is enough data that substantiates the gnawing issue of Kerala and it's toxic relationship with landslides. Of the 3,782 major landslides in India between 2015 and 2022, almost 59.2 per cent or 2,239 landslides were reported in Kerala alone. The number of such events and the tragic loss to life and property today can be gauged hence.\n\nThere is another number that begs attention. According to Dr S Sreekumar, the disaster risk consultant at Kerala Institute of Local Administration, 295 landslide-related causalities were reported in Kerala between 1961 and 2016. He also added that there has been a massive increase in death and damage rate as well as instances of landslides since 2018.\n\nMore numbers, more damage, ZERO action\n\nExcept the coastal district of Alappuzha, the other 13 are prone to landslides, according to a report submitted by the Disaster Management agency of the state in 2024. Here are some other landslides that come to memory\n\nThese numbers go on to show how flash floods and massive rains have made the soil in Kerala more susceptible to landslides.\n\nFaulty construction in vulnerable areas\n\nOne with know-how on environmental factors, would immediately link flash floods to be an important reason for landslides. However, there are other major causative factors too. Like in other areas, a lot of deep deforestation has taken place along the Western Ghats and construction activities are happening in the most vulnerable of areas.\n\nAccording to a disaster management expert, Dr Mathew Thomas, even our engineering structures don't abide by modern environmental guidelines. \"We have built more roads and culverts but our engineering structures are built based on the amount of rainfall and intensity of rainfall during the older days. There is an urgent need to rethink this strategy. We have to invent new ways or follow added risk factors while constructing roads or culverts these days,\" he said.\n\nThe other possible reasons for the increase in landslides, especially in the last decade is that our engineers are not providing room for the river in many places. \"This is a crucial factor for flash floods happening in the state,\" Thomas adds.\n\nIt is true that unscientific construction mechanism is becoming a major cause for the destruction due to landslides that Kerala has been facing with.\n\nIs there a way forward?\n\nThe state has been working overtime to mitigate landslides and other possible natural disasters. In 2018, for example, the state disaster management authority had released the landslide and flood susceptibility maps of Kerala in Geoinformation file formats on its website for public use.\n\nHowever, this knowledge and technology did not end up reaching the local self-governments and not even to the general public. People don't have the knowledge to use these maps that have been made by experts. Nor is there any effort made to help them understand how to use it when a disaster happens because such plans will have the high-hazardous areas and the flood-prone zones marked.\n\nNeither are the maps user-friendly, nor is there a provision for a resource group at the local level which could help to interpret the knowledge from these maps to the people.\n\nApart from a well thought out plan to attenuate any disaster that may happen due to a landslide, there should be caution maintained in overseeing construction projects as well. The need is not to lessen the impact once the mishap has happened but to arrest the problem at the root. There are small things that can go a long way in arresting landslides and flash floods in the area. For example, before building a dam or a rainwater pit in a hilly region, there should be a more scientific analysis. These areas are generally not fit for building a rainwater pit. We need to build architectural and engineering awareness at the district level so that our project is not inviting new disasters,.\" said Thomas.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "deebashree_mohanty@news9live.com", "name": "Deebashree Mohanty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landslide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toxicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flash flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culvert", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Culvert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Ghats", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Ghats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deforestation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alappuzha_district", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alappuzha district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alappuzha district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scientific method"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rain"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Consulting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Disaster_Relief_and_Recovery", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Disaster Relief and Recovery", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Wayanad.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774493", "eventUri": "eng-9774493", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 139, "textEnd": 146}], "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

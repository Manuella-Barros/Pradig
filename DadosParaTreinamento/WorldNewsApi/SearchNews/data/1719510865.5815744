Abdullah had sued the LAPD in 2020 after officers responded to her home in an alleged \"swatting\" incident. Swatting is the practice of calling in fake police emergencies to a person's residence, sometimes resulting in violence. Abdullah argued that police had known the swatting call was a hoax, but responded to her home anyway in an attempt to intimidate her due to her anti-police advocacy. Police argued they acted appropriately, saying a caller had claimed he had taken three hostages inside Abdullah's home. He threatened to kill the imagined hostages if he did not receive a payment of $1 million. CORNEL WEST DITCHES GREEN PARTY; NOW RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AS AN INDEPENDENT Abdullah livestreamed from her phone during the police interaction, and she could be heard asking officers, \"Do you know who I am?\" She also asked her viewers on social media to contact two members of the LA city council, according to the Times. Abdullah said the Thursday ruling against her was \"dispiriting and disappointing and not surprising,\" arguing it was the result of \"an unjust system,\" the Times reported. She plans to appeal the ruling. Abdullah last made headlines when she was selected as Cornel West's running mate in the 2024 presidential election. She accepted West's offer in early April.

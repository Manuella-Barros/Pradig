{"id": 239775946, "title": "How magazine, whose Arabic root word means storehouse, came to denote a periodical", "text": "A Sunday pleasure for many of you, dear readers, surely involves a leisurely perusal of this magazine \u2013 turning the pages of the physical copy at your breakfast table, or, still in bed, scrolling through online. If your household happens to include a teen boy, their weekend may be magazine-strewn, too \u2013 feeding ammo into their firearms in online shooting games. The origins of \u201cmagazine\u201d at first glance appear quite different from either of those definitions \u2013 tracing to the Arabic, makhzan \u201cstorehouse, granary\u201d, with plural makh\u0101zin, from the root khazana \u201cto store up\u201d. The language contact responsible harks back to the early Islamic conquests, and its spread and influence of Arabic culture and language across Europe, Africa and Asia, particularly during the Islamic golden age of the 10th to the 14th centuries. The earliest known records of makh\u0101zin in a European language are the Latin magazenum \u201cstoreroom\u201d in 1228 at the seaport of Marseilles, and the Italian magazzino, recorded from 1348. Meanwhile, in the Muslim-ruled Iberian Peninsula, the Andalusian Arabic al-makhzan entered Spanish as almac\u00e9n. The Italian magazzino was the source of the 15th century French magasin \u201cwarehouse, depot, store\u201d. From there the word entered English, documented in 1451; this original sense in English is now obsolete. By the end of the 1500s, the meaning of \u201cmagazine\u201d narrowed to refer to a building, room or compartment (for example, of a ship) for the storage of arms, ammunition, explosives or other military provisions. Much later, from 1868, the military storage dimension of \u201cmagazine\u201d further specialised into the contemporary reference to a detachable receptacle containing cartridges fed automatically in a repeating rifle or machine gun. Meanwhile, it was a matter of time before the word, from the 1600s, was used figuratively, to suggest a store or repertoire \u2013 of resources, ideas, rhetorical weapons. Such a meaning developed specificity, referring for a while to books providing information on specified subjects or for specified groups, such as The Mariners\u2019 Magazine. Periodically published collections of material curated to appeal to particular interests were from the 1600s known as periodicals. Their designation as magazines was first made by British publisher Edward Cave in 1731 with The Gentleman\u2019s Magazine \u2013 a \u201cMonthly Collection, to treasure up, as in a Magazine, the most remarkable Pieces on the Subjects above-mentioned, or at least impartial Abridgements thereof\u201d. This moniker \u2013 contrasting with book publishing \u2013 was embraced. From next month this column will no longer be part of Post Magazine\u2019s store, but will continue to offer its repertoire of contemplations on language elsewhere \u2013 so do keep Language Matters part of your lifestyle.", "summary": "Storehouse, weapons store, holder of gun cartridges, magazine meant several things before a publisher coined its usage to describe a periodical as a \u2018magazine [of] the most remarkable pieces\u2019.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/short-reads/article/3267586/how-magazine-whose-arabic-root-word-means-storehouse-came-denote-periodical", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/06/21/96863b9c-214a-4d4e-aaf4-7cfdda2a7dee_dfb5e4a9.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 00:15:08", "author": "Lisa Lim", "authors": ["Lisa Lim"], "language": "en", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": 0.326}

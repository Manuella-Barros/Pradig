Speaking at the 9th edition of the induction of newly qualified registered nurses, produced by the Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti (ABUAD) ,the legal icon said other great nations of the world had gone through similar challenges but survived.. According to Babalola his resolve to always reward excellence, was borne out of the need to encourage scholarship and industry, so as to serve as lessons to others. \u201cWe are the change that will change the world. We are breeding a new generation of leaders who will change the world for the better\u201d He noted that barely 15 years of existence, the university had been rated the No. 1 University in Nigeria, by the highly respected Times Higher Impact Education Rankings, for two consecutive years (2621 and 2022), and Number 221 globally. He said : \u201d my advice to you all is that Nigerians should not lose hope. There is light at end of the dark tunnel. Since our maiden Convocation on Sunday October, 21, 2013, we have turned out 1,420 graduates. \u201d They are not only doing well, but they are also agents and leaders of reformation. We are the change that will change the world. We are breeding a new generation of leaders who will change the world for the better The legal luminary also rewarded some graduads who distinguished themselves academically. He gave a total sum of N350,000 to the best graduating, and best well behaved student, Rosemary Oriwoh Osanudiamen, Other distinguished students, received N100,000 each,including the only four Male students in the faculty. \u201cIt is a notorious fact thiet i believe in quality education, which can be the to solve the problems of education in this counts. And by quality education, will bring a Justifiable end to illiteracy, bigotry, religious and unnecessary beating of the drum of war. \u201d When i was born more than 90 years ago, Nigeria had no tarred roads, no electricity, no pipe-borne water, and all the modern amenities that make life more worthy of living today we\u2019re lacking then. This was the same thing in Europe in about 1600, as there was no electricity, no pipe-borne water and allied modern amenities of today. \u201d My advice to you all is that Nigeria should not lose hope. There is light at end of the dark tunnel. Since our maiden Convocation on Sunday October, 21, 2013, we have turned out 1,420 graduates. He said he deliberately established the university, to change the face of tertiary education in the country, and make sure, graduates of the institution became agents of change, equipped to change the world. \u201d This is why I want to say I am not happy with the role of alumni of universities, especially in ABUAD\u201d, he said \u201cWe expect them to exhibit the type of philanthropy inherent in me, which made me to sell all my properties in Lagos, Ibadan, Abuja, Port-Harcourt and England,in order to set up this wave-making university. \u201d I expect the alumni to have a solid association, and an unmistakable presence. They should have a viable Secretariat which will be sending Newsletters, containing the achievements of their members and institutions, all over the world. \u201d Unfortunately, there is nothing like that today. This must change. For example, as an alumnus of the University of London, i still receive the university\u2019s Newsletter every month. The latest, being the one i received only yesterday. \u201d Don\u2019t forget that i did not attend the university of London physically. 1 obtained my B.Sc. Economics in 1959 and my LL. 8 Honours in 1963 by correspondence. Ever since then, and up today, i still know what is happening there, and with the advantage of the new media such as Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, among others, things are getting better\u201d \u201d The alumni should even have a Bank Account, where every alumnus should make monthly donations, which can in turn, be used for annual awards, and annual gifts to deserving students of the university. \u201d If every alumnus, donates N50,000 into this account, you can imagine what it would amount to. This will be used to help those who lose their parents, and/or their jobs. This way, you will be your brother\u2019s keeper. He consequently directed the university Registrar, and the Director of International Collaboration and Linkages of the university, to immediately initiate the setting up of a viable and functional alumni association. \u201d Henceforth, each graduating student of the university should make commitment to the alumni association, before receiving his/her certificate\u201d, he added. The registrar, of Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria, NMCN, Dr Farouk Abubakar, represented by a Director, Yahaya Sumi, urged the inductees to explore new opportunities in the profession, and be good ambassadors of their chosen careers. Abubakar said: \u201cI encourage you to learn from your senior colleagues. Be good ambassadors of the nursing profession and explore new opportunities.\u201d In her address of welcome, the Vice Chancellor, Prof Smaranda Olarinde, described ABUAD as the ultimate destination for teaching and learning of the Nursing Science in the country, urging parents who are desirous of the best for their children and wards, to always make it a firs place of choice. According to her, the faculty recorder 100% pass in their Council Final Qualifying Examination for Nurses in 2023 and 2024, and they also, all passed their midwifery examination in 2024. \u201d Besides, the faculty also crowned it all with another 100% in the Public Health Professional Examination in 2024\", she said.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"620\" height=\"308\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240609-WA0021.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240609-WA0021.jpg 620w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240609-WA0021-300x149.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" /></div>&#8230;..produces newxser of qualified nurses\u00a0 Foremost Lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) Aare Afe Babalola&#160; has admonished Nigerians not to lose hope in spite of the daunting economic challenges.&#160; Speaking at the 9th edition of the induction of newly qualified registered nurses, produced by the Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti (ABUAD) ,the legal icon said [&#8230;]", "url": "https://independent.ng/economic-hardships-dont-lose-hope-yet-afe-babalola-tells-nigerians/", "image": "https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240609-WA0021.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:08:44", "author": "Popoola Yaqoub", "authors": ["Popoola Yaqoub"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ng", "sentiment": 0.263}

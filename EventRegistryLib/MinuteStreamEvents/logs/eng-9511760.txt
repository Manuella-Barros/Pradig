There are expected to be several departures with the likes of Casemiro, 32, and Raphael Varane, 31, headed for the exit door.\n\nHowever, Manchester United's squad will also be boosted by arrivals under Sir Jim Ratcliffe's first transfer window as co-owner. His INEOS team are looking at young talent to help improve the team at Old Trafford.\n\nLeverkusen pair Tapsoba, 25, and Frimpong, 23, are targets having been instrumental for Xabi Alonso's Bundesliga champions. They've helped Die Werkself remain unbeaten across competitions and dethrone Bayern Munich.\n\nTapsoba is one of Europe's most exciting centre-backs having majorly impressed at BayArena. He's made 38 appearances across competitions, helping Leverkusen keep 15 clean sheets while chipping in with three goals and one assist.\n\nMeanwhile, Frimpong has experience playing in England as he started in Manchester City's youth ranks. The Dutch right-back has become a revelation, with 13 goals and 11 assists in 40 games across competitions this season.\n\nManchester United also have other targets such as Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite in mind. The 21-year-old England international has enjoyed a breakout season with the Toffees during their fight against relegation.\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers midfielder Joao Gomes and winger Pedro Neto are also in the Red Devils' sights. The duo have been crucial for Gary O'Neil this season.\n\nGomes, 23, is a tenacious Brazilian midfielder who has been a rock in midfield for Wolves. Neto, 24, has long been regarded as one of the English top flight's most exciting wingers but he comes with a concerning injury record.\n\nBorussia Dortmund frontman Donyell Malen is also on the shortlist and a move for him could have implications on Jadon Sancho's potential departure. The Dutch forward has bagged 13 goals and five assists in 34 games across competitions this season.\n\nSancho is on loan at Dortmund until the end of the season but seemingly has no future at Manchester United. A potential swap deal could be an option for the two European giants.\n\nFabrizio Romano gives an update on Manchester United's pursuit of Bayer Leverkusen's Jeremie Frimpong\n\nManchester United seem eager to strengthen their defense this summer. Ten Hag has dealt with several injuries to his backline this season. This has led to right-back duo Diogo Dalot and Aaron Wan-Bissaka operating as makeshift left-backs.\n\nThe Red Devils are long-term admirers of Frimpong who has dazzled in the Bundesliga. His pace, agility, and vision have been key for Alonso's champions, who are also in the UEFA Europa League semifinals.\n\nTransfer expert Romano confirmed Manchester United's long-term interest in Frimpong but claimed transfer plans from a financial perspective haven't been formulated yet (via Caught Offside):\n\n\"Man United have been scouting Frimpong for long time; he was already on the list before the World Cup in 2022. But Man United have not decided yet how much they want to invest on each position, this will be part of strategy in May and not now.\"\n\nFrimpong reportedly has a \u00a334 million release clause which could be a bargain given his excellent campaign.

Despite this reality, rumours are continuing to swirl as to which players United could look to target at the end of the season. Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos Group completed a 25 percent takeover of United earlier this year and will be overseeing the transfer business this summer as part of their control of footballing operations at Old Trafford.\n\nThe latest rumours around United concern a potential new midfielder and new defender being signed by the Reds. Reports in Germany are claiming that United are stepping up their interest in Bayer Leverkusen full-back Jeremie Frimpong.\n\nAccording to Sport Bild, via Sport Witness, United have \"intensified contact\" with Bayer Leverkusen over a potential deal to sign Frimpong. The Reds have been linked with the signing of the Netherlands international for several weeks, with Frimpong playing a key role in helping Leverkusen stay unbeaten all campaign and win the Bundesliga title.\n\nREAD MORE: Sir Dave Brailsford's stark message to Man United players behind closed doors that Ten Hag must fear\n\nREAD MORE: Sir Jim Ratcliffe already knows Thomas Tuchel demands as Manchester United warning is clear\n\nDespite playing as a right-back for the majority of the season, Frimpong has still managed to score 13 goals and provide 11 assists. That form has seen Frimpong linked with a big-money move this summer, with United reportedly the club determined to acquire his services.\n\nElsewhere, Barcelona have reportedly made a decision on the future of Frenkie de Jong. United have been heavily linked with a move for De Jong ever since Ten Hag was named as managed two years ago.\n\nDespite the links, De Jong has remained at the Camp Nou but that could be about to change. According to Spanish news outlet Sport, the La Liga giants are considering letting De Jong leave the club this summer in order to fund possible new additions ahead of next season.\n\nIt has been claimed that there is \"interest\" from the Premier League, with Paris Saint-Germain also apparently in the running. However, the report states that De Jong has no plans to leave Barcelona this summer, despite the club's stance of being open to the midfielder departing at the end of the season.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_wakefield@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Mark Wakefield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremie_Frimpong", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeremie Frimpong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenkie_de_Jong", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Frenkie de Jong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ratcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Ratcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behind_closed_doors_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Behind closed doors (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "German Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bild", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bild"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverkusen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leverkusen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leverkusen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Nou", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Camp Nou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29055646.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2147815287.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511760", "eventUri": "eng-9511760", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

The upcoming transfer window, buoyed by Sir Jim Ratcliffe's inaugural season as co-owner, promises a blend of departures and exciting arrivals. This strategic shuffle underscores a vibrant new chapter in the storied club's history.\n\nAt the heart of United's ambitious overhaul are Edmond Tapsoba and Jeremie Frimpong, two standout performers who have been instrumental in Bayer Leverkusen's recent success under manager Xabi Alonso. Their contributions have not only propelled Leverkusen to the top of the Bundesliga but also caught the keen eye of Manchester United's scouting network.\n\nEdmond Tapsoba, at just 25, has emerged as one of Europe's most formidable centre-backs. His tenure at BayArena has been marked by an impressive tally of 38 appearances this season, where he has been central to Leverkusen securing 15 clean sheets. Moreover, Tapsoba's ability to contribute offensively with three goals and an assist adds a versatile edge to his already robust defensive skills.\n\nJeremie Frimpong, formerly of Manchester City's youth squad, has flourished in Germany, evolving into a sensational right-back. With 13 goals and 11 assists across all competitions this season, Frimpong's offensive prowess complements his solid defensive play, making him an alluring target for the Red Devils. His release clause, reportedly at \u00a334 million, presents a viable option for Manchester United, keen on bolstering their defensive lineup.\n\nThe pursuit of Tapsoba and Frimpong is part of a broader strategy that includes other promising talents. Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite and Wolves' duo Joao Gomes and Pedro Neto are also on Manchester United's shortlist, each bringing unique strengths to potentially address various squad needs. Gomes offers tenacity in midfield, while Neto's flair on the wing is tempered by his injury concerns.\n\nAdditionally, Borussia Dortmund's Donyell Malen is another name linked with a move to Manchester, potentially influencing Jadon Sancho's future at the club. With Sancho's status at Manchester United uncertain, Malen's potential arrival could reshuffle the offensive dynamics.\n\nWhile the allure of new signings is strong, Manchester United is yet to finalize the financial aspects of their summer strategy. As noted by transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, the club has been monitoring Frimpong for an extended period, but the exact investment in each position will be determined later in May. This cautious approach reflects a thoughtful balancing of ambition with financial prudence, ensuring that each move aligns with the club's long-term objectives.\n\nIn conclusion, Manchester United's summer transfer strategy appears both aggressive and nuanced, aiming to build a team capable of returning to the top of both domestic and European football.

Sport Witness adds that there is good reason for any interested parties to get a wriggle on: Frimpong reportedly has a \u20ac40m (\u00a334.4m) release clause in his contract that expires after this summer's Euros.\n\nThat means Leverkusen would be able to command a higher fee later in the summer if nobody comes in to trigger the clause and get a deal done beforehand. It seems that at this point, nobody has done that, instead preferring to test Leverkusen's resolve to hold out for the full whack.\n\n23-year-old Frimpng earned his first full cap for the Netherlands last year and will be expecting to be part of Ronald Koeman's plans for the Euros - especially with the squad size set to be expanded back to 26.", "source": {"uri": "fourfourtwo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "fourfourtwo.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremie_Frimpong", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jeremie Frimpong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverkusen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leverkusen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leverkusen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C5B8zbf83La2JK8rc4KMm-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511760", "eventUri": "eng-9511760", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

In apparent snub to the King, Harry's Coronation medal given to him and others involved in the King's formal ascension to the throne last May.\n\nPrince Harry wore a medal that he was awarded by the late Queen for his 'services to the monarchy' today as he arrived for the Invictus Games service at St Pauls\n\nHarry's medals (left to right) comprised his Afghanistan service medal as well as Golden, Diamond and Platinum Jubilee medals for his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II\n\nIn apparent snub to the King, Harry's Coronation medal given to him and others involved in the King's formal ascension to the throne last May\n\nHarry's KCVO was given to him by Queen Elizabeth in June 2015. It came the same month that the Duke left the army following 10 years of service.\n\nIt is the second time that the Duke has chosen to forgo wearing the coronation medal marking his father's coronation. Last month while handing out an award to a top-performing American soldier it was notably absent.\n\nRoyal experts said that the time that the absence of the medal was an apparent snub to his father after he banned from wearing military dress to the historical Coronation, after stepping down as a senior working member of the royal family.\n\nHarry was one of 400,000 people to have received the Coronation medal as it was given to all those who helped actively contribute to the service at Westminster Abbey.\n\nThe emblems were also given to serving members of the armed forces, frontline emergency service personnel and public employed prison service personnel in recognition of their public service.\n\nLiving recipients of the George Cross and Victoria Cross were also given the ceremonial honour.\n\nHarry was one of 400,000 people to have received the Coronation medal (pictured)\n\nHarry's KCVO was given to him by Queen Elizabeth in June 2015. It came the same month that the Duke left the army following 10 years of service\n\nRoyal expert Richard Fitzwilliams claimed that Harry was deliberately seeking to distance himself from his old life as he makes the US his permanent home.\n\nHe told Newsweek: 'Those eligible who were involved in the coronation were given a medal.\n\n'The Sussexes do nothing by chance and this clearly emphasises or is intended to emphasise his distance from the royal family.'\n\nAnd he added to The Sun: 'The Sussexes are well aware that every single thing they do, everything they wear, everything they say, is all going to be examined.\n\n'The problem is that if he chooses not to wear the coronation medal, it will certainly be seen as a snub to King Charles.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

At this event marking the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, the Duke of Sussex used his attire to pay homage to his period as a senior working Royal despite the rest of the Royal Family choosing not to attend.\n\nThe KCVO Neck Order and Star in question are awards given for services to the monarchy, falling under the Royal Victorian Order - a prestigious order of knighthood. Tom Quinn, a noted Royal author, speculates that the act was a symbolic gesture from Harry to his familial relations, indicating his valuable contributions to the monarchy.\n\nSpeaking exclusively with The Mirror, Tom commented: \"Harry was seen wearing his Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order medal at St Paul's Cathedral for the Invictus service. The medal was given to Harry in 2015 by his late grandmother Elizabeth II for 'services to the monarchy'.\"\n\nNotably, Tom suggested: \"Wearing this was Harry's way of reminding his family that his grandmother valued his contribution, even if his father and brother do not. Wearing the KCVO neck and star was also Harry's way of pointing out that he's not the bad boy he's portrayed as being by his father and brother.\"\n\nBut, Mr Quinn, reflected, it may also have carried an even more defiant message amid the royal rift: \"It's Harry's way of saying he still supports the monarchy despite the way he feels he has been treated. Perhaps more importantly, wearing the medal is Harry's way of saying 'You've taken everything else from me, but you can't take this!',\" added Mr Quinn.\n\nIt could be seen as a message to Prince William and King Charles Prince Harry was pictured wearing his KCVO Neck Order and Star\n\nHarry was bestowed with knighthood by his grandmother the Queen in 2015 for his service to the monarchy, granting him the title of a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in a private ceremony at Buckingham Palace.\n\nBesides the KCVO Neck Order and Star, Harry also earned an Afghanistan Service Medal and a Golden, Diamond and Platinum Jubilee medal, all proudly worn to the service. The decision to sport the KCVO Neck Order and Star came after the revelation that King Charles was unable to find time to meet his son.\n\nPrince Harry sent a message to his family\n\nThe Duke's representative stated: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme. The duke of course is understanding of his father's diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_gibb@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Jessica Gibb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "joseph_wilkes@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Joseph Wilkes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Victorian_Order", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Victorian Order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_chivalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Order of chivalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/article32776482.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_invictus-games-tenth-anniversary-service-london-uk-08-may-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553734", "eventUri": "eng-9553734", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Tellingly, Harry was alone when he arrived shortly before 5pm for the service. There were no other royals in attendance; King Charles and Queen Camilla, along with other prominent royals, were instead two miles away mingling with guests at the first Buckingham Palace garden party of the year.\n\nIt seems clear that the gulf between Harry and his family is wider than ever - and royal watchers were quick to notice a seeming 'snub' as the Prince stepped out solo.\n\nHarry, dressed in a suit, wore four medals on his chest including one awarded by his late grandmother, the Queen. He also donned his KCVO Neck Order and Star - given for service to the monarchy and awarded as part of the Royal Victorian Order. But for the second time in recent weeks he failed to wear his King's Coronation Medal.\n\nThe medal was given to 400 recipients involved in the Coronation ceremonies and processions, as well as serving members of the Armed Forces and emergency service workers.\n\nHarry once again decided not to wear his Coronation medal\n\nAt the end of April, Harry presented a military award via video, filmed by the backdoor of his Montecito home. He wore the same four medals as he did on Wednesday - and again the Coronation Medal was missing.\n\nOn both occasions, he put on his Operational Service Medal for Afghanistan, which he earned in 2008 for his service in Helmand Province, the late Queen's Golden Jubilee Medal, which was awarded in 2002 to everyone who had been in active service for five years, Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee Medal, which was given to members of the emergency services, Armed Forces, prison service, and the royal household in 2012, and the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee Medal.\n\nSimilarly, Harry did not wear the Coronation medal when he delivered a video monologue for Stand Up For Heroes in New York last November.\n\nHarry was last in the UK in February when he met with King Charles for a flying visit following the monarch's cancer diagnosis. The journey from the US took Harry more than 10 hours - but his meeting with his father at Clarence House in London lasted less than 60 minutes.\n\nThere had been speculation of a reunion this time around. But the King's failure to see his son suggests a deep rift and a sign that \"their relationship is terminally damaged\", according to royal expert Jennie Bond. \"In a sensible world, Harry would stay with his dad at Clarence House - they could have cosy chats in perfect privacy and with all the security Harry wants.\"\n\nJennie offered insights into Harry's relationship with his older brother Prince William, saying: \"As regards William, that does appear to be a terminally damaged relationship.\n\n\"In a way, it seems the boot is now very much on the other foot. Previously it was Harry who was the 'victim' looking for an apology for all his perceived grievances. Now those grievances must seem utterly trivial (even to Harry) in the face of a very real problem: cancer.\"\n\nHighlighting the gravity of the situation, she added: \"Kate and William are involved in a frightening fight and I don't think they have the will or the strength to confront someone, even a brother, who picked a fight over issues that seem pathetic by comparison.\n\n\"William is doing everything he possibly can to protect his wife and I very much doubt that they want to deal with 'the Harry problem' right now, if ever.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?

The Royal Family decided not to attend the event, but that didn't stop Harry from paying tribute to his time as a senior working royal.\n\nThe KCVO Neck Order and Star Harry wore is given for service to the monarchy. The medal is awarded as part of the Royal Victorian Order - a monarchical order of knighthood. Royal author Tom Quinn believes the move is a message to Charles and William that Harry offered a \"valued contribution\" to the monarchy.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Prince Harry's eight-word response to fans as he walked away from cheering crowds\n\nPrince Harry was pictured wearing his KCVO Neck Order and Star It could be seen as a message to Prince William and King Charles\n\nSpeaking exclusively to The Mirror, Tom said: \"Harry was seen wearing his Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order medal at St Paul's Cathedral for the Invictus service. The medal was given to Harry in 2015 by his late grandmother Elizabeth II for 'services to the monarchy'.\n\n\"Wearing this was Harry's way of reminding his family that his grandmother valued his contribution, even if his father and brother do not. Wearing the KCVO neck and star was also Harry's way of pointing out that he's not the bad boy he's portrayed as being by his father and brother.\n\n\"It's Harry's way of saying he still supports the monarchy despite the way he feels he has been treated. Perhaps more importantly, wearing the medal is Harry's way of saying 'You've taken everything else from me, but you can't take this!'\"\n\nThe Duke of Sussex attended a service for the Invictus Games\n\nHarry was knighted by his grandmother the Queen in 2015 for his service to the monarchy. He was made a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) privately at Buckingham Palace.\n\nAs well as the KCVO Neck Order and Star, Harry has an Afghanistan Service Medal and a Golden, Diamond and Platinum Jubilee medal, which he wore to the service. Harry's decision to wear the KCVO Neck Order and Star comes after it was announced King Charles was too busy to meet his son.\n\nIn a statement, Harry's spokesperson said: \"In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty's full programme.

According to The Mirror, Harry wore four medals on his jacket: his Operational Service Medal for Afghanistan, Queen Elizabeth's Queen's Golden Jubilee Medal, Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee Medal, and Queen Elizabeth's Platinum Jubilee Medal.\n\nBut he notably didn't wear his King's Coronation Medal -- for the second time.\n\nAs for the real reason King Charles is snubbing his youngest son during this visit, a friend tells the Daily Beast that \"Harry has made things very difficult for himself by saying such cruel and hurtful things about Camilla. Charles loves his sons, but he also loves his wife. The last few months have made it very clear how important she is; she has been the one propping up the whole edifice.\"\n\nThe friend also explained, in part, that \"Harry has made it very clear, very publicly, that he despises her.

But now, the Internet is analyzing Prince Harry's outfit, and a major detail was spotted (or rather, omitted).\n\nNoticeably missing? His dad's medal, the King's Coronation Medal, which he received for the King's coronation last year.\n\nThis has been perceived as a snub to the King, but this is actually not the first time this happened. In a video he recorded to present a Soldier of the Year award in April 2024, Prince Harry was seen wearing the exact same medals without his dads in the lineup.\n\nA royal insider at the time, explained why. Perhaps the same explanation applies to yesterday's medal omission.\n\n\"Harry's failure to wear his father's Coronation medal wasn't intended as a snub to the King,\" royal commentator Ephraim Hardcastle told the Daily Mail back in April.\n\n\"My source whispers that the medal was 'swing-mounted' on a short ribbon and needed to be sent to a specialist to affix to a longer ribbon and mount on a hard backing to stop it from swinging around. Maybe the King should have FedExed his travelling yeoman to California to do the job.\"", "source": {"uri": "justjared.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Just Jared"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeoman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yeoman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Militaria", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Militaria", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical_Personages", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical Personages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn01.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2024/05/harry-inv.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553734", "eventUri": "eng-9553734", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 87, "textEnd": 92}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

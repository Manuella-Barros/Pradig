The research was published in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians.\n\nResearchers estimated the number of invasive cancer cases (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers) and cancer deaths both overall and for 30 cancer types that were attributable to potentially modifiable risk factors. The population included adults who were 30 years of age and older in 2019.\n\nThe researchers estimated that, in 2019, 40.0% of cancers were attributable to the risk factors evaluated, and 44.0% of cancer deaths were attributable to the risk factors. The population-attributable fraction (PAF) for each risk factor is listed in the table below.\n\n\"For 19 of 30 evaluated cancer types, more than one half of the cancer cases and deaths were attributable to the potentially modifiable risk factors considered in this study,\" the researchers noted.\n\nThe cancers with the highest number of cases attributable to the risk factors were:\n\nLung cancer (n=201,660) Female breast cancer (n=83,840) Melanoma (n=82,710) Colorectal cancer (n=78,440) Urinary bladder cancer (n=40,720).\n\nThe cancers with the highest number of deaths attributable to the risk factors were:\n\nLung cancer (n=122,740) Colorectal cancer (n=25,800) Liver cancer (n=14,720) Esophageal cancer (n=13,600) Pancreatic cancer (n=13,260).\n\n\"These findings reinforce that the morbidity and premature mortality from cancer in the United States can be substantially reduced through broad and equitable implementation of known preventive initiatives, such as excise taxes on cigarettes to reduce smoking, screening for and treating HCV infection, and vaccination against HPV infection,\" the researchers wrote. \"However, further implementation research is needed for broad application of known interventions, particularly for excess body weight, unhealthy diet, alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity. Tailored and mutually reinforcing interventions are more likely to mitigate these risk factors, especially in historically marginalized populations, which are usually disproportionately affected by these factors.\"\n\nDisclosures: This research was supported by the American Cancer Society, and some authors are employed by the American Cancer Society, which receives grants from private and corporate foundations.

And that increase magnified the financial havoc cancer can cause.\n\nI am a doctoral candidate in pharmaceutical health outcomes and policy. I conducted this study with two other scholars, Douglas Thornton at the University of Houston and Chan Shen at Penn State.\n\nWe wanted to learn how the ACA had changed what cancer patients spend on treatment costs. To find out, we examined data from a U.S. government database spanning the years 2011 to 2020. We excluded people treated for nonmelanoma skin cancer, because it's more easily treatable than other cancers.\n\nThese expenditures included health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs such as copays, deductibles, hospital stays, doctor's office visits, emergency services and home health care services. We compared these costs over the three years before the ACA's implementation, 2011 to 2013, and the seven years after, 2014 to 2020.\n\nWe excluded people 65 or older to focus on patients in the workforce. We also adjusted all costs for inflation, expressing them in 2020 dollars, and took steps to not let insurance status changes affect our results.\n\nTreatment costs for the more than 16 million Americans who were 18 to 64 and had cancer from 2011 to 2020 varied based on their income.\n\nFor those eligible for Medicaid, spending fell by about 31% from an average of $4,000 annually in 2014 to $2,750 in 2020.\n\nCancer patients with at least $51,040 in annual income spent an average of $13,000 annually on health care costs before the ACA's implementation. Their costs increased by up 24%, an average of $3,120, by 2020.\n\nThese people were also more than twice as likely after the ACA's rollout as before it to spend a large part of their income on health care - making it hard for them to afford other basics such as food and housing.\n\nCancer treatment costs for people with annual incomes ranging from about $17,600 to $51,000 declined somewhat but not significantly.\n\nAbout 1.9 million Americans are diagnosed with cancer annually. Treatment costs rose to nearly $210 billion in 2020, up 20% from 2015 levels.\n\nWhat patients pay varies, based largely on whether they have insurance coverage and what kind it is. Costs for cancer patients also vary based on their treatments and how well they tolerate them. The costs of drugs, doctors appointments and hospital services range widely.\n\nSome patients spend so much on cancer care that they struggle to pay their bills, a situation known as \"financial toxicity.\" Many cancer survivors owe debts they can't repay and even lose their homes. It's common for people who have had cancer to avoid filling prescriptions or getting treatment to curb their spending - endangering their health.\n\nNew cancer treatments are promising, but many of them are very expensive. In 2022, the average yearly cost of cancer treatments reached $260,000 per patient, compared with $63,500 10 years earlier.\n\nHowever, not all cancer patients are benefiting from these medical advances. So my research team is now working on creating predictive models to help health care providers match patients to the treatments that they're most likely to respond well to.\n\nOur primary focus will be on immune checkpoint inhibitors, a newer kind of cancer treatment that helps a patient's immune system do a better job of attacking cancer cells.\n\nThe Research Brief is a short take about interesting academic work.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

The number of annual cancer deaths in Africa is projected by the WHO to double to more than 1 million by 2030 unless urgent action is taken. The growing number of cases is driven by environmental, genetic and lifestyle factors including urbanization, pollution and tobacco consumption.\n\nThe cancer care burden in Africa is worsened by limited public spending on health compared to high-income countries. African governments spend, on average, less than $100 per capita on health costs, compared to about $8,000 in the United States. Chemotherapeutic medicines in Africa cost between three and six times more than international reference prices, putting them out of reach for many cancer patients.\n\nThe AstraZeneca program, launched in May in Kenya, aims to screen 1 million people in the East African country across three different cancer types - lung, breast and prostate cancer. It also aims to train more than 10,000 healthcare professionals, support more than 100 oncology centers, and boost access to critical cancer medicines.\n\nAnd the WHO in January launched a three-year initiative to promote early breast and cervical cancer care detection in three African countries -- C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Kenya and Zimbabwe.\n\nDavid Fredrickson, AstraZeneca executive vice president, oncology business unit, told Semafor Africa that investing in early detection was \"probably the most significant way\" to achieve better outcomes including longer, healthier lives for patients, lower treatment costs, and reduced strain on health systems.\n\nHe added that early detection keeps patients out of the wider hospital system and means fewer patients require medicine, which reduces overall costs.\n\nSeveral African countries have in recent years embarked on expansion of cancer diagnostics services in primary healthcare facilities, particularly for cervical cancer. Among them are Uganda, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Tanzania.\n\nCancer care in Africa remains expensive, pushing it out of reach for many on the continent. With health budgets already constrained in many countries, interventions around early detection are crucial for the improvement of cancer care in Africa.\n\nImproving the affordability and accessibility of cancer care however also requires other elements to be in place, and it's important not to lose sight of them. In Kenya, for instance, prescribed drugs remain out of reach for many cancer patients, creating a desperate situation. The Pharmacy and Poisons board in May warned that fake breast cancer medication had \"flooded the market\", cautioning that the drugs' safety could not be ascertained.\n\nMercy Cheptoo had to quit her job as cashier to take care of her mother who was diagnosed with breast cancer in Nairobi in 2022. \"It's taken everything from us. We've had four fundraisers so far, and yet sometimes we still didn't have enough to get the drugs she needed on time,\" she told Semafor Africa.\n\nPolicymakers should channel more public funds towards cancer care and research.\n\nInsurers should also be incentivized to provide expanded cancer care coverage across the continent. Without urgent action, Africa's cancer burden is expected to double to 2.4 million new cases and 1.6 million deaths annually by 2045 according to the WHO.\n\nWhile investment in early detection is \"critical\" to better clinical outcomes, African governments and their healthcare partners need to improve the entire cancer care supply chain, said Philana Mugenyi, director of government affairs for sub-Saharan Africa at GE Healthcare. She told Semafor Africa that includes prevention and awareness-raising efforts, as well as expanding the specialist workforce, healthcare financing, and technology.\n\nChinese genomics firm BGI Genomics in April launched its cervical cancer screening program in Africa in May, with Rwanda as the first beneficiary.\n\nThe program aims to provide 20,000 human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA tests for local women in a bid to enhance cervical cancer detection and prevention efforts, and improve local medical testing capabilities.\n\n\"This initiative is pivotal for enhancing the well-being of our community,\" Pudence Rubingisa, governor of Rwanda's Eastern Province, said in a statement. \"We are dedicated to leveraging all available resources, including our local health workers and agencies, to facilitate effective screening, awareness, and educational efforts.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), cancer cases in India are expected to increase by 25% by 2025, with an estimated 1.5 million new cases recorded each year.\n\nOne of the key reasons for this increase is the expanding population and longer life expectancy, which leads to a higher prevalence of age-related malignancies. Lifestyle changes, such as rising tobacco use, bad diets, and physical inactivity, are other contributing causes.\n\nTo address this growing worry, the Indian government has created efforts like the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases, and Stroke (NPCDCS), which promotes cancer awareness, screening, and early detection.\n\nIncreased funding for cancer research, increased access to healthcare facilities, and public awareness initiatives are critical to mitigating the impact of cancer in India. Furthermore, adopting healthy lifestyle habits such as a balanced diet, regular exercise, and abstaining from tobacco can help reduce the risk of developing cancer.\n\nAs the country struggles with the expanding cancer threat, it is critical to take a multifaceted strategy to address this growing health catastrophe. Working together, we can lessen the cancer burden in India and enhance the quality of life for millions of people.\n\nIn conclusion, the identification of cancer as an important health issue in India reflects a sobering truth. Cancer has become the country's biggest cause of mortality, owing to increased incidence rates and poor healthcare infrastructure. However, this disclosure provides a possibility for action. By identifying the expanding cancer burden, we can fight to raise awareness, improve early detection, and expand treatment options.\n\nTogether, we can remove the stigma associated with cancer and advocate for a holistic approach to combating the disease, possibly saving lives and enhancing the quality of existence for many thousands of Indians living with cancer.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Council_of_Medical_Research", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Council of Medical Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astrology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prevalence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life expectancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedentary_lifestyle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sedentary lifestyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthy_diet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Healthy diet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(epidemiology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incidence (epidemiology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social stigma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Ayurveda", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Ayurveda", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/Disease_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/Disease Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2024/07/23/1446613-cancer.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758044", "eventUri": "eng-9758044", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 17, "textEnd": 24}], "sentiment": -0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

And that increase magnified the financial havoc cancer can cause.\n\nI am a doctoral candidate in pharmaceutical health outcomes and policy. I conducted this study with two other scholars, Douglas Thornton at the University of Houston and Chan Shen at Penn State.\n\nWe wanted to learn how the ACA had changed what cancer patients spend on treatment costs. To find out, we examined data from a U.S. government database spanning the years 2011 to 2020. We excluded people treated for nonmelanoma skin cancer, because it's more easily treatable than other cancers.\n\nThese expenditures included health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs such as copays, deductibles, hospital stays, doctor's office visits, emergency services and home health care services. We compared these costs over the three years before the ACA's implementation, 2011 to 2013, and the seven years after, 2014 to 2020.\n\nWe excluded people 65 or older to focus on patients in the workforce. We also adjusted all costs for inflation, expressing them in 2020 dollars, and took steps to not let insurance status changes affect our results.\n\nTreatment costs for the more than 16 million Americans who were 18 to 64 and had cancer from 2011 to 2020 varied based on their income.\n\nFor those eligible for Medicaid, spending fell by about 31% from an average of $4,000 annually in 2014 to $2,750 in 2020.\n\nCancer patients with at least $51,040 in annual income spent an average of $13,000 annually on health care costs before the ACA's implementation. Their costs increased by up 24%, an average of $3,120, by 2020.\n\nThese people were also more than twice as likely after the ACA's rollout as before it to spend a large part of their income on health care - making it hard for them to afford other basics such as food and housing.\n\nCancer treatment costs for people with annual incomes ranging from about $17,600 to $51,000 declined somewhat but not significantly.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nAbout 1.9 million Americans are diagnosed with cancer annually. Treatment costs rose to nearly $210 billion in 2020, up 20% from 2015 levels.\n\nWhat patients pay varies, based largely on whether they have insurance coverage and what kind it is. Costs for cancer patients also vary based on their treatments and how well they tolerate them. The costs of drugs, doctors appointments and hospital services range widely.\n\nSome patients spend so much on cancer care that they struggle to pay their bills, a situation known as \"financial toxicity.\" Many cancer survivors owe debts they can't repay and even lose their homes. It's common for people who have had cancer to avoid filling prescriptions or getting treatment to curb their spending - endangering their health.\n\nWhat's next\n\nNew cancer treatments are promising, but many of them are very expensive. In 2022, the average yearly cost of cancer treatments reached $260,000 per patient, compared with $63,500 10 years earlier.\n\nHowever, not all cancer patients are benefiting from these medical advances. So my research team is now working on creating predictive models to help health care providers match patients to the treatments that they're most likely to respond well to.\n\nOur primary focus will be on immune checkpoint inhibitors, a newer kind of cancer treatment that helps a patient's immune system do a better job of attacking cancer cells.\n\nThe Research Brief is a short take about interesting academic work.\n\nOlajumoke Olateju does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.\n\n/Courtesy of The Conversation.

Kashmir is the geographical region where esophageal, gastric and lung cancers have a high incidence rate both among men and women. Two important risk factors, contributing to this prevalence are increased consumption of salted tea and hookah/ tobacco smoking, Every year there is a marked increase in the number of cancer patients registered in the valley's premiere tertiary care institute, SKIMS, where increasing number of cancer patients, especially from poor backgrounds, continue to pour in for treatment.\n\nSounding alarm bells, leading oncologists caution that cancer has become the number one killer disease in Kashmir and that there's high need for increased quality cancer awareness and treatment facilities to ease the sufferings of rising cancer patients in the valley. Going beyond the statistics, the ten leading types of cancers based on sites are esophagus and GE Junctional, lung, stomach, colorectal, skin, laryngopharyngeal, brain cancers, acute leukemias, lymphomas, specifically including prostate and brain cancers in males and breast, ovarian and gallbladder cancers in female. Esophagus and stomach cancers alone constituted over 27% of the total cancers. Gastrointestinal malignancies are the commonest malignancies in Kashmir valley followed by lung cancer in males and breast cancer in females.\n\nCancer has no single cause. It is complex, just like diabetes and heart disease. The rise in cancer cases can be attributed to several factors. Adoption of poor food habits, unhealthy lifestyle, longer working hours, smoking, use of alcohol, use of contraceptives, constipation, and lack of exercise are some of them, another significant reason for the rise in cancer incidence is the lack of proper cancer screening facilities, particularly in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. Regular screening and early diagnosis can play a major role in fighting the fatal disease.\n\nKashmir is witnessing a surge in the rate of thyroid cancer patients. However, if detected early, chances of survival of such patients are more compared to patients suffering with other types of cancers. In order to curb the cancer rate, we must change our way of life, that is, we must let go of a sedentary lifestyle. Other changes may include a complete ban on smoking, increased intake of fruits and vegetables rich in Vitamin A and vitamin C. Cooking and dietary systems must be revised, and we must cut down on salt tea.\n\nMoreover, never drink hot tea. Besides that, ripening agents must be banned and colouring agents must be avoided or used under limits. In addition to reducing the risk of developing cancer, the risk of developing heart disease, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases might also be prevented by eating more fruits and vegetables. Broccoli, cabbage, collard greens, kale, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts are all cruciferous vegetables.

While last summer's shortages of carboplatin and cisplatin have subsided, the underlying forces behind the shortages remain and now several drugs essential for treating childhood and young adult cancers are scarce. In fact, a recent survey showed 89% of cancer centers are still struggling with adequate supply of at least one drug used to treat cancer.\n\nAlthough lawmakers have introduced a handful of bills to address various parts of the problem; this fall looks like the best time for a comprehensive bill to be introduced.\n\nASCO needs you to share your experiences dealing with drug shortages so we can share those stories directly with Congress.\n\nLawmakers must remember the people and the patients behind this issue to act, and your stories will help ensure that they do.\n\nFederal cancer research funding\n\nCongress has until Sept. 30 to finalize funding for fiscal year (FY) 2025 and with several competing priorities, a tight budget, and an upcoming election, cancer research and biomedical funding could be at risk.\n\nFederally funded cancer research saves lives and leads to improved outcomes for patients. As drivers of innovation, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Cancer Institute (NCI) have been behind nearly every significant advancement in cancer prevention, detection, and treatment over the last 50 years. Thanks to this work, there are a record 18 million cancer survivors in the United States today.\n\nReducing funding now will result in fewer lives saved from cancer for decades to come.\n\nASCO needs you to make clear to Congress that we cannot afford to take that risk. Young researchers could leave the field and progress made on cancer prevention, detection, treatment, and survivorship could slip without adequate investments.\n\nShare your experiences as an oncology professional about federal cancer research and the essential role it plays reducing incidence and deaths from cancer now and in the future.\n\nFirst-hand experiences from providers, researchers and all those involved in cancer care remain among the most powerful motivators for change.\n\nPlease share your story with ASCO and/or encourage your colleagues to do the same.

And that increase magnified the financial havoc cancer can cause.\n\nI am a doctoral candidate in pharmaceutical health outcomes and policy. I conducted this study with two other scholars, Douglas Thornton at the University of Houston and Chan Shen at Penn State.\n\nWe wanted to learn how the ACA had changed what cancer patients spend on treatment costs. To find out, we examined data from a U.S. government database spanning the years 2011 to 2020. We excluded people treated for nonmelanoma skin cancer, because it's more easily treatable than other cancers.\n\nThese expenditures included health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs such as copays, deductibles, hospital stays, doctor's office visits, emergency services and home health care services. We compared these costs over the three years before the ACA's implementation, 2011 to 2013, and the seven years after, 2014 to 2020.\n\nWe excluded people 65 or older to focus on patients in the workforce. We also adjusted all costs for inflation, expressing them in 2020 dollars, and took steps to not let insurance status changes affect our results.\n\nTreatment costs for the more than 16 million Americans who were 18 to 64 and had cancer from 2011 to 2020 varied based on their income.\n\nFor those eligible for Medicaid, spending fell by about 31% from an average of $4,000 annually in 2014 to $2,750 in 2020.\n\nCancer patients with at least $51,040 in annual income spent an average of $13,000 annually on health care costs before the ACA's implementation. Their costs increased by up 24%, an average of $3,120, by 2020.\n\nThese people were also more than twice as likely after the ACA's rollout as before it to spend a large part of their income on health care - making it hard for them to afford other basics such as food and housing.\n\nCancer treatment costs for people with annual incomes ranging from about $17,600 to $51,000 declined somewhat but not significantly.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nAbout 1.9 million Americans are diagnosed with cancer annually. Treatment costs rose to nearly $210 billion in 2020, up 20% from 2015 levels.\n\nWhat patients pay varies, based largely on whether they have insurance coverage and what kind it is. Costs for cancer patients also vary based on their treatments and how well they tolerate them. The costs of drugs, doctors appointments and hospital services range widely.\n\nSome patients spend so much on cancer care that they struggle to pay their bills, a situation known as \"financial toxicity.\" Many cancer survivors owe debts they can't repay and even lose their homes. It's common for people who have had cancer to avoid filling prescriptions or getting treatment to curb their spending - endangering their health.\n\nWhat's next\n\nNew cancer treatments are promising, but many of them are very expensive. In 2022, the average yearly cost of cancer treatments reached $260,000 per patient, compared with $63,500 10 years earlier.\n\nHowever, not all cancer patients are benefiting from these medical advances. So my research team is now working on creating predictive models to help health care providers match patients to the treatments that they're most likely to respond well to.\n\nOur primary focus will be on immune checkpoint inhibitors, a newer kind of cancer treatment that helps a patient's immune system do a better job of attacking cancer cells.\n\nThe Research Brief is a short take about interesting academic work.", "source": {"uri": "theconversation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Conversation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_Care_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Affordable Care Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medicaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_lower_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American lower class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-pocket_expense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Out-of-pocket expense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copayment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copayment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductible", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deductible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skin cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Houston", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Houston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_of_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Treatment of cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_professional", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health professional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "History of medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toxicity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient_Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images.theconversation.com/files/607375/original/file-20240716-17-3uehpr.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=204%2C122%2C5259%2C2572&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758044", "eventUri": "eng-9758044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

That marks a potential 43.6% increase in the number of cancer survivors from 2022 to 2040.\n\nNearly half (48%) of the 18.1 million cancer survivors have lived more than 10 years since their diagnosis, with 19% living more than 20 years after diagnosis.\n\nResearchers said the data supports prioritizing research into oncology's preparedness to care for the growing older adult cancer survivor population as well as the need to address cancer patient caregiver needs.", "source": {"uri": "beckershospitalreview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hospital Review"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elizabeth_gregerson@beckershospitalreview.com", "name": "Elizabeth Gregerson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cancer_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Cancer Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_survivor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cancer survivor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance,_Epidemiology,_and_End_Results", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Health_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Center for Health Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prevalence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caregiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oncology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Research", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Organizations/Grant-Making_Foundations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Organizations/Grant-Making Foundations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 89}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758044", "eventUri": "eng-9758044", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 189, "textEnd": 196}], "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

As per a 2019 study in the Journal of Global Oncology, there are instances of recurrences where 30% of the patients develop metastasis during their follow-up care.However, there are cases where at the time of first diagnosis, the cancer has already metastasized and spread to other parts of the body, i.e., the cancer is already at stage IV. This happens in approximately 6% of metastatic breast cancer cases, according to a 2023 study in the Frontiers of Oncology Journal.\n\nWhen faced with a metastatic breast cancer diagnosis, patients and healthcare providers (HCPs) encounter a wide range of treatment options. While the primary objective is often to limit the cancer's progression, it is equally crucial to focus on overall survivorship. This involves not only extending life but also enhancing its quality. Adopting this holistic approach ensures that the treatment choices made today contribute to a future where patients can experience a better quality of life.\n\nWhat Is Overall Survivorship and Why It Matters When Choosing Your Breast Cancer Treatment?\n\nSurvivorship is not just about extending life; it's also about making sure that the extended life is fulfilling. Selecting the right treatment for metastatic breast cancer involves more than assessing immediate effectiveness. Patients and doctor need to consider the long-term value of treatment options. Key questions to consider include: How will this treatment affect my daily life?; What are the potential side effects?; Will it allow me to maintain my physical and emotional well-being?; Will I be able to see my children finish school?; Will I be able to get married?; or Will I be fulfil my goals?\n\nTreatments should aim to minimize adverse effects that can diminish a patient's quality of life, such as managing pain, fatigue, and emotional distress, which are common among cancer patients. Advancements in medical research have introduced various treatment options beyond traditional therapies. These include advanced targeted therapies, immunotherapies, hormonal therapies and personalized medicine, which can offer better outcomes with fewer side effects.\n\nFor example, advanced adjuvant therapies have become increasingly viable. This type of therapy is designed to target cancer cells specifically and block their replication, preventing the formation of new cancer cells. By targeting specific molecular or genetic alterations, advanced therapy can disrupt the signaling pathways essential for cancer cell growth and spread reducing the risk of recurrence compared to chemotherapy alone. Exploring these options allows patients to make informed decisions that align with their long-term health goals.\n\nStudies in the Journal of the Psychological, Social, and Behavioral of Cancer (2019) and Cancer Control (2023), have shown that patients who focus on both survival and quality of life (QoL) tend to have better overall outcomes. Integrating supportive care services such as nutrition counseling, physical therapy, and psychological support can significantly enhance the survivorship experience.\n\nRight Decision, Right Time\n\nMaking the right treatment decision at the right time is crucial. Early intervention with the most effective treatment can lead to better outcomes. However, it is also important to reassess treatment plans regularly and adjust them as needed. This adaptive approach ensures that the treatment remains aligned with the patient's evolving health status and personal preferences.\n\nOverall Survival and Quality of Life is Key\n\nWhile reducing the spread of cancer is essential, the ultimate goals of breast cancer treatment should be overall survival and quality of life.. Achieving these goals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the physical, emotional, and social aspects of living with and beyond cancer. Research supports that focusing on overall survivorship can lead to improved health outcomes and patient satisfaction. By prioritizing treatments that offer long-term benefits and considers the patient's holistic well-being, we can transform the overall cancer care experience.\n\n(Dr Ashish Joshi MD, DM, Senior Consultant Medical Oncologist, Director and Co-founder, Mumbai Onco-care Centre (MOC), Mumbai)", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastatic_breast_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metastatic breast cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer staging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metastasis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Breast cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oncology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymph_node", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lymph node"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fatigue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adjuvant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Targeted therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personalized medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cardiovascular_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cardiovascular Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111987141,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1019537,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758044", "eventUri": "eng-9758044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

These advances are made possible through seamless collaboration between MD Anderson's world-leading clinicians and scientists, bringing discoveries from the lab to the clinic and back.\n\nRecent developments at MD Anderson include low-dose radiation for B-cell lymphoma, a target for overcoming treatment resistance in pancreatic cancer, decreased public trust in U.S. health agencies providing cancer information, a roadmap for characterizing osteosarcoma tumors, insights into quality of life and survival for adolescent and young adult patients with cancer, a potential target for aggressive breast cancers with p53 mutations, a new understanding of ovarian cancer screening effectiveness, and improved outcomes for patients with renal medullary carcinoma.\n\nResponse-adapted radiation demonstrates strong results in indolent B-cell lymphoma\n\nWhile radiation treatment has proven effective in orbital indolent B-cell lymphomas, questions remain about the long-term impact of moderate-dosed radiation therapy as well as the potential effectiveness of low-dose treatment. Researchers, led by Chelsea Pinnix, M.D., Ph.D., published updated results from a study originally presented at the 2022 American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Annual Meeting. The data show that a novel response-adapted ultra-low dose radiation strategy successfully spared the vast majority of patients from high levels of radiation therapy and potential associated toxicities. On the study, 44 out of 50 patients (88%) had a complete response after the low-dose treatment, with just one requiring the full dose for a complete response. There were no local recurrences among the complete responders. The approach has become the standard of care at MD Anderson, and one other cancer centers have since adopted. Learn more in JAMA Oncology.\n\nTargeting myeloid cell protein overcomes pancreatic cancer immunotherapy resistance\n\nPatients with pancreatic cancer often develop resistance to immune checkpoint therapy partly due to the tumor microenvironment (TME), highlighting a need to understand underlying mechanisms. To provide insights, researchers led by Swetha Anandhan, Ph.D., and Padmanee Sharma, M.D., Ph.D., used single-cell sequencing on both immune and non-immune parts of the TME in treatment-resistant pancreatic tumors and in treatment-sensitive melanoma tumors. The study identified a myeloid cell regulating protein, TSG-6, with higher expression in the pancreatic tumors compared to the melanoma tumors. TSG-6 was located in the same area of the TME as tumor-suppressing macrophages with TSG-6 receptors. Blocking TSG-6 in combination with immunotherapy decreased these macrophages, improving immune responses and increasing survival outcomes in vivo. The study highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting TSG-6 to enhance immunotherapy and overcome treatment resistance in patients with pancreatic cancer.

In a new study led by Sanjay Shete, Ph.D., researchers found that public trust in U.S. government health agencies providing cancer information has fallen from 77.8% in 2020 to 70.1% in 2022. The decline was especially high among specific subgroups, such as respondents aged 18-34 (82.7% in 2020 to 69.6% in 2022), those with some college education (79.9% to 68.5%), and white respondents (77.8% to 77%). Ultimately, the researchers suggest these findings have implications for cancer prevention, treatment and outcomes, given patient trust is critical to the adoption of health recommendations.

To understand how stem cells differentiate and turn into different types of cells, researchers led by Joseph Ludwig, M.D. and Danh Truong, Ph.D., used single-cell sequencing to profile over 31,000 cells from a tissue-engineered lab model, generating a roadmap of the cellular differentiation landscape of three human connective tissue types. The atlas showed that stem-like cells are linked to worse survival outcomes, highlighting its potential for characterizing osteosarcoma tumors, and identifying specific points in cell development that can be targeted for treatment. The roadmap provides a valuable resource for precision-guided medicine that accounts for each patient's unique tumor characteristics and takes the critical first step in accurately quantifying osteosarcoma differentiation and lineage.

The overall five-year survival rate for AYAs has grown significantly over the years, resulting in a growing population of cancer survivors. However, AYAs with cancer remain understudied, and data on their health-related quality of life (QoL) is lacking. In a retrospective analysis led by Michelle Hildebrandt, Ph.D., researchers analyzed the health-related QoL scores for 3,498 AYA patients treated at MD Anderson. The results showed that a patient's physical and mental health-related QoL score at the time of diagnosis was a predictor of their overall survival. Female patients had higher physical component summary scores but lower mental scores compared to male patients. Minority patients also reported lower scores than White patients. The study highlights the association between QoL scores and overall survival among AYA patients with cancer. Learn more in the Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.\n\nProtein target identified as key mediator in aggressive breast cancers with p53 mutations\n\nTP53 missense mutations correlate with aggressive breast cancer, but little is known about how they drive tumor progression and metastasis. To investigate further, researchers led by Joy McDaniel, Ph.D., and Guillermina (Gigi) Lozano, Ph.D., used lab models with two distinct mammary cell-specific TP53 missense mutations that mimic metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and breast tumors resistant to hormone therapy. The study identified that, while each of these mutations led to unique transcriptional programs in tumors, they both were driven by NR5A2 - a nuclear hormone receptor - highlighting its role as a novel key mediator of mutant p53 transcriptional rewiring. These findings provide further insights into the role of TP53 mutations in aggressive breast cancers, such as endocrine-resistant tumors and metastatic TNBC, and highlight NR5A2 as a potential new therapeutic target.

Currently, only 30% of patients are diagnosed at an early stage, and current screening approaches have not significantly reduced mortality. To understand why, researchers led by Iakovos Toumazis, Ph.D., modeled ovarian cancer progression and estimated the sojourn time - the period from when the cancer is first detected until diagnosis - and sensitivity for different screening methods using a Bayesian approach. This first-of-its kind study showed that annual screening for ovarian cancer is unlikely to be effective in reducing mortality given the short opportunity window to detect type II ovarian cancers. Multimodal screening with CA-125 testing and transvaginal ultrasound was the most sensitive method, but this approach is not sufficient in detecting early-stage ovarian cancer. These findings help to inform and further develop better screening practices for ovarian cancer. Learn more in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nSurvival outcomes have improved for patients with renal medullary carcinoma\n\nRenal medullary carcinoma (RMC) is a rare and aggressive kidney cancer often diagnosed at a late stage. Its negative prognosis is linked to RMC's lack of the SMARCB1 tumor suppressor. Researchers led by Nizar Tannir, M.D., and Pavlos Msaouel, M.D., Ph.D., analyzed the clinical characteristics and metastatic patterns of 135 patients with RMC who were treated at MD Anderson between January 2003 and December 2023. In that time period, the study showed an increase in the probability that patients with RMC would survive two years after diagnosis. This is the largest analysis of patients with RMC to date, and it gave important insights into how bench-to-bedside research efforts have improved the survival outcomes for patients with RMC.

Despite the challenges, he emerged victorious and went on to achieve unbelievable success in golf, including being named the 2021 Nevada High School Golfer of the Year and winning the Nevada 5A Regional Individual Championship three times. His resilience and determination led him to compete in the Ellie Mae Classic on the Korn Ferry Tour at just 16, a year after his diagnosis. Gilligan, now 21, is fully in remission.\n\n\"Golf helped a lot with taking my mind off things during treatment,\" Gilligan said. \"I'm thankful that I get to play golf at a high level with my friends. I'm very lucky to have survived.\"\n\n\"I am honored to partner with Livestrong in the fight to beat cancer,\" Gilligan said. \"As a cancer survivor, I have personally witnessed how Livestrong is making a difference in the lives of people affected by cancer. My goal is for our partnership to seek solutions to support quality of life for cancer patients and survivors at every step of their journey.\"\n\nCurrently, a junior at the University of Florida, Gilligan boasts a top-scoring average of 68.88 during the 2022-2023 season, earning accolades such as PING All-American and 2023 Big West Golfer of the Year. His achievements on the golf course include setting a course record at the John A. Burns Intercollegiate in 2023 with a round of 61 and winning the Patriot All-American with a score of 198 (-12), including two rounds of 65. He also won the 2024 Southern Highlands Collegiate, securing an exemption into the 2024 Shriners Children's Open, a PGA tournament.\n\n\"It's not only awareness that Ian brings, but it's hope. We believe that Ian will serve as an inspiration to young people who are in that hospital bed today,\" Suzanne Stone, Livestrong's CEO, said. \"Our partnership with Ian is part of Livestrong's focus on adolescents and young adults, who are being diagnosed with cancer at higher rates than ever before. With partners like Ian, we can provide support and solutions for everyone affected by cancer, from patients to caregivers, family, and friends.\"\n\nLivestrong has long been committed to improving the quality of life for cancer patients and survivors. The organization's statistics highlight a 30% increase in cancer diagnoses among young adults over the past 40 years, with 90,000 new cases each year. Despite this, the five-year survival rate has increased, signifying that cancer is no longer a death sentence. Livestrong's efforts extend to reducing financial burdens, such as fertility preservation costs, through partnerships and dedicated support services.\n\n\"People should know that Livestrong is focused on improving the quality of life for anyone dealing with cancer,\" Stone said. \"Our focus is to make sure that their quality of life is as high as possible and that they have the information to make informed decisions in their life.\"\n\nWith Gilligan as a partner, Livestrong continues to step into arenas where solutions have yet to be created, ensuring that cancer patients and survivors receive the support they need to thrive.\n\n\"Ian is an inspiration to the entire world that you can persevere through any situation,\" Noah Moss, Gilligan's agent, said.", "source": {"uri": "sierrasun.com",

participate in global cancer trials.\n\nFor Singaporeans, it could mean access to new cancer drugs being tested, while the network will gain access to a diverse pool of Asian trial participants.\n\nThe immunotherapy Centers Of Research Excellence (imCore) network is a global alliance of scientific and clinical experts in cancer immunotherapy, led by Swiss healthcare company Roche and its subsidiary, biotechnology firm Genentech.\n\nOn July 24, the Singapore Translational Cancer Consortium (STCC) became its 27th member, joining groups such as Johns Hopkins Medicine in the United States, the Asan Medical Centre in South Korea and Germany's University Hospital Essen.\n\n\"Singaporean patients will have access to the very latest types of pharmaceuticals that we're developing,\" said Dr Ira Mellman, vice-president of cancer immunology at Genentech, which is based in the United States.\n\nImCore was launched in 2016, with Roche investing more than $150 million in cancer immunotherapy research at the time.\n\nAmong its contributions is helping to fund the development of a pancreatic cancer vaccine candidate that is currently in a Phase II trial.\n\nSTCC comprises five public healthcare and research institutions - the National Cancer Centre Singapore, National University Cancer Institute, Singapore, National University Hospital, National University of Singapore and Tan Tock Seng Hospital.\n\nIt was set up in 2020 to coordinate Singapore's cancer research capabilities at a national level.\n\nSTCC is the first South-east Asian member of imCore, as well as the first consortium to join the network.\n\nA memorandum of understanding between STCC and Roche was signed on July 24 at the office of government-owned tech investor SGInnovate in Carpenter Street.\n\nImmunotherapy is a treatment that harnesses the body's own immune system to fight cancer.\n\nSTCC executive director Chng Wee Joo said access to new drugs under clinical trial will allow researchers to better identify new biomarkers, which are a measure of the presence or progress of disease, or the effects of treatment.\n\nIn the longer term, this could also lead to a reduction in healthcare treatment costs for patients here, as treatments can be more accurately prescribed for suitable patients, Professor Chng told reporters.\n\nSingapore's membership in the international network will also help raise the country's visibility in the fields of science and medicine, he said, noting that Singapore's ethnic diversity - representing some 80 per cent of Asia's ethnic groups - could also help benefit global cancer research.", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zhaki_abdullah@straitstimes.com",

(July 22, 2024) - Cancer affects the world's top athletes, forcing some Olympians to compete against disease. Athletes in Paris who've contended with cancer include American cross-country skier Kikkan Randall and Canadian snowboarder Max Parrot, among others. Three experts at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, part of the University Miami Health System, explain what it takes to become a peak performer and conquer cancer. The games begin July 26.\n\n>>>\n\nLaShae Rolle is a 27-year-old UM Miller School of Medicine doctoral student and powerlifter who has competed in Olympic prequalifying tournaments in basketball. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in February and underwent a single mastectomy at Sylvester. While not an Olympian, she powers through chemotherapy by pumping iron and aspiring to compete internationally. She shares her story on Instagram.\n\n\"It's about you competing against you. Your body can do amazing things, so an athlete pushes through, it's how you complete. Athletes have an upper hand over the general cancer population because they have that kind of mentality. Athletes learned how to push past pain and discomfort before cancer, so you use those skills to push through. Exercise is my form of medicine,\" Rolle said.\n\nDocs and jocks seemingly have little in common, but Ricardo Komotar, M.D., a neurosurgeon and co-director of the Sylvester Brain Tumor Institute, says both endeavors involve rigorous preparation, competition and determination. A former college baseball player, he sees parallels between cancer survivors, physicians and athletes striving for optimal performance.\n\n\"Battling cancer requires a level of performance like an Olympian. Survivors use the same skills as athletes - discipline and regimen - to overcome cancer,\" Komotar said.\n\nPhysical fitness is a big part of Sylvester's comprehensive approach to cancer survivorship, said Paola Rossi, M.D., clinical program director of lifestyle medicine at Sylvester. The Believe in You program trains cancer survivors to participate in long-distance cycling, walking and running at the annual Dolphins Cancer Challenge event in Miami.\n\n\"We treat the whole body, not just the cancer, with a holistic approach to physical, psychological and spiritual fitness. We support all aspects of life for long-term survivorship; it's unique here and we do this really well,\" Rossi said.", "source": {"uri": "d.newswise.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "d.newswise.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Parrot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Parrot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-country_skiing_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cross-country skiing (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kikkan_Randall", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kikkan Randall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_M._Miller_School_of_Medicine", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leonard M.

The list is compiled via data from four sources: a nationwide online survey of oncology professionals, hospital quality metrics, results from patient experience surveys and a consideration of whether the hospitals use patient-reported questionnaires (called PROMs) to optimize care.\n\nAfter analysis, the top 200 leading hospitals in oncology were ranked.\n\nWhile a diagnosis of a serious illness is alarming, having access to the country's best cancer treatment facilities offers hope. This ranking aims to highlight the hospitals best equipped to provide a healthy, happy outcome.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statista", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statista"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_of_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Treatment of cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questionnaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Questionnaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oncology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient_Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Patient_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Patient Safety", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2430582/usa-specialized-hospitals-cancer-01.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=f55e90e70139d41cd899b92c4bbdc340", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758044", "eventUri": "eng-9758044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

I'm Dr Maurie Markman, from City of Hope. I look forward to presenting this very interesting paper that appeared in BMC Cancer, \"Health-Related Risk Behaviors Among US Childhood Cancer Survivors: A Nationwide Estimate.\"\n\nIt's really quite an interesting topic. I think we all know that one of the great success stories in cancer management has been the ability to effectively treat childhood cancer. Obviously, the major story there is childhood leukemia.\n\nProbably less well discussed is what happens after the cancer has been cured. Obviously, the child will grow into an adult. What about the long-term outcomes? Of course, there have been studies that have looked at questions of morbidity, and even early mortality, related to the treatments.\n\nThis particular analysis looked at risk behaviors. Basically, behavioral risk factor surveillance was done, looking at 372 individuals who were long-term survivors of childhood cancers, compared with 1100 healthy controls who were matched for age, sex, residency -- where they lived -- race, and ethnicity.\n\nThere were very interesting outcomes. First, they looked at the risk of binge drinking, which was very similar between the two groups. However, they found that the childhood cancer survivors had a much higher -- in my opinion, disturbingly higher -- risk of being smokers, at 26.6% compared with the healthy control population, as they defined it, at 14.4%. In other words, 1 in 4 of these individuals who were survivors of childhood cancer were smoking.\n\nObviously, the potential risk for other cancers is real, and maybe even higher because of their prior treatments. Also, it was noted that physical inactivity was higher, at 23.7% vs 17.7%. In fact, if one looked at two or three risk factors in this population, it was 17.2% vs 8.1% in the healthy control population. Individuals who had multiple chronic conditions, which may actually have been related to their cancer or its treatment, had a much higher risk of risky behavior.\n\nClearly, this is a very complex topic but one that cannot be ignored. When one looks at the question of whether there is something we can do to prevent these risk factors, smoking is at the top of the list. It's a very interesting paper with a very interesting analysis. Clearly, this is not the end of the story.\n\nI want to emphasize just how important it is to understand what happens to the long-term survivors of childhood cancer. There have been incredible successes and it's incredibly important what we've been able to accomplish as a cancer community, but we also have to look at what happens to these individuals when they leave the confines of the treatment area and become long-term survivors. That cannot be forgotten.\n\nThank you for your attention. I encourage you to look at this paper and consider the issues that it raises.", "source": {"uri": "medscape.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medscape"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Childhood cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Hope_National_Medical_Center", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "City of Hope National Medical Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_leukemia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Childhood leukemia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioMed_Central", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BioMed Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethnicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binge_drinking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Binge drinking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residency_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Residency (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimorbidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multimorbidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedentary_lifestyle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sedentary lifestyle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Baldness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Baldness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://img.medscapestatic.com/vim/live/professional_assets/medscape/images/thumbnail_library/C48831607_NF-ONC-Markman-vlog1-ChildhoodCancer_thumb_VIM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758044", "eventUri": "eng-9758044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

These advances are made possible through seamless collaboration between MD Anderson's world-leading clinicians and scientists, bringing discoveries from the lab to the clinic and back.\n\nRecent developments at MD Anderson include low-dose radiation for B-cell lymphoma, a target for overcoming treatment resistance in pancreatic cancer, decreased public trust in U.S. health agencies providing cancer information, a roadmap for characterizing osteosarcoma tumors, insights into quality of life and survival for adolescent and young adult patients with cancer, a potential target for aggressive breast cancers with p53 mutations, a new understanding of ovarian cancer screening effectiveness, and improved outcomes for patients with renal medullary carcinoma.\n\nResponse-adapted radiation demonstrates strong results in indolent B-cell lymphoma\n\nWhile radiation treatment has proven effective in orbital indolent B-cell lymphomas, questions remain about the long-term impact of moderate-dosed radiation therapy as well as the potential effectiveness of low-dose treatment. Researchers, led by Chelsea Pinnix, M.D., Ph.D., published updated results from a study originally presented at the 2022 American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Annual Meeting. The data show that a novel response-adapted ultra-low dose radiation strategy successfully spared the vast majority of patients from high levels of radiation therapy and potential associated toxicities. On the study, 44 out of 50 patients (88%) had a complete response after the low-dose treatment, with just one requiring the full dose for a complete response. There were no local recurrences among the complete responders. The approach has become the standard of care at MD Anderson, and one other cancer centers have since adopted.

To provide insights, researchers led by Swetha Anandhan, Ph.D., and Padmanee Sharma, M.D., Ph.D., used single-cell sequencing on both immune and non-immune parts of the TME in treatment-resistant pancreatic tumors and in treatment-sensitive melanoma tumors. The study identified a myeloid cell regulating protein, TSG-6, with higher expression in the pancreatic tumors compared to the melanoma tumors. TSG-6 was located in the same area of the TME as tumor-suppressing macrophages with TSG-6 receptors. Blocking TSG-6 in combination with immunotherapy decreased these macrophages, improving immune responses and increasing survival outcomes in vivo. The study highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting TSG-6 to enhance immunotherapy and overcome treatment resistance in patients with pancreatic cancer.

In a new study led by Sanjay Shete, Ph.D., researchers found that public trust in U.S. government health agencies providing cancer information has fallen from 77.8% in 2020 to 70.1% in 2022. The decline was especially high among specific subgroups, such as respondents aged 18-34 (82.7% in 2020 to 69.6% in 2022), those with some college education (79.9% to 68.5%), and white respondents (77.8% to 77%). Ultimately, the researchers suggest these findings have implications for cancer prevention, treatment and outcomes, given patient trust is critical to the adoption of health recommendations.

To understand how stem cells differentiate and turn into different types of cells, researchers led by Joseph Ludwig, M.D. and Danh Truong, Ph.D., used single-cell sequencing to profile over 31,000 cells from a tissue-engineered lab model, generating a roadmap of the cellular differentiation landscape of three human connective tissue types. The atlas showed that stem-like cells are linked to worse survival outcomes, highlighting its potential for characterizing osteosarcoma tumors, and identifying specific points in cell development that can be targeted for treatment. The roadmap provides a valuable resource for precision-guided medicine that accounts for each patient's unique tumor characteristics and takes the critical first step in accurately quantifying osteosarcoma differentiation and lineage.

The overall five-year survival rate for AYAs has grown significantly over the years, resulting in a growing population of cancer survivors. However, AYAs with cancer remain understudied, and data on their health-related quality of life (QoL) is lacking. In a retrospective analysis led by Michelle Hildebrandt, Ph.D., researchers analyzed the health-related QoL scores for 3,498 AYA patients treated at MD Anderson. The results showed that a patient's physical and mental health-related QoL score at the time of diagnosis was a predictor of their overall survival. Female patients had higher physical component summary scores but lower mental scores compared to male patients. Minority patients also reported lower scores than White patients. The study highlights the association between QoL scores and overall survival among AYA patients with cancer.

To investigate further, researchers led by Joy McDaniel, Ph.D., and Guillermina (Gigi) Lozano, Ph.D., used lab models with two distinct mammary cell-specific TP53 missense mutations that mimic metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and breast tumors resistant to hormone therapy. The study identified that, while each of these mutations led to unique transcriptional programs in tumors, they both were driven by NR5A2 - a nuclear hormone receptor - highlighting its role as a novel key mediator of mutant p53 transcriptional rewiring. These findings provide further insights into the role of TP53 mutations in aggressive breast cancers, such as endocrine-resistant tumors and metastatic TNBC, and highlight NR5A2 as a potential new therapeutic target.

Currently, only 30% of patients are diagnosed at an early stage, and current screening approaches have not significantly reduced mortality. To understand why, researchers led by Iakovos Toumazis, Ph.D., modeled ovarian cancer progression and estimated the sojourn time - the period from when the cancer is first detected until diagnosis - and sensitivity for different screening methods using a Bayesian approach. This first-of-its kind study showed that annual screening for ovarian cancer is unlikely to be effective in reducing mortality given the short opportunity window to detect type II ovarian cancers. Multimodal screening with CA-125 testing and transvaginal ultrasound was the most sensitive method, but this approach is not sufficient in detecting early-stage ovarian cancer. These findings help to inform and further develop better screening practices for ovarian cancer. Learn more in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nSurvival outcomes have improved for patients with renal medullary carcinoma\n\nRenal medullary carcinoma (RMC) is a rare and aggressive kidney cancer often diagnosed at a late stage. Its negative prognosis is linked to RMC's lack of the SMARCB1 tumor suppressor. Researchers led by Nizar Tannir, M.D., and Pavlos Msaouel, M.D., Ph.D., analyzed the clinical characteristics and metastatic patterns of 135 patients with RMC who were treated at MD Anderson between January 2003 and December 2023. In that time period, the study showed an increase in the probability that patients with RMC would survive two years after diagnosis. This is the largest analysis of patients with RMC to date, and it gave important insights into how bench-to-bedside research efforts have improved the survival outcomes for patients with RMC.

Brendan Shanahan's case to stay has never been weaker", "body": "In firing Sheldon Keefe as head coach on Thursday morning, the Toronto Maple Leafs made it clear that winning one round in five postseasons isn't good enough.\n\nWhich is fair enough. But now the attention will almost certainly turn to the person at the top of the organization, team president Brendan Shanahan, who has been around twice as long - 10 seasons - and has just that one playoff-round victory himself.\n\nFor a decade, Shanahan has kept himself above the fray. Even now, with new MLSE president Keith Pelley in place and set to speak to the media on Friday morning, he appears to have job security.\n\nWhile the team has yet to confirm Shanahan will remain as president, the fact Keefe has been fired and Shanahan will appear at that press conference alongside Pelley and GM Brad Treliving suggests he's not going anywhere.\n\nThe case for sticking with him and his vision has never been weaker.\n\nIt's almost unheard of for an executive in pro sports to get this long of a run with so little success in the postseason, all while clinging to an unorthodox roster construction that has backfired again and again.\n\nThe team that eliminated the Leafs in the first round last week hired their president, Cam Neely, four years before Shanahan was brought in by Tim Leiweke to run the Leafs. During Neely's tenure, the Bruins have been to the Stanley Cup Final three times and won one championship. They've also won 15 playoff rounds (and counting) in that time.\n\nIn Toronto, accountability has come for everyone but the person running the show and the core group of five players he has endorsed and defended for years.\n\nAt head coach, the team has cycled through Randy Carlyle, Peter Horachek, Mike Babcock, and now, Keefe during the Shanahan era. And while it's true that Shanahan didn't hire Carlyle, he did extend his contract soon after taking over in the spring of 2014 not long after the team had nosedived under Carlyle's watch.\n\nA lot of coaches over his tenure? No. But the sequencing of hires was unusual and bound to cause disruption.\n\nShanahan, most notably, signed Babcock to an eight-year contract before he hired a replacement for GM Dave Nonis. Shanahan liked to say that he wasn't afraid to buck convention that way, but doing so meant that Lou Lamoriello, Nonis' eventual replacement, and Kyle Dubas, Lamoriello's successor, were tied to a coach on a long-term deal they had no hand in hiring.\n\nIt didn't work. Dubas fired Babcock months into his second season as GM and replaced him with Keefe, a midseason shakeup that led to a play-in-round elimination against the Columbus Blue Jackets.\n\nEven the bridge from Lamoriello to Dubas was awkward.\n\nLamoriello ran the show for three seasons before he was replaced with Dubas, a young, rookie GM who quickly began to undo some of his predecessor's biggest moves, including a seven-year contract to defenceman Nikita Zaitsev (dealt to Ottawa at the cost of Connor Brown) and pricey commitment to Patrick Marleau (dealt to Carolina at the cost of a first-round pick that ended up being 13th overall).\n\nDubas' inexperience showed in the player-friendly second contracts Auston Matthews and Mitch Marner won from the team. William Nylander's second deal proved to be a win in the end for the Leafs, but came at the cost of the longest contract dispute in the salary cap era - and a lost 2018-19 season for Nylander.\n\nShanahan inherited Nonis as GM but also waited a full season (and a disastrous one at that) to fire him. Treliving is the fourth full-time GM of his tenure, but the fifth if you include the summer that Dubas and Mark Hunter shared the duties in an interim capacity.\n\nThe most problematic aspect of Shanahan's vision, however, has been his unwillingness to tweak the (Shana)plan when playoff results demanded it. An unwavering faith in the five-pack of Matthews, Marner, Nylander, John Tavares and Morgan Rielly helped the Leafs pile up wins in the regular season but backfired when that star power didn't shine through when it mattered.\n\n\"Those are very unique players and hard players to get,\" Shanahan said after the 2021 playoffs, which saw the Leafs blow a 3-1 series lead to heavy underdog Montreal. \"You just can't quit on these guys. You just can't quit on players that care so much - and they do.\"\n\nShanahan deserves credit for turning around the Leafs and restoring prestige to the franchise off the ice. The Leafs were one of the league's weakest franchises when he took over, having missed the playoffs in eight of their previous nine seasons. The two best regular seasons in franchise history have since come under his watch.\n\nBut ultimately that's not what Shanahan was hired for. He was hired to erase a now 57-year Stanley Cup drought.\n\nThe Leafs haven't gotten anywhere close to that goal.\n\nMoving on from another coach can't be the one big move for his team this offseason, not after another failure with this core group.\n\nIn addition to changing coaches, trading Marner (if he even agrees to a trade) could be part of a bigger solution. But the needs for the roster are significant. The blue line requires major repairs. Another quality goaltender is needed for at least tandem duty with Joseph Woll. Centre ice might be an even bigger need now than it was before as Tavares heads into his 16th NHL season.\n\nThis front office needs to get a lot right after a year of misfires.\n\nThat said, Keefe got as much of an opportunity as he could have hoped for with the Leafs. His teams never could translate the bountiful offence they generated in the regular season into the playoffs. Special teams were an ongoing issue. And with the odd exception, his Leaf teams came up small in the biggest moments. A case for change could have been made after any one of the previous four postseason letdowns, including last spring when the Leafs finally won a round before falling flat to Florida in five games.\n\nWere those failures tied to coaching or personnel? Or both?\n\nHad management altered the roster in a more meaningful and productive way last offseason, perhaps swapping Marner (before his no-move clause kicked in) for a different type of high-impact forward or a legitimate top-four defenceman, might the Leafs have fared differently this past spring? Would they have advanced deeper in the postseason with more impactful additions at the trade deadline?\n\nWe'll never know.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Treliving and Shanahan will get Keefe's replacement behind the bench right.\n\nWhen Treliving took over the Calgary Flames in 2014, he held onto the incumbent Bob Hartley for two seasons. He replaced him with Glen Gulutzan, who was dropped after two seasons and replaced by Bill Peters, who for lasted one and change. Then came Geoff Ward and Darryl Sutter.\n\nIt was an unsuccessful revolving door behind the bench.\n\nTypically, teams look for opposites when they change coaches. So will the Leafs, a team of finesse under Keefe, lean into a more blue-collar identity? Will that be a good thing? Will it work with the talent currently in place?\n\nThere was legitimate reason to move on from Keefe on Thursday. He had five cracks to take the Leafs deep into the postseason and failed to do so.\n\nBut if that's the rationale for pivoting from the coach, the question remains: Should the president of the team, who has been here twice as long, be secure?", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonas_siegel@theathletic.com", "name": "Jonas

NHL insider Elliotte Friedman, speaking on The Jeff Marek Show, leans towards Shanahan staying with the team for another year.\n\nThis speculation arises against the backdrop of the Leafs' recent playoff disappointments, notably their failure to advance past the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs since 2004 only once in 2023.\n\n\"I'm leaning towards Shanahan staying for another year. That's the impression I'm getting... He's got one more year on his contract and as it stands right now, he's going to be there to finish it out,\" Elliotte Friedman said.\n\nShanahan, who has been in charge for a decade but has overseen only one playoff-round victory, faces heightened scrutiny due to the team's postseason struggles. The decision to let go of Keefe shows that the Leafs want a change of scenery as they have been patient with this management for quite a long.\n\nWhile rumors swirl about Shanahan's future, his participation in upcoming press conferences alongside newly appointed MLSE president Keith Pelley and GM Brad Treliving hints at him retaining his role.\n\nMaple Leafs GM Brad Treliving and Sheldon Keefe's statements\n\nGeneral Manager Brad Treliving highlighted the difficulty of the decision as Sheldon Keefe's termination from the Toronto Maple Leafs' coach marked a significant development.\n\n\"Today's decision was difficult,\" Treliving said. \"Sheldon is an excellent coach and a great man; however, we determined a new voice is needed to help the team push through to reach our ultimate goal. We thank Sheldon for his hard work and dedication to the organization over the last nine years, and wish him and his family all the very best.\"\n\nThe Maple Leafs' recent postseason struggles, scoring more than two goals in just one of their last 14 playoff games and struggling on the power play during crucial moments, were pivotal in Keefe's dismissal.\n\nKeefe shared a video message and took full responsibility for the Toronto Maple Leafs's playoff failures. He said:\n\n\"I didn't get it done in the playoffs, I didn't help push our team over the line and deliver. I accept responsibility for that. No excuses. That's the job, I didn't get it done.\"\n\n\"It's the reality of the business and I accept it. To the players, I appreciate all your efforts. Your talents, your work ethic made me look good on a lot of nights,\" Keefe said.\n\nWith a sudden end to his contract, Keefe said that he is ready to face the future and doesn't know what to do next with him wanting to take some time with his family.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abhilasha_aditi@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Abhilasha Aditi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Keefe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheldon Keefe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Shanahan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brendan Shanahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliotte_Friedman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elliotte Friedman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Treliving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brad Treliving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_Leaf_Sports_&_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Sweeteners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Sweeteners", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Essays", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Essays", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Predictions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Predictions", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/20800745-1715283132.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551468", "eventUri": "eng-9551468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

He lasted another year, but after that day, he never mattered again.\n\nIt was an instructive display of how power works at the peak of professional sports. It isn't just what they say. It's who shows up, and how they look, and where everyone is sitting and when they make eye contact.\n\nIt's been ages since MLSE gathered the whole king's court in public for one of these brutal shows. It is about to do another.\n\nInitially, the Leafs were going to do things the way they usually do them after another season off the brink. The players would talk one day, and management another. That's how the club put it in a release - \"management.\"\n\nThe first twist - head coach Sheldon Keefe was lumped in with the players. As Nonis once had, he made his case to stay. He also said he was told he could choose to do exit interviews with his players, or not bother. He didn't bother.\n\nIt's never good when they hate you. But it's when they stop caring at all that you really need to worry.\n\nManagement was set for Thursday. That was changed to Friday - and now MLSE CEO Keith Pelley would join Shanahan and GM Brad Treliving on the podium.\n\nUntil recently, overseeing the Leafs was a bumpless road for Shanahan. Leiweke's protection extended until long after the CEO job had been inherited by a paper man. Shanahan could walk around 50 Bay St. like a Borgia cardinal - his power literally residing in his rings.\n\nThe Leafs were coming up, the Raptors and Toronto FC were winning, and the various stadia were full. MLSE didn't require sports oversight.\n\nThe sports are wobbling in unison, but oversight remains invisible. When Shanahan (or Raptors president Masai Ujiri) speak, you wouldn't know they reported to anyone. They talk like owners.\n\nThat's about to change.\n\nThe only thing Pelley likes better than a cat is identifying some pigeons to release it among. Before he showed up, very little news came out of MLSE. Since he's entered the picture, it's leaking like a colander.\n\nThis week, Sportsnet's Elliotte Friedman reported that MLSE was considering compacting the layers - the Leafs president job would be eliminated, and the GM would report directly to Pelley.\n\nThat idea was allowed to hang in the air for a few hours before Friedman softened it. Now the idea had been discussed, but there was no \"unanimity\" on it among ownership.\n\nBecause Bell and Rogers operate in concert when it comes to running MLSE, a lack of unanimity around any proposal means it is dead on its feet.\n\nBut the idea is out there. It's being discussed. Why do the Leafs need a president? Or the Raptors, while we're on the subject? Is overstaffing the reason Toronto's teams are beset by decision paralysis?\n\nIf you'd just gone and done it, people would call it a panic move. But now you've put it out there to marinate for a year or two. When and if it happens, it will seem like standard operating procedure.\n\nPelley is good enough at this game to be Iago and Othello at the same time - whispering in ears and unsettling old alliances, while also consolidating his own power at the top. Do the housecats who had free run at MLSE before he arrived possess the nimbleness and/or ruthlessness to combat him?\n\nWe will get our first sense of that on Friday. It seems obvious that Shanahan is coming back to fulfill the final year of his contract. Why else invite him? There wouldn't be much point in letting Treliving go after just one year. Sheldon Keefe may or may not be Leafs coach much longer, but now that the drama has been elevated to the C-suites, he's become a supporting actor.\n\nFriday's news conference comes down to one question - which man on this podium is the Dave Nonis?\n\nIf the Leafs had beaten the Bruins and then Florida, this struggle could have been put off for a bit. But when David Pastrnak scored in overtime in Game 7, he started MLSE's Game of Thrones.\n\nThe last time around, it was a total bloodletting.\n\nLeiweke arrived in 2013. Weeks later, he hired Ujiri, who nudged out his predecessor, Bryan Colangelo. Months after that, he hired Shanahan, who lit the Leafs on fire from top to bottom. Just over a year after he arrived, Leiweke announced his plan to leave, warring with ownership as he did so.\n\nIn the end, everything changed, and for the better. Eventually, inertia set in, then lassitude, and now apathy.\n\nMLSE is tired and out of ideas. Its teams reflect that lack of purpose. Even now, most of its energy is taken up trying to avoid making hard decisions.\n\nIt's obvious what people want from MLSE - change. They want a return to the giddy feeling of possibility when Leiweke first arrived. They want sport rather than excuses.\n\nIf they can't get it on the ice or the court, they'll take it in the boardroom.

There is much speculation about the potential removal of head coach Sheldon Keefe. As Maple Leafs Sports and Entertainment CEO Keith Pelley, President Brendan Shanahan, and General Manager Brad Treliving prepare for a joint press conference, the spotlight is on Keefe's future and the team's postseason struggles under his leadership.\n\nRelated: Will Ilya Samsonov Be a Maple Leaf Next Season?\n\nHowever, there's also speculation about Shanahan's future. There are some rumblings that he should not escape the axe. That said, since he's scheduled to be at the meeting, he will likely remain with the team.\n\nRegular-season success has been a hallmark of Keefe's coaching tenure. In his time at the helm, the Maple Leafs have an impressive .607 winning percentage. However, their postseason performances have been tainted by disappointment, only advancing past the first round once.\n\nTreliving's decision here is critical, considering the team's desire for postseason success. But a decision to remove him is expected because Keefe will not attend on Friday.\n\nIf Keefe is relieved of his duties, Treliving will have many coaching options to consider. While names like Craig Berube and Todd McLellan are in the spotlight, other coaches like Gerard Gallant and Jay Woodcroft are also in the mix. Joel Quenneville's name has also popped up, but he has to get NHL clearance.\n\nThe decision regarding Keefe's future will shape the Maple Leafs' course for next season. Keefe failed to guide the Maple Leafs on a successful playoff run, and the decision to remove him will likely make fans exceedingly happy in the short term. The vocal ones have been more than clear. Last year, it was Kyle Dubas, and this year, it will be Keefe.\n\nRelated: Today in Hockey History: May 8\n\nUnless there's a huge surprise, Friday's press conference is a done deal. Change is on the horizon in Toronto, and Keefe will be on his way out of town.\n\nWhat about Shanahan's future with the organization? There are questions about the rationale behind retaining him, especially considering the team's lack of playoff success under his leadership.\n\nWith Shanahan at the top of the food chain for a decade, the Maple Leafs have managed only one playoff-round win. That's a skimpy feat for a team in a city often hailed as hockey's Mecca. Despite time to develop a winning franchise, the team kept running out of gas in the postseason.\n\nIn Shanahan's time, he first brought in experienced hockey minds like GM Lou Lamoriello and head coach Mike Babcock. But neither could get the job done, and they were eventually removed. Second, he brought in newcomer Kyle Dubas as GM, who hired his old running mate in Keefe. Neither approach worked. Fans are impatient and frustrated with the long space between Stanley Cups and are questioning Shanahan's ability to steer the team in the right direction.\n\nWhen Shanahan assumed his role in 2014, the Maple Leafs were far from a powerhouse organization. He made changes that gave the team opportunities every season, and they made significant strides under his leadership. But it isn't enough. At the same time, franchises like the Vegas Golden Knights have thrived, winning numerous playoff rounds and even capturing a Stanley Cup.\n\nRelated: Criticisms of Maple Leafs' Effort Are Off-Base\n\nThe clamour for change is growing louder, and many argue that Shanahan's time with the Maple Leafs has run its course. With a single playoff series victory in a decade, is there a need for a fresh perspective? Is a new leadership structure in the works? The upcoming press conference will shed light on Shanahan's fate. However, two days before the event, logic would suggest that Shanahan stays and Keefe goes.\n\nFor many Maple Leafs fans, enough is enough. Will Keefe's leaving placate the fanbase? The answer is likely yes -- at least for this year. What happens next year is another story.\n\nGiven the mood last season when the organization decided to run it back again, it's unlikely that will happen again this season. While Keefe's future as head coach seems doubtful, Shanahan is likely to see more time as president. He'll have another chance to carry the team forward - at least one hopes it will be forward.\n\nFriday's press conference will clarify potential changes within the coaching staff and organizational structure as the Maple Leafs seek to address postseason shortcomings and reposition themselves for success.

Team president Brendan Shanahan was on the verge of bringing back general manager Kyle Dubas last spring when a late fallout led to a course change and the somewhat hurried hiring of Brad Treliving to replace Dubas.\n\nTreliving didn't have the time for a thorough coaching search and instead stuck with the guy he inherited. The logic is understandable: Why burst through the door, guns blazing, before you've even had the chance to figure out where the executive washrooms are located?\n\nBut how much more evidence was required to show that Keefe couldn't solve the riddle of the Maple Leafs' annual early exit? They lost to the Columbus Blue Jackets in the 2020 postseason - a team that hasn't made the playoffs since. They lost to the Montreal Canadiens the following year, a team that finished last in its division in each of the following three seasons. They lost in the first round in two of the following three seasons after that. Even when they did manage to win a playoff round last season in some strange twist of cosmic fate, they embarrassed themselves with a no-show against the eighth-seeded Florida Panthers.\n\nDid they have some bad injury luck and fall victim to the vagaries of knife-edge playoff hockey? Sure. Run into some hot goalies? Yep (mysteriously, the other team always seemed to have the hot goalie). But four kicks at the playoffs is a lot of kicks. Under Keefe, the Leafs were like a luxury car with a steering misalignment: expensive, looks great, but always ends up in the ditch.\n\nAnd while the epitaph for Keefe's time in the job will say that he led great regular-season teams that couldn't get it done in the playoffs, even that is a bit of a stretch. For all of Toronto's high-end talent, the Leafs managed just two second-place finishes and two third-place finishes in the Atlantic Division during Keefe's tenure. (They won the all-Canadian division in the COVID season, then promptly had their most embarrassing playoff loss.) The Leafs always looked a notch below Boston, Tampa Bay, or both, and this year it was Florida's turn to look like a more complete team.\n\nThat's where the path forward gets tricky: Keefe wasn't able to solve the Leafs, and they will remain a conundrum for the next guy. They have top-end talent that should form the core of a championship contender, but Dubas and now Treliving have been unable to find the right mix of players around them to either provide the scoring depth that's required at playoff time, or perform all the necessary greasy work that would allow the star forwards to cut loose like they might do on a random February night.\n\nThat bit about how the Leafs pay their Core Four so much that it makes roster-building a real challenge? It's not just the ramblings of the internet masses or a tired trope of talk radio. It's a fact. This season, the Leafs spent 48.5% of their salary cap on their top four forwards - Auston Matthews, John Tavares, Mitch Marner, and William Nylander - according to CapFriendly. The Avalanche dedicate 44.3% to their top four, made up of three forwards and a defenseman. The Oilers pay 43.5% to their top four, also three forwards and a defender. The Bruins spend 40% on their top four, two forwards and two defensemen. You see the pattern here. The New York Rangers are closest to Toronto with 45.1% of the cap allotted to four guys, but they include two forwards and two defenders.\n\nThose extra percentage points of cap room that other teams have beyond their top four players mean they can sprinkle a few million dollars elsewhere, which might have spared the Leafs from the constant churn at the lower end of the roster.\n\nCap constraints mean Treliving will likely end up trying to do the same things he did last summer: picking up veterans on relatively cheap deals, betting that some young and unheralded players can become reliable depth guys, and desperately hoping that the team doesn't enter another April while still trying to identify its No. 1 goaltender.\n\nWhen Shanahan, Treliving, and new MLSE boss Keith Pelley meet the Toronto media on Friday, they are sure to be asked if more substantial changes will be made.

Well Jeff, one thing we know now is that Keefe and the players are talking on Monday and management isn't talking until . So we might not know about Keefe, by then.\n\nHonestly. I think Keefe is a better coach than the market gives him credit for. I wouldn't be surprised at all if Keith ends up going somewhere else and proving his critics in Toronto wrong. I think he did a good job in very difficult circumstances this year with all the injuries and everything.\n\nAnd this is one and we'll bookmark it. In three or four years we could all come back and look at this and say Elliotte was right, or Elliotte was wrong. And if I'm wrong, I'm sure I'm gonna hear it, but it would not surprise me at the least if he goes somewhere else and does really well.\n\nBut look, I do think the Maple Leafs are gonna look at what else is out there. You'll remember going back last summer, before they committed to keep and extended him, they definitely discussed alternatives. Like if we don't bring him back, or we don't extend him, who makes sense? Who would we bring in?

This is going to be Keith Pelley's decision. And for me, the only question here is, how much time does Pelley need to make the call? Is he keeping him or is he moving on?\n\nAnd Pelley has been quiet. He has done everything he can to prevent himself from being the story. And that's the question I have. What is his timetable for making this decision?\n\nNow, in addition to that timetable, I had someone say to me, 'well, if they remove Shanahan who replaces him?'\n\nHonestly, I'm not sure that's the question to ask because I'm not convinced anymore that ownership wants that kind of layer of management.

I sure did. Nothing quite like being reminded over and over, by just about every player on the team, that they're \"close.\" Always close, with these guys. Close to winning something, close to each other, close to making you throw your remote through the TV screen. So close!\n\nThis year, we got a memorable bonus quote from the current whipping boy, who decided this would be a good week to compare the players to deities. He's not even wrong. The Toronto Maple Leafs players really are gods, in their own way. Then again, so was Oizys.\n\nFor the record, I don't think Marner's \"gods\" quote was especially controversial; I think we can all appreciate what he was going for, even if he might have preferred to have it come out a bit differently. And if Marner's soundbite was a bit awkward, at least it fit with a larger trend in Leafs land, where the team has spent the last few years leaving quote-based signposts along the road to wherever this is that they've wound up.\n\nSo today, as we wait for the implosion to truly start, let's remember 12 soundbites that this team offered up during the Brendan Shanahan era, and how they ultimately add up to explain the way it all fell apart.\n\nShanahan dropped this one about a year into his presidency, in the wake of his decision to move on from Dave Nonis as GM. At the time, it was exactly what fans wanted to hear, delivered alongside a promise that \"there are no shortcuts.\" After years of watching Nonis and others chase quick fixes while bragging that they weren't worried about year six or seven, a long-term strategy was finally in place.\n\nIn essence, this was the day that the \"Shanaplan\" was born. And hearing Shanahan lay out his vision, there was a reason for real optimism in Toronto for the first time in a generation.\n\nAnd yet, in hindsight, you can see the foreshadowing of where it will all go wrong. Like Chekhov's gun hanging on the wall in the opening scene, the eventual downfall was hidden in plain sight. Shanahan's pledge to stick to the plan felt like a long-term vision at the time; today it feels more like a threat. The last decade has been defined by the Leafs' almost fanatical resistance to the idea of significant change. This team became the poster child for running it back, a phrase that went from novel to worn to punchline. No matter what happened, no matter how disappointing the latest loss felt, Shanahan and company vowed to \"stick to it.\"\n\nIt could have worked. There's an alternate universe out there where it did work, and between sips of champagne the Core Four credit the organization for always believing in them, and bravely resisting the calls to blow it all up just before the inevitable payoff. But it never happened. The players never paid Shanahan back for his unwavering loyalty. And now, here we are.\n\nThis was the key quote from Shanahan's explanation of arguably the biggest decision he made in Toronto: Handing the GM reins to Kyle Dubas, leading to the exit of both Lou Lamoriello and Mark Hunter.\n\nWe've been litigating that decision for six years, and probably will for six more. Personally, I liked Dubas and thought this was the right call, even as it's impossible not to play \"what if?\" today. Would Lou have stuck with the plan through multiple playoff losses? Doubtful. Would his version of the team have been any better? We'll never know.\n\nThe key to this quote is the key to the Dubas decision, as Shanahan pledged his commitment to a modern view of the game, not one rooted in the past. It was a rejection of decades' worth of 200 Hockey Men wisdom, not entirely but at least as the sole basis of doing things. Under Dubas, the team would go on to spend years struggling to reconcile the old way and the new. They still are to this day.\n\nThis quote, of course, doesn't stand on its own. It goes along with that photo.\n\nAt the time, landing John Tavares felt like a massive victory for the franchise. He was a very good player, sometimes a great one, and felt like an ideal leader to guide the still-young core toward success. Maybe more importantly, he had chosen the Leafs, passing on richer offers from other teams to come home. One year after fellow hometown boy Steven Stamkos had passed on the Toronto spotlight, Tavares was embracing it.\n\nAnd yet ... six years later, some will point to this signing as the original sin that sent the team in the wrong direction. After all, Tavares took less to come to Toronto, but not much less. Even as he was living that childhood dream, he still took care of the bottom line. Those young players he was meant to lead certainly seemed to notice.\n\nShould the Leafs have passed? Again, we'll debate it forever. You can create fictional scenarios where Tavares is replaced by an elite blueliner, but nobody matching that description was available at the time. For his part, Tavares has always seemed determined to frustrate the narratives on both sides -- never quite good enough to live up to his contract, but never quite bad enough to be a clear-cut bust.\n\nOne way or another, this was the moment that locked in what would become known as the Core Four. And if there was any doubt about that, it lasted just a few days before ...\n\nProbably the most memorable quote of the era, this was Dubas a few days after signing Tavares, vowing that he'd be able to keep Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner and William Nylander too.\n\nAnd he was right. Whether it was the right choice or not, the GM called his shot. When Dubas left Toronto five years later, all four guys were still there. He could, and he did.\n\nShould he have? More specifically, did a rookie GM kneecap his own future bargaining position by staking his reputation on re-signing everyone, locking his team into one path at the expense of an open mind? Again, we'll debate it for years to come.\n\nThis was part of a larger series of comments, just as William Nylander's negotiation was dragging into the season, in which Shanahan appeared to be appealing to his core to take a little less to make sure the team could build a winner around them. He directly invoked his time in Detroit, suggesting that the willingness of that team's stars to take less money was key to their multiple Cups. The whole thing is worth a read, but maybe the closest Shanahan came to spelling it out was when he said: \"At the end of the day, we all found a way we could fit with each other so we could keep adding to the group (in Detroit) and that is obviously what we're asking some of our young leaders to do.\"\n\nThe message was clear. It was also, it's fair to say, unsuccessful. Nylander sat out until December, Marner and Matthews squeezed as hard as they could at the bargaining table, and the cap crunch was well and truly on.\n\nThe irony here is that while Shanahan clearly believed what he was saying, he and the front office would go on to apply his \"may not be for everyone\" credo to evaluating new acquisitions, but never his own core. If they ever worried that being a Maple Leaf wasn't for anyone already on the roster, they never seemed to show it.\n\nLeafs fans had barely had time to digest a $58 million extension for Auston Matthews when Marner's agent decided to weigh in with a series of eye-opening quotes in the Toronto Star. Apparently frustrated with slow progress on a Marner extension, Ferris let the Leafs have it with both barrels.\n\nOther nuggets from Ferris that day included \"So far they've been trying to lowball (Marner)\" and \"Mitch already did them a favour on the entry-level deal\", along with an ominous \"Mitch will get what Mitch is due.\"\n\nFerris tried to calm the waters somewhat in subsequent interviews, but it's fair to say that he was ultimately proven right. Marner did get what he was due, and maybe even a bit more, with no team-friendly discount to be found. Presumably, Marner's camp negotiated the deal knowing that it would significantly ratchet up the pressure on a young player in a tough market, and were willing to accept that get to a number they felt was fair. Now with that deal expiring after next season, we wait to see whether or not they get a chance to negotiate a new one with the Maple Leafs.\n\nWe've jumped ahead two more years in the timeline now, but the story hasn't changed. The Leafs have lost to the Bruins (twice), the Blue Jackets (somehow) and the Canadiens (inexcusably). And yet Dubas and Shanahan are defiantly still sticking by the core.\n\nHere, Dubas makes it clear: He's all in. And in hindsight, he was a man of his word. He did bet everything on them, and it was a bet he eventually lost.\n\nThere have been far more important quotes in the Shanahan era. There has never been a dumber one. I'm not sure there could be.\n\nAnd sure, maybe the full quote isn't quite as bad as you remember it (and even included the mostly forgotten caveat that \"We're not in the respect game, we're in the winning game.\") Still, Keefe's infamous soundbite in the aftermath of yet another Game 7 debacle, this one on home ice against the Lightning, was perplexing at the time and feels infuriating now.\n\nThe most charitable possible interpretation is that he was trying to put a positive spin on disaster. A more reasonable one is that this was pure loser talk, the sort of \"at least you tried\" bar-lowering that should have had alarm bells ringing up and down the organization.\n\nKeefe's multiyear extension kicked in a few weeks later.\n\nPoor Marner. I'm not sure there's ever been a player who seemed to want so badly to be a Maple Leafs hero, while consistently failing so utterly at it. The lingering image of this version of the team might be any one of a number of shots of Marner, looking like he was fighting back tears as another postseason went south. Say what you want about the results, he always cared.\n\nThis quote wasn't from the playoffs, coming instead from a painfully slow start to the regular season. And it also wasn't quite as I remembered it. The context makes it clear that Marner is pushing back on the idea of the team being mentally weak. He's going for a tone of defiance, not doubt.\n\nStill, the turn of phrase felt like a perfect summary of what we'd all been seeing. This team did seem fragile. They did seem to be in their own heads. And maybe it couldn't be any other way, given how suffocating the market could be. But it was there. And for a fan base looking for the right words to describe it all, \"shambles in our brain\" fit the bill.\n\nBy the way, this was the same month that saw Keefe offer some extremely mild criticism of his young stars, then almost immediately walk it back after feeling the need to explain himself to his players. And it was over a year before another memorable Marner soundbite, the one that saw him try to claim that a Leafs team on a four-game losing streak was playing \"great.\" Hey, who are we to argue with a god?\n\nThis was from the aftermath of Shanahan's decision to part ways with Dubas. It was a truly bizarre day, one that started with the surprising but hardly shocking news that Dubas was out, giving way to a Shanahan explanation that raised more questions than answers.\n\nAfter years of shunning big changes, the Leafs had finally made one -- and nobody was quite clear on why. We're still not, come to think of it, although by this point it hardly matters. Dubas was gone and eventually off to Pittsburgh, and you had strong feelings about the whole thing, one way or another.\n\nGMs get fired. It's part of life in the NHL, especially for teams that can't break through. But we don't often see them fired under these circumstances, or based on this sort of reasoning.\n\nIt led to plenty of speculation that even bigger changes would be on the way once a new GM arrived. Spoiler alert: They weren't.\n\nTreliving's most memorable soundbite so far, this one feels like a modern version of Brian Burke's old classic about truculence.\n\nIt was also music to the ears of many fans, who'd spent years screaming that the Dubas-built Leafs were too skilled and fancy to succeed in the playoffs and needed some more old-fashioned grit. It was as close as Treliving really came to publicly second-guessing the old guard, or articulating a philosophical difference.\n\nTreliving's snottier Leafs eventually faced the big bad Bruins, and lost a close series because they couldn't score. Speaking of which ...\n\nThis quote, of course, came in the aftermath of a disastrous Game 4 loss on home ice, one in which it's fair to say that many fans were not heeding Keefe's advice about what they could or couldn't question.\n\nSomehow, this wasn't even the most memorable quote of the night. Which brings us to ...\n\nWe don't know for sure that this is exactly what he said, although it sure seemed like it. We don't know if the second part about junior hockey is accurate either. We don't even know who the comments were aimed at, although everyone has their guess.\n\nWhatever was said, and whoever it was directed at, the reality may not even matter to a frustrated fan base that was probably yelling far worse at their TV screens.\n\nIn a way, you couldn't come up with a more fitting epitaph for an era that started with so much hope and ended in bitter disappointment. When the change this team has resisted for so long finally arrives, there's no point crying, bro, over what might have been. And you can quote me on that.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_mcindoe@theathletic.com", "name": "Sean McIndoe", "type":

And man, did you ever have a lot on your minds.\n\nOver 2,000 respondents chimed in on short notice, often vociferously, about everything from Leafs president Brendan Shanahan, coach Sheldon Keefe, the team's stars and the organization's future.\n\nWe know you want the results, so here they are.\n\nA tight two-horse race between giving up and already having given up: Welcome to the Maple Leafs fan experience in 2024!\n\nLook, I get it. Walking toward TD Garden on the afternoon of Game 7, I thought, \"Surely, they're going to break through one of these years and just get it done, right?\" Then I reminded myself that I said a version of that sentence to myself in 2021...and 2022.\n\nMy biggest takeaway from this survey compared to last season was how the underlying anger simmering below the surface has bubbled to the top more palpably. That people choosing \"Anger\" made up the third-most votes and beat out the optimists was telling.\n\nNow they're still the Leafs. Right now there's next to zero chance this team sees enough of a dip in attendance to make the organization believe fans may be turning on their team.\n\nBut the fan sentiment around this team, this core and this management group took a hit this season. The decision-makers aren't completely disconnected from fans and the media that bring those fan voices to a wider audience. If management is listening, they might not like what they're hearing.\n\nFans don't believe in a roster that had serious questions going into the playoffs and, I guess not surprisingly, didn't get it done when it mattered. There wasn't enough secondary scoring in the bottom six. The defenders the coaching staff had at their disposal couldn't move the puck to the team's elite scorers.\n\nThat more than a quarter of respondents argued the team's high-end forwards didn't produce enough is closely related to roster construction, too. The fans who voted in this survey have seen enough of this Leafs experiment that has lasted nearly a decade and want change. It feels more and more like they're going to get it, too.\n\nI thought the team's lacklustre goaltending might have earned more votes. But perhaps fans have been screaming the same thing I have to any colleague who will listen: There's just so few elite goalies in the NHL and the teams who have them aren't giving them up.\n\nThe majority of the votes here only drive home the need for GM Brad Treliving to get out the scalpel on the roster this summer.\n\nShanahan has done a lot of good for the Leafs organization. He's employed plenty of smart people who have made meaningful changes that don't always get seen in the wake of playoff failures.\n\nBut the results of Shanahan's tenure with the Leafs speak for themselves: One playoff series win in 10 years. Being able to say, \"We were close, we're right there\" has a shelf life. And at least according to fans, Shanahan blew past that point.\n\nWhat is revealed on Friday's end-of-season availability with Leafs management - after it was pushed back a day - should be fascinating. Will Shanahan remain in his post? Or is Keith Pelley and MLSE going in a new, unforeseen direction?\n\nNo surprise that most fans voted to have Keefe replaced. When any team in any sport doesn't experience the success they are expected to, the head coach is usually the sacrificial lamb. And Keefe himself spoke with a mix of vulnerability and pride in reflection during his end-of-season availability that would suggest he understands his Leafs tenure is on thin ice.\n\nBut what was surprising: How many fans were interested in keeping Keefe behind the bench if major surgery was made to the roster.\n\nTheoretically, Keefe might have a better chance of getting deeper in the playoffs with a true No. 1 defenceman as well as further improvements to the blue line and more offensive pop from the third and fourth lines. You'd think most coaches would, however.\n\nI didn't think Treliving did enough to adequately assess the team's weaknesses at the trade deadline. I also, for whatever it's worth, didn't think he should part with the team's first-round pick. Not doing so probably left Treliving with very few cards to play.\n\nWhat we saw from Treliving this year felt more like a GM just quietly assessing what he has at his disposal organizationally. And as such, this season was probably only the preview to what could be a main event-type of summer. So what these results look like in a year or so could look wildly different.\n\nI'm not sure which was more perplexing about the results of this question. That there were people who wanted to see the singularly most talented Leaf of all-time, Auston Matthews, move this summer -- or that fewer people wanted to see William Nylander moved than Matthews.\n\nQuite the change from a few years ago, when Nylander drew most of the ire from Leafs fans and many were scheming up ways to ship him out of town for whatever No. 1 defenceman they thought was easily acquirable.\n\nRight now, these results suggest Mitch Marner has been named to the role of the public scapegoat.\n\nMarner, you'll remember, has a history of better production than any other Leaf in the postseason since he arrived in Toronto. Points certainly don't tell the entire story of a player, so let's add that Marner's defensive acumen doesn't come along every day. Was there a lot to be desired about Marner's perceived effort levels during the postseason? For sure, and that - among other things - has brought his future with the team into question.\n\nOver two-thirds of respondents are comfortable getting a paltry return for a two-time NHL First Team All-Star and one of the best wingers in the game if it meant clearing one more season of his $10.9-million cap hit off the books.\n\nWould that mean asking for a draft pick with the intent of using that cap space in free agency? Or is it best to get roster players back? I've seen the same list of possible names you have that could come back in a return package.\n\nLet's say if Marner gets traded, (still a big \"If\" for now, by the way) it also feels like whatever the return is will become just as prominent a talking point as Marner's recent play and future with the Leafs.\n\nDeath, taxes and Leafs fans wanting that mythical top defenceman on their roster. Just as they have for every season since the beginning of the Matthews era.\n\nI'm more in line with the 18.3 percent who voted for more blue line help down the bottom of the lineup, but I have a feeling the years of the masses longing for the Victor Hedman or Roman Josi-type won't allow me to be heard.\n\nDomi sure lapped up the chance to be a Maple Leaf this season, something he said was a \"dream.\"\n\nDomi finished fifth in the NHL in 5-on-5 assists behind literally four of the best players in hockey. He stepped up after defeats to shoulder criticism from the media. Even though there were some unnecessary penalties and gaffes in his play here and there, he personified the heart and will that fans have been pining for come playoff time.\n\nIt's no surprise then that fans took a shine to Domi and want him back.\n\nSo, what would that kind of extension look like? A shorter deal with a bit of a raise on the $3-million AAV he clocked on his one-year contract this season?\n\nDomi certainly held up his end of the bargain on a \"Show me\" deal but if you're Treliving, don't you still have some questions about a player who has been on six teams over the past five seasons? Maybe, maybe not.\n\nMaybe Domi is part of the new core of players Treliving wants to build around moving forward. That would be one way to earn some optimism from a fan base that is short on it right now.\n\nMatthew Knies and Joseph Woll's impressive form during the playoffs earned them a healthy amount of the vote, and it's those people who probably agree with me that #PlayYerKids is a philosophy to live by.\n\nThen there were the dreamers among us who wanted their voice to be heard, too. The Boston Red Sox broke the Curse of the Bambino and won the 2004 World Series. I guess I just wonder if those dreamers will live to see the Leafs win the Stanley Cup, considering it took 86 years for the Red Sox to win that World Series.\n\nBut nearly 40 percent find optimism in the fact that moving forward, two of the best players in the game will stay in Toronto. You could do a lot worse when it comes to team-building than working around a true No. 1 centre and winger.\n\nSo far, the Leafs have failed to win in Matthews' and Nylander's best years. They're squarely in their prime right now. The optimism is justified this year. Let's see where we're at come the end of 2024-25.\n\nI'm not an editor, but I certainly empathized with my own benevolent editor when I asked for a one sentence reply and Leafs fans wrote back with an entire book's worth of feelings.\n\n\"The biggest joke and worst team in all of sports history.\"\n\n\"My body is blue with bruises.\"\n\n\"The Leafs have needed a Brendan Shanahan-type player but for some reason Brendan Shanahan didn't feel the same which is mind blowing.\"\n\n\"The boomers were right.\"\n\n\"I never want to hear the phrase 'Run it back' ever again.\"\n\n\"John Cleese had a quote about England's soccer team that sums the Leafs up pretty nicely: 'It's not the despair. I can take the despair. It's the hope I can't stand.'\"\n\n\"We're f -- -...but we might do it next year.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Fresh out of law school, she was 12 years his junior, with few of the qualifications that might level the power dynamic with the world's seventh-richest man. \"I thought, okay, she's fine,\" a person close to the situation told The Daily Beast. \"And then it went on.\"\n\nBy the time they married, in 2018, Shanahan had slingshotted into Silicon Valley stardom. She socialized with other billionaires' plus-ones, distributed millions to pet causes -- sometimes igniting controversy -- and worked to distance Brin from his ex-wife, 23andMe co-founder Anne Wojcicki, who had remained close with the billionaire, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the relationships.\n\nBut almost as quickly, Shanahan's marriage to Brin deteriorated. The couple squabbled over the right approach to raising their daughter, who was diagnosed with autism, and Shanahan chafed at Brin's left-brain thinking. There was also the matter of her alleged affair with Elon Musk in 2021, a betrayal so profound and astonishing that the starchy pages of The Wall Street Journal might briefly have been confused for a tabloid.\n\nOver the past year -- armed with a mountain of divorce-settlement cash -- Shanahan has found a new ally in Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the black sheep of America's most famous political dynasty, whose conspiratorial predilections have disturbed many scientific minds in Silicon Valley and often made the candidate a spectacle. (He has also made headlines for other reasons. This week, in an unexpected twist, it was revealed that he once claimed to be suffering from memory loss because a worm had crawled into his skull, eaten some of his tissue, and then died.)\n\nShanahan's relationship with Kennedy leveled up earlier this year, when her new romantic partner, Jacob Strumwasser, a Bitcoin enthusiast whom she met, naturally, at Burning Man, suggested to Kennedy that he consider Shanahan as his vice presidential nominee. Kennedy bit, and Shanahan soon assumed an even larger platform, where she wasted no time mirroring his contrarianism, warning about unproven health risks associated with \"electromagnetic pollution\" and railing against certain COVID vaccines.\n\nOn a podcast this month, she echoed conservative talking points, arguing that almost all women contemplating an abortion would choose to give birth if they were given enough resources. She also stated, without providing evidence, that demonstrations in support of Gaza on college campuses are being fueled by paid protesters.\n\nInterviews with 10 people who have been close to Shanahan, and several others in her orbit, reveal two deeply polarized camps. Her acolytes see the consummate American success story: the child of impoverished parents who battled her way to prosperity.\n\n\"Smart, honest, diligent, strategic and tenacious do not begin to capture her essence,\" said Erich Spangenberg, who acquired Shanahan's intellectual property tech startup in 2020. (He nevertheless plans to vote for Donald Trump.)\n\nThe other faction is aghast that Shanahan, in a highly unlikely alternative reality, could be one beating heart away from the presidency -- or, more believably, that she and Kennedy will help tilt the election to Donald Trump, as some polls have shown they will do.\n\n\"I look at her and I'm like, I don't know how these things happen,\" said a person who has spent significant time with her. \"It's a crazy story.\"\n\nThe Kennedy campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nIn a race that might come down to tiny margins, Shanahan, an unknown figure to most Americans, could determine the most consequential election in generations. Twenty-four years ago, Green Party candidate Ralph Nader helped deliver George W. Bush the presidency by winning 97,000 votes in Florida -- a state ultimately decided by fewer than 1,000 ballots. Four elections later, in 2016, fellow Green Party nominee Jill Stein was accused of knifing Democrats once more, this time by drawing votes from Hillary Clinton in her run against Trump.\n\nNeither of those candidates had Kennedy's name recognition, nor Shanahan's near-limitless war chest. Armed with her cash, Kennedy says he has already gathered enough signatures to appear on the ballot in three swing states, with more to come, and has formed an eclectic coalition of supporters, from disgraced actor Kevin Spacey to billionaire Bill Ackman, venture capitalist David Sacks, Trump megadonor Timothy Mellon, and podcaster-in-chief Joe Rogan. He is averaging 10 percent support in national polls, according to FiveThirtyEight.\n\nEven some of the people who know Shanahan best are bewildered by her newfound power.\n\n\"Other than the fact that she has a bunch of money, I don't know why anyone would vote for her to run anything,\" said one of her detractors. \"And I don't just mean vice president.\"\n\nShanahan grew up in Oakland, California, in a brutally turbulent home. Her mother immigrated from Guangzhou, China, in 1983. Her father, the son of two professional figure skaters, was an alcoholic with manic depression. Her parents had a difficult marriage, but the family lived together.\n\n\"We didn't have money to live in separate homes, even though I think it probably would have been safer,\" Shanahan explained on a podcast this month with former ESPN personality Sage Steele. At around 10 years old, her father's mental health worsened; he \"became a hermit\" and rarely left their house. At 12 years old, Shanahan started bussing tables.\n\n\"My only way out was going to be college,\" she recalled on the podcast -- a friendly interview in which Steele sat cross-legged and neither woman wore shoes. She selected the University of Puget Sound, a small school with a verdant campus in Tacoma. Her two main criteria: the university's acclaimed arboretum -- \"I love trees\" -- and its study abroad program. Shanahan didn't have the funds to visit campus before enrolling, she said, but she had earned a merit scholarship. She chose to concentrate in economics, Asian Studies, and Mandarin.\n\nAccording to her biography on the Kennedy campaign website, Shanahan ran varsity cross-country at Puget Sound, though several members of the team contacted by The Daily Beast did not remember her. \"She could have been on the team, but it's not something that sticks out in my mind,\" said Mike Orechia, who coached the squad during her tenure.\n\nOrechia later followed up to say that he had pulled up Shanahan in his files. She was on the roster for a fleeting moment her freshman year. She ran just the first three races of the season, finishing outside the top-ten in all of them, then withdrew from the team.\n\nYears earlier, as a preteen, Shanahan had somewhat idiosyncratically decided that she would grow up to specialize in intellectual property law, and during college she sought mentorship in the field.\n\n\"I just went on the internet and wrote letters to every single patent attorney in Seattle\" and offered to work for free, she recounted to Steele. At night, she said, she waited tables at a sushi restaurant.\n\nPete Thompson, a photographer who met Shanahan around the time of her college graduation, described her as friendly and palpably ambitious, though it wasn't clear to him how she would channel her drive. She dabbled as an \"aspiring model,\" he told The Daily Beast, and they did a \"little shoot,\" but the pictures never made it to print.\n\n\"I think if you knew her at that time, you would definitely get the sense that her ambition sort of eclipsed being liked,\" he said. \"It was very much like, okay, I'm going to do something big.\"\n\nLife after graduation wasn't immediately glamorous. Shanahan worked a series of sleepy intellectual property jobs before enrolling at Santa Clara University School of Law in 2011, at the behest of her aunt. Around the same time, she founded her startup, ClearAccessIP, which helped companies organize their patent portfolios.\n\nShanahan listed her boyfriend, tech investor Jeremy Kranz, as one of the company's early contributors -- though it wasn't apparent if he actually held a formal role. Kranz would later become her first husband. The pair got engaged in 2013, and Shanahan converted to Judaism; that December, portentously, she attended the Breakthrough Prize scientific awards ceremony in Silicon Valley, as she documented in an awed Instagram post at the time. The first presenter listed on the program was a billionaire cofounder of the prizes: Sergey Brin.\n\nThe next summer, Shanahan and Kranz were scheduled to get married. Weeks before the ceremony, she attended a yoga retreat in Lake Tahoe for her bachelorette party, where she met Brin in person, said a person with knowledge of the situation. She allegedly began an affair with the billionaire, and after the wedding Kranz stumbled upon the alleged infidelity.\n\n\"Why is my wife getting a text from Sergey Brin?\" he questioned, according to a person familiar with his thinking. As the Daily Mail reported last month, Kranz filed to nullify their marriage after just 27 days, on the basis of unspecified \"fraud.\" He later agreed to a more simple dissolution. Shanahan waived alimony but got to keep her Toyota Prius and a Yorkshire terrier. (Kranz did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.)\n\nAs a child, Shanahan told Sage Steele this month, her \"dream was to have a peaceful home.\" But even hitched to one of the world's wealthiest men, the fantasy proved elusive. Brin had separated from Wojcicki in 2013, after having an affair with a female Google executive. The former couple remained on cordial terms, however, according to multiple people with knowledge of their relationship.\n\nBrin and Wojcicki didn't implement a rigid custody system for their two children. They lived near each other, and the kids \"would come and go\" as they pleased, a person close to the situation recalled. \"Nicole disrupted all that\" and pushed for stricter rules, the person said. Her relationship with Wojcicki grew fraught. (Wojcicki declined to comment.)\n\nBrin was consumed by his own career and interests, and therefore had no qualms about Shanahan's more dubious beliefs, another person familiar with his thinking said. In 2018, they had a daughter, Echo, who was later diagnosed with autism. Shanahan told Steele that motherhood changed her life. \"Through [Echo's] experience, I've seen everything differently,\" she said.\n\nTo some observers close to her, the autism diagnosis accelerated Shanahan's attraction to unproven scientific theories, and later her alignment with Kennedy.\n\nIn the speech announcing her candidacy in March -- delivered in a languid tone that contrasted Kennedy's harsh intensity -- Shanahan said she \"got deep into the research\" after Echo was born and came to believe that autism and chronic diseases are mainly caused by medications, electromagnetic pollution, and \"toxic substances in our environment.\"\n\n\"She's always been a crystal gazer,\" a person who has spent considerable time with her said. But Echo's struggles pushed her deeper into the fringes. \"People who have children [in that position], their views can sometimes be swayed, because you're looking for an answer that doesn't exist.\"\n\nIn 2019, aided by a gift of more than $23 million in shares of Google's parent company, Alphabet -- courtesy of Brin -- Shanahan launched a nonprofit called the Bia-Echo Foundation, with a focus on reproductive health, criminal justice reform, and environmental causes. She named Chloe Cockburn -- a philanthropic advisor, the sister of actress Olivia Wilde, and the daughter of a dynasty of left-leaning journalists -- as a director.\n\nShanahan also poured millions of dollars into the Buck Institute for Research on Aging to establish a center devoted to female reproductive longevity, with the goal of delaying or eliminating ovarian aging. The issue was personal to Shanahan, who was once told she was not a good candidate for IVF due to polycystic ovarian syndrome, she said in a 2023 interview with The New Yorker.\n\nTwo people familiar with Shanahan's donations said she caused discord by attempting to intervene in the Buck Institute's work. She allegedly sought to block at least one partnership based on personal animosity, one of the people said.\n\nJennifer Garrison, an assistant professor at the Buck Institute and a member of the center, denied that Shanahan has meddled in its operations. \"She's definitely, you know, not part of our day to day,\" she said, adding that Shanahan was \"really prescient to understand that this was going to become an important topic, and I'm grateful that they gave us the capital to start this.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Buck Institute also disputed that she has played a role in \"strategy, partnerships, or scientific direction.\"\n\nAs her philanthropic reputation blossomed, Shanahan's marriage began to falter. The couple had different views on how to care for their daughter -- a dispute that continues to present day. Outwardly, they were also very different people.\n\n\"At the end of the day, he's an engineer\" and is often inclined to \"come from a more analytical perspective than an emotional one,\" said Shruti Ganguly, a filmmaker close to Shanahan, though she cautioned that she was not privy to the details of their marriage. (Ganguly added that Shanahan, who is producing a film with her on civil rights activist Shirley Sherrod, also has analytical skills.)\n\nThose are the family-friendly explanations. As The Wall Street Journal previously described in stunning detail, in 2021, Shanahan engaged in a \"brief affair\" with Elon Musk -- one of Brin's close friends -- at the Art Basel festival in Miami. It was an act of disloyalty befitting a soap opera, and it left Brin gutted, said a person familiar with his reaction. Musk allegedly kneeled before Brin at a party to apologize, but the mea culpa didn't seem to take: The billionaire filed for divorce from Shanahan in January 2022 and allegedly \"ordered his financial advisers to sell his personal investments\" in Musk's companies. (Both Musk and Shanahan have strongly denied any romantic involvement.)\n\nBrin and Shanahan had a prenuptial agreement, but she argued that she had assented to it under duress, since she was pregnant with Echo, the Journal wrote. She reportedly sought a settlement worth over $1 billion.\n\nRather than litigate, Brin paid a large sum to end the marriage. In May 2023, roughly two weeks before a judge finalized their divorce, he gifted more than 5.2 million shares of Alphabet to an unnamed entity, according to public filings; today, those shares are worth more than $800 million. Brin has not given away any stock since.\n\nNeither he nor Shanahan have commented on the settlement, but the transfer had the markings of a divorce payment. Daniel Jaffe, founding partner of Jaffe Law Group in Los Angeles, said Brin would have incurred a far higher tax burden if he had given cash to Shanahan rather than stock, and the timing of the transaction makes sense; if the parties had already come to an agreement, the judge's approval two weeks later was essentially a formality, and there would be no reason to delay making the transfer. (Google did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\n\"I think it was probably a lot easier for him to just shell out,\" a source familiar with Brin's thinking said. \"While it's crazy money to humanity, it isn't to him.\"\n\nShanahan's startup, ClearAccessIP, hobbled along before fizzling, too. She launched the firm in 2012, California business records show, and raised millions of dollars promising an AI-powered platform that would facilitate patent applications. Ironically, when she sought to patent ClearAccessIP's signature technology in 2017, the patent office slapped her down.\n\nShanahan tried several more times to win proprietary rights for the company's software, fighting through a multi-year appeals and reapplication process, to no avail. Despite her own credentials as an intellectual property attorney, she brought in two successive law firms after failing pro se, only for them to come up short, too. The most recent rejection arrived last September.\n\n\"She's really trying. She's really trying hard. But she just can't do it,\" patent attorney Russ Weinzimmer told The Daily Beast.\n\nWeinzimmer also noted that when Shanahan first applied for a patent, she signed documents attesting that the company qualified for fee discounts as a \"micro-entity,\" meaning that neither she nor any party with ownership interest in the invention had earned more than $169,548 the prior year. The discounts likely amounted to only a few hundred dollars, he said -- which surprised him, given her then husband's staggering wealth.\n\nBrin was at least lightly involved in the business, said Dylan Gittleman, a ClearAccessIP adviser. \"He'd come by, he'd provide input. And, you know, some of us thought maybe down the road Google would acquire the entity,\" he said.\n\nNo such luck. Instead, in 2020, Shanahan offloaded the company to a firm called IPwe for a mix of cash and stock, said Spangenberg, IPwe's founder.\n\n\"The company was sold owing to multiple circumstances that included that she had a baby... And then the marriage was going south, and she just didn't have the time to commit anymore,\" added Gittleman, who spoke highly of Shanahan.\n\nHe described the deal as a \"pretty successful\" exit, though the cash portion of the transaction was likely small, since IPwe had raised just $5 million at the time of the acquisition, according to PitchBook.\n\nThe combined companies struggled to maintain traction. In March, IPwe filed for Chapter 7 liquidation. Its bankruptcy petition revealed that it had just $50.54 in its bank account. The total value of all its intellectual property holdings in the most recent tax year was just $2,394.\n\nEarlier this year, Shanahan and her new partner were at dinner with Kennedy and his wife, Cheryl Hines -- who starred on Curb Your Enthusiasm -- when Strumwasser made his proposal for Shanahan to enter the veepstakes.\n\n\"Both Cheryl and Bobby spin around in their chairs, and they're looking at me, and they're like, 'Would you consider it'\" Shanahan recounted on Steele's podcast.\n\n\"I said, 'Well, no one's asked me.'\"\n\nSoon after, Kennedy informed Shanahan that she was his pick. In public, he forcefully denied that he would ever \"choose a vice presidential candidate based on how much money that they have.\" But it was hard to dispute that his campaign was thirsting for cash, and that Shanahan had already ponied up $4 million to help pay for his Super PAC's controversial Super Bowl ad in February, which mirrored a famous advertisement once run by John F. Kennedy.\n\nShanahan touted her credentials, including her work at the Stanford Center for Legal Informatics, where she conducted research \"on the pace and nature of society's adoption of artificial intelligence for law and government,\" according to her academic profile.\n\nShe also argued that her disparate life experiences make her a uniquely qualified running mate. \"I've been, you know, standing in line at Safeway with food stamps. And I've been flying all over the world in helicopters and private planes,\" she told Steele.\n\nShanahan's campaign biography paints her as an approachable nature lover -- matching Kennedy's branding -- and notes that she surfs and snowboards, owns two dogs, and grows her own food with Strumwasser.\n\nAsked in an interview with NewsNation why Shanahan would be qualified to run the country, Kennedy described her as an \"expert\" in artificial intelligence and chronic diseases. \"People have said to me, 'Well you should've brought an insider in as VP. No, the insiders [are] the ones who gave us the chronic disease epidemic.\"\n\nKennedy's pitch does not square with some close-range perceptions of Shanahan. A person who knows her well dismissed the notion that she has cutting edge expertise in artificial intelligence, asserting, a little hyperbolically, that she couldn't differentiate \"AI from a tennis ball.\"\n\nPeter Hotez, professor of pediatrics and molecular virology at Baylor College of Medicine, was also incredulous. \"No physician scientist that I know of would ever claim that they're an expert on the entire category of chronic illness. That's absurd,\" he said. \"And the idea that someone like Nicole Shanahan, who has no formal training in medicine or science, appoints herself an expert is just ridiculous.\"\n\nNumerous members of the Kennedy dynasty have publicly rebuked RFK Jr.'s candidacy. Over the summer, after he argued that the coronavirus may have been \"ethnically targeted,\" his brother Joe Kennedy II called his statements \"morally and factually wrong.\"\n\nMonths later, when RFK Jr. ditched the Democratic Party and vowed to take on Joe Biden as an independent, four of his siblings released a statement blasting his \"dangerous\" campaign. \"Bobby might share the same name as our father, but he does not share the same values, vision, or judgment,\" they wrote.\n\nAmong Biden supporters in Silicon Valley, Shanahan has been accused of a similar betrayal.\n\n\"In the past I would've described her as a conventional liberal -- very, very upset when Hillary lost to Donald Trump,\" said one of her former social contacts. \"But she wouldn't be the first politician, and I put that in quotes, who changed her position to suit her needs.\"\n\nKennedy has rejected calls to drop out of the race and denies that he will sink Biden's chances. Last month, he joyfully declared himself a spoiler candidate both \"for President Biden and for President Trump.\"\n\nWeeks since her premiere on the ticket, Shanahan is still taking things slow. A Washington Post story on May 4 noted that she had not attended a single in-person campaign event and has remained an enigma even to Kennedy's own supporters.\n\nThere are still six months to the election, plenty of time for anything to change. But Trump and Biden's team are already flaming Kennedy, and the catastrophizers who have spent time with Shanahan are panicked that her money might seal the demise of the American experiment, even if Kennedy bombs at the ballot box.\n\n\"Brin invented Google\" -- once heralded for its \"Do No Evil\" slogan -- \"and you'd think that would always be the thing he would be most famous for,\" a person close to the billionaire said. \"But if his divorce money ends up destroying democracy by re-electing Donald Trump, I think that will trump the story.\"\n\nThe truth is that Shanahan has little to lose. Born into nothing, she slowly laddered up: scholar student, college graduate, lawyer, wife, philanthropist, near-billionaire divorcee. And the oxygen, where she stands, is apparently still not sufficiently thin.\n\nAt her campaign announcement in late March, Shanahan stood before Kennedy's rowdy fans, beamed in her lilac pantsuit, and made a brash prediction: \"I will be the youngest vice president in American history.\"", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sage_Steele", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sage Steele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Brin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sergey Brin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Autism spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

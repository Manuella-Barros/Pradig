{"id": 231349484, "title": "Review: Acclaimed country act performs 1st Bay Area show in over 14 years", "text": "Wearing his trademark black cowboy hat and a sizable grin, Kix Brooks greeted the large crowd of country music fans who stood before him in Mountain View. \u201cWe are glad to be back in California,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have had some of the greatest parties of our lives in this place.\u201d And Brooks and his longtime musical partner Ronnie Dunn would have yet another one on as the platinum-plus-selling duo \u2014 known as Brooks & Dunn \u2014 finally brought the Reboot Tour to Shoreline Amphitheatre for a rip-roaring fun Friday night (June 7). The approximately 12,000 fans in attendance acted like they\u2019d been counting down the days for this event to happen \u2014 and, indeed, a goodly portion probably had been \u2014 as evidenced by the way they hooted and hollered, boot-scooted and, of course, then boogied through one big hit after another during the 19-song set. It was the first time that Brooks & Dunn performed in the Bay Area since 2010, which was the same year that \u201cBoot Scootin\u2019 Boogie\u201d duo decided to call it quits on a career that was highlighted by an amazing 20 No. 1 country singles. Five years later, they\u2019d regroup for a lengthy residency with the legendary Reba McEntire in Las Vegas, which nicely set the set stage for a full-on reunion tour that was suppose to begin in 2020. Then COVID hit, of course, which pushed Brooks & Dunn\u2019s Reboot Tour (and pretty much everything else entertainment related) back. Fast forward another four years and \u2014 well, you can understand why Bay Area fans were so excited to finally get their first date with the Grammy-winning duo in over 14 years. Backed by a rock-solid seven-piece band, Brooks & Dunn were in primetime \u201990s-era form throughout the roughly 90-minute set. They wasted no time in getting the party started as they opened the show with one of their best \u2014 \u201cBrand New Man\u201d \u2014 the anthemic title track from the twosome\u2019s landmark debut of 1991. The 71-year-old Dunn, wearing mirrored sunglasses and a baseball cap on backwards, was in particularly good voice as he crooned through \u201cBrand New Man,\u201d \u201cMy Next Broken Heart\u201d (also from that same debut album) and \u201cRed Dirt Road,\u201d the title track from the duo\u2019s 2003 album that resulted in one of the evening\u2019s most passionate audience sing-alongs at Shoreline. \u201c\u2018Red Dirt Road\u2019 is my favorite song that Ronnie and I ever wrote together,\u201d said the 69-year-old Brooks, signing off on the crowd\u2019s exuberant reaction to the power ballad. Although not on the same level as a singer as Dunn, Brooks would also deliver a handful of highlights during the show, including a really nice version of the ballad \u201cYou\u2019re Gonna Miss Me When I\u2019m Gone,\u201d which was the sole selection of the night from 1994\u2019s \u201cWaitin\u2019 on Sundown.\u201d Setlist 1. \u201cBrand New Man\u201d 2. \u201cPut a Girl in It\u201d 3. \u201cMy Next Broken Heart\u201d 4. \u201cMama Don\u2019t Get Dressed Up for Nothing\u201d 5. \u201cWe\u2019ll Burn That Bridge\u201d 6. \u201cYou\u2019re Gonna Miss Me When I\u2019m Gone\u201d 7. \u201cAin\u2019t Nothing \u2018Bout You\u201d 8. \u201cRed Dirt Road\u201d 9. \u201cLost and Found\u201d 10. \u201cHard Workin\u2019 Man\u201d 11. \u201cPlay Something Country\u201d 12. \u201cCowgirls Don\u2019t Cry\u201d 13. \u201cShe Likes to Get Out of Town\u201d 14. \u201cNeon Moon\u201d 15. \u201cRock My World (Little Country Girl)\u201d 16. \u201cBelieve\u201d 17. \u201cMy Maria\u201d Encore: 18. \u201cBoot Scootin\u2019 Boogie\u201d 19. \u201cOnly in America\u201d", "summary": "Brooks &#38; Dunn were back in action at Shoreline Amphitheatre at Mountain View, performing their first show at the venue since 2010.", "url": "https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/06/08/review-acclaimed-country-act-performs-1st-bay-area-show-in-over-14-years/", "image": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SJM-L-BROOKSDUNN-0608-01.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:44:22", "author": "Jim Harrington", "authors": ["Jim Harrington"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.316}

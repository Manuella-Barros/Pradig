Biden and Macron attended ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day on Thursday and met separately the following day with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Paris. The leaders both used those engagements used to underscore the urgent need to support Kyiv\u2019s fight against Russia\u2019s invasion. But Macron and Biden have often chafed at the pace of support for Ukraine, especially as the United States, by far the largest contributor to Kyiv\u2019s defense, was forced to pause aid shipments for months while congressional Republicans held up an assistance package. The state visit began with a ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe, including a wreath-laying at France\u2019s tomb of the unknown soldier, and a military parade along the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es leading to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, where the two held official meetings and were delivering public statements. Later, there is a state dinner at the palace for Biden and his wife, Jill. \u201cProud to be here,\u201d Biden said at the Arc de Triomphe. \u201cA great honor.\u201d Biden hosted Macron in December 2022 at the White House for the first state visit of his presidency as the COVID-19 pandemic receded.

As the president\u2019s trip draws to a close, the far right is likely to emerge as one of the biggest winners in Sunday\u2019s European Parliament election while Macron\u2019s pro-European Union movement is flagging. A top French official said Macron and Biden have a friendly and warm relationship and stressed that the U.S. president is spending five days in France, reflecting the importance he attaches to the visit. The official spoke anonymously, in line with customary practices for Macron\u2019s office. The official said the U.S. presidential campaign was not a factor in the discussion. Macron hosted then-President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee this year, for Bastille Day in 2017, and he came to Washington for a state visit in 2018 before their relationship soured. U.S. and French officials said Ukraine would be at the top of Saturday\u2019s agenda, but the centerpiece of the weekend event would be the strength of the alliance, fortified at Normandy 80 years ago, but with roots far deeper. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a good thing for us to remember that we didn\u2019t win our independence either without some foreign help or foreign assistance, specifically from France,\u201d White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Friday. Max Bergmann, a former U.S. State Department official who leads Europe research at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the U.S.-French relationship is strong despite occasional disagreements. \u201cThere\u2019s always tension in Franco-American relations because the French try to do stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re bold, they throw up proposals, and that leads to some friction when we push back.\u201d For example, he said, France proposed putting Western trainers on the ground in Ukraine, leading to questions of whether this is \u201creally giving Ukraine a major, tangible benefit\u201d or has the \u201cpotential to be escalatory and dangerous.\u201d Regarding Macron, Bergmann said, \u201che\u2019s the one that pushes the boundaries and throws up ideas.\u201d Kirby said the two leaders would have an announcement Saturday on deepening maritime law enforcement cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region. They also were to discuss economic and climate challenges. While praising the Biden administration\u2019s commitment to supporting Ukraine, Macron said earlier this year that Europe must become \u201ccapable of defending its interests, with its allies by our side whenever they are willing, and alone if necessary,\u201d arguing the continent should rely less on the U.S. for its own defense. He also warned Western powers against showing any signs of weakness to Russia as he repeatedly said that sending Western troops into Ukraine to shore up its defense should not be ruled out. The leaders were also set to discuss their efforts to bring about a cease-fire to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, as the U.S. and Israel await Hamas\u2019 response to a Biden-promoted cease-fire proposal that would allow a surge of humanitarian assistance into the territory. Macron is expected to raise U.S. trade practices that he has often criticized, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which favors American-made climate technology such as electric vehicles. Macron said the U.S., like China, has \u201cdecided not to respect the rules of global trade\u201d by shoring up protections and subsidies while Europe\u2019s industry remains open and is stuck in overregulation. The French official said Europe has to defend European interests, after watching the U.S. do the same with its own, but said Macron hopes to find a mutually acceptable outcome. Gary Hufbauer, nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said trade with China is a sticking point between the U.S. and Europe, particularly France. The U.S. has been more eager to restrict trade, particularly regarding technology. Biden is also moving toward tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and batteries, which could affect European cars that include Chinese parts. Overall, Hufbauer said, \u201cEurope wants to maintain much more trade with China than the U.S. wants.\u201d", "summary": "President Joe Biden is being feted by French President Emmanuel Macron with a state visit Saturday as the two allies aim to show off their partnership on global security issues and move past trade tensions.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jun/8/macron-is-hosting-biden-for-state-visi-writethru-3/", "image": "https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/06/08/Biden_France_85693.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:55:34", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.432}

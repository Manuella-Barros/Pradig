Johnson, then the Senate Majority leader, who astutely observed of Richard Nixon in 1958 that \"in politics you've got to learn that, overnight, chicken shit can turn to chicken salad!\"\n\nOf course, the transformation can occur in reverse as well, as Nenshi, who until earlier this week at least was the clear frontrunner in the race to replace Rachel Notley as leader of the Alberta NDP, may have just discovered.\n\nOr maybe not. But whatever the answer is, it will tell a lot about the kind of party the NDP has become during Notley's decade at the party's helm.\n\nNenshi had to contend with the leak to The Canadian Press of a letter he wrote as mayor of Calgary in 2019 asking the newly elected United Conservative Party (UCP) government of then-premier Jason Kenney to help out a city scheme to privatize public services by allowing the new owners to ignore the employees' successor rights to their collective agreements.\n\nThe revelation of the letter to Labour Minister Jason Copping, signed by Nenshi, immediately prompted a flurry of sharp attacks by the other candidates to lead the Opposition party.\n\nAlberta Federation of Labour President Gil McGowan, who has been running an aggressive campaign but is not considered by most pundits to be a likely winner, was particularly pugnacious in his response.\n\n\"No New Democrat I know would have ever signed a letter like that,\" McGowan tweeted. \"This is serious.\"\n\n\"I was hoping that Naheed would apologize and say it was a mistake,\" he continued in another tweet. \"But he hasn't done that. As the elected leader of Alberta's largest worker organization, I'm very disappointed. And very concerned.\"\n\nSpeaking to Canadian Press reporter Lisa Johnson, McGowan called the revelation \"a pretty serious concern to be raised about someone who is running to lead what is, or at least was, the workers' party.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\nKathleen Ganley, the former NDP Justice Minister seen as the frontrunner until Nenshi joined the race on March 11, said on social media \"I am deeply disturbed by the letter from former Mayor Nenshi that attempts to squirm out of a deal that he made with city workers. It also tries to change the rules around when the city can privatize a service.\"\n\n\"The next premier of this province will be responsible for bargaining with hundreds of thousands of workers, including nurses and teachers,\" she continued. \"These professionals deserve to feel like they are negotiating with someone who respects their rights and will keep their word.\"\n\nCandidates Sarah Hoffman and Jodi Calahoo Stonehouse made similar points. \"To sign your name to a letter that says that you were asking the government to do something that is counter to your values isn't leadership,\" Hoffman said.\n\nInstead of apologizing for what he might have dismissed as a mere mistake, Nenshi's response seemed slippery. \"I never believed in it, and I did it because council asked me to do it,\" he told Canadian Press. \"I believe that collective agreements and collective bargaining rights are incredibly important.\"\n\nThis would be easy to slough off if Nenshi were a candidate vying to lead another progressive party, say, the Liberals. But for the NDP, founded as a party of labour, perhaps not so much.\n\nBut many Albertans who may not be traditional New Democrats have been attracted to the big tent erected by Notley and are desperate to see Premier Danielle Smith and the UCP gone for good in 2027 have chosen Nenshi as the candidate most likely to be able to win the next election.\n\nTo many of them, signed up by Nenshi himself and his supporters, this is not likely to be a ballot question, if they care at all.\n\nFor traditional New Democrats, steeped in the party's labour tradition, it will be a harder pill to swallow. Nor is privatization considered a virtue in NDP circles.\n\nWill that be enough to knock Nenshi out of the race? Probably not. Candidates with momentum tend to survive such flaps.\n\nBut it does mean he'll have some fences to mend with the party's labour traditionalists, and if the outcome turns out not to be the coronation that most observers have been expecting, it may limit his scope of action as NDP leader. Given the tendencies suggested by his 2019 letter, that might not be a bad thing.\n\nHe'll also need to come up with a better explanation than city council made me do it!\n\nLook for Nenshi to remind voters about the raise of 12.5 per cent over four years Calgary civic workers negotiated when he was mayor in 2014, compared with what public sector workers like teachers and nurses got when Notley was premier in 2017 and 2018.\n\nOne interesting question remains: Who leaked the letter?", "source": {"uri": "rabble.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "rabble.ca"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_j_climenhaga@rabble.ca", "name": "David J.

He asks the province to consider changing city union contracts and freezing wages, to help the city's efforts to \"do more with less.\"\n\n\"Many of the city's employees covered by collective agreements will see a 1.5 per cent wage increase in 2020. This represents an approximately $31 million increase to the base operational budget,\" the letter says.\n\n\"Against this backdrop, I am asking your government to consider and review what actions, if any, could allow for the altering of existing and pending collective agreements that would enable council to consider a 2020 wage freeze.\"\n\nThe letter goes on to acknowledge the request would be \"an extraordinary measure,\" but says it can be \"demonstrably justified given the current economic crisis facing the city and the potential impacts on homeowners and small businesses.\"\n\nNenshi's rivals for the NDP leadership were quick to take to social media to condemn the candidate's apparent willingness to tear up collective agreements with city workers.\n\nLeadership candidate and Calgary MLA Kathleen Ganley posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that she believes everyone \"should respect the deals they've made and the rights of others. It's about basic fairness.\"\n\n\"I am deeply disturbed by the letter from former Mayor Nenshi that attempts to squirm out of a deal that he made with city workers,\" Ganley wrote.\n\nGil McGowan, a candidate for the NDP leadership and the president of the Alberta Federation of Labour, wrote on X, \"No New Democrat I know would have ever signed a letter like that. This is serious.\"\n\n\"At the least, this raises red flags about Naheed's judgment. At worst, it suggests that when push comes to shove, he can't be counted on to take the side of workers,\" McGowan wrote.\n\n\"That's a pretty serious concern to be raised about someone who is running to lead what is, or at least was, the workers' party.\"\n\nIn a statement issued on Thursday, Nenshi described the letter as political gamesmanship.\n\n\"Some members of city council were advocating to unilaterally tear up city contracts and roll back wages -- something I could never support. In the end, I got them back to doing some more analysis and asking the province if they would ever even consider these changes. I knew full well that the province wouldn't,\" reads Nenshi's post to X.\n\nHe says that even if the provincial government considered the amendments, city council would not have acted upon it automatically.\n\n\"There would have been another series of battles around the council table, which I was confident of winning after we passed our budget.\"\n\nIn an interview with The Canadian Press, Nenshi said he never believed in the letter, and did it \"because council asked me to do it.\"\n\nIn a later section of the letter, the then-mayor asks the minister to exempt municipalities from the \"successor rights\" provisions of the province's Labour Relations Code. Successor rights are intended to protect certified union workers from being decertified if the business they work for is sold.\n\n\"It may be that some services currently delivered by municipalities could be more efficiently delivered by the private sector, creating savings that could be passed on to citizens. However the successorship rights of municipal unions can impede these efforts,\" reads the letter.\n\nHis Thursday statement posted to social media also addressed the issue of successorship, saying that it \"was about a desire for some members of council to privatize city golf courses and waste collection -- issues I strenuously objected to and eventually turned back their efforts on.\"\n\nNenshi also told CP that he didn't undermine labour laws as mayor and \"won't do it as premier.\"\n\nJeromy Farkas, a former Calgary city councillor who ran in the race to succeed Nenshi as mayor, calls any accusation that his former council colleague is anti-union \"laughable.\"\n\n\"FACT: He and [Calgary city council] took a 2.5 per cent pay cut at the same time as employees received a 4 per cent increase,\" Farkas wrote in an X post.\n\n\"Love or hate him, this is a guy who unrelentingly supported unionized city workers.\"\n\nOne of Nenshi's competitors in the NDP leadership race says the membership will ultimately decide what the political impact of this action is when they vote for a new party leader.\n\nIn an interview with CBC News, Sarah Hoffman -- NDP leadership candidate and MLA for Edmonton-Glenora since 2015 -- says that Nenshi \"asking to break a deal that was negotiated in good faith\" is problematic.\n\n\"I think this is a question of integrity,\" said Hoffman. \"Saying that you only signed something because somebody told you to ... if you're going to put your signature on something, you should stand by it.\"\n\nCBC News has learned that the total Alberta NDP membership has reached over 85,000 members, according to NDP sources.\n\nThat's more than five times the size of the membership earlier this year, which was around 16,500 members.\n\nSome say the resurfacing of the letter is an effort to pile on the front-runner.\n\nKeith McLaughlin, partner at New West Public Affairs and former chief of staff to various NDP ministers when Rachel Notley was premier, doesn't believe this situation will greatly impact the leadership race.\n\n\"This leadership race is not about who is the most pro-union candidate,\" he told CBC News.\n\n\"If we want to be litigating things that people were doing from 2018 or 2017 or 2016, there's decisions that others made in this leadership race that could be brought up, too.\"\n\nHowever, while McLaughlin characterizes this as a \"don't throw stones when you live in a glass house\" issue, he also believes Nenshi's competitors offer fair criticisms.\n\n\"That letter goes into a level of detail that is more than, say, what was maybe necessary if you were just following council directions.\"\n\nThe political strategist says Nenshi's response in the coming days of the leadership race will be an important part of how this 2019 letter is litigated in the court of public opinion.\n\n\"I don't believe that it should just be hand-waved away.... But I also don't believe that this is an indictment of Naheed Nenshi's true character, either, or true belief on this matter.\"\n\n\"It could just get this leadership race to be a little bit muddier.\"\n\nThe dispute turns up the temperature in a race that has been relatively quiet.

He asks the province to consider changing city union contracts and freezing wages, to help the city's efforts to \"do more with less.\"\n\n\"Many of the city's employees covered by collective agreements will see a 1.5 per cent wage increase in 2020. This represents an approximately $31 million increase to the base operational budget,\" the letter says.\n\n\"Against this backdrop, I am asking your government to consider and review what actions, if any, could allow for the altering of existing and pending collective agreements that would enable council to consider a 2020 wage freeze.\"\n\nThe letter goes on to acknowledge the request would be \"an extraordinary measure,\" but says it can be \"demonstrably justified given the current economic crisis facing the city and the potential impacts on homeowners and small businesses.\"\n\n'It's about basic fairness'\n\nNenshi's rivals for the NDP leadership were quick to take to social media to condemn the candidate's apparent willingness to tear up collective agreements with city workers.\n\nLeadership candidate and Calgary MLA Kathleen Ganleyposted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that she believes everyone \"should respect the deals they've made and the rights of others. It's about basic fairness.\"\n\n\"I am deeply disturbed by the letter from former Mayor Nenshi that attempts to squirm out of a deal that he made with city workers,\" Ganley wrote.\n\nGil McGowan, a candidate for the NDP leadership and the president of the Alberta Federation of Labour,wrote on X, \"No New Democrat I know would have ever signed a letter like that. This is serious.\"\n\n\"At the least, this raises red flags about Naheed's judgment. At worst, it suggests that when push comes to shove, he can't be counted on to take the side of workers,\" McGowan wrote.\n\n\"That's a pretty serious concern to be raised about someone who is running to lead what is, or at least was, the workers' party.\"\n\nIn a statement issued on Thursday, Nenshi described the letter as political gamesmanship.\n\n\"Some members of city council were advocating to unilaterally tear up city contracts and roll back wages -- something I could never support. In the end, I got them back to doing some more analysis and asking the province if they would ever even consider these changes. I knew full well that the province wouldn't,\" reads Nenshi's post to X.\n\nHe says that even if the provincial government considered the amendments, city council would not have acted upon it automatically.\n\n\"There would have been another series of battles around the council table, which I was confident of winning after we passed our budget.\"\n\nIn an interview with The Canadian Press, Nenshi said he never believed in the letter, and did it \"because council asked me to do it.\"\n\nIn a later section of the letter, the then-mayor asks the minister to exempt municipalities from the \"successor rights\" provisions of the province's Labour Relations Code. Successor rights are intended to protect certified union workers from being decertified if the business they work for is sold.\n\n\"It may be that some services currently delivered by municipalities could be more efficiently delivered by the private sector, creating savings that could be passed on to citizens. However the successorship rights of municipal unions can impede these efforts,\" reads the letter.\n\nHis Thursday statement posted to social media also addressed the issue of successorship, saying that it \"was about a desire for some members of council to privatize city golf courses and waste collection -- issues I strenuously objected to and eventually turned back their efforts on.\"\n\nNenshi also told CP that he didn't undermine labour laws as mayor and \"won't do it as premier.\"\n\nAccusation 'laughable'\n\nJeromy Farkas, a former Calgary city councillor who ran in the race to succeed Nenshi as mayor, calls any accusation that his former council colleague is anti-union \"laughable.\"\n\n\"FACT: He and [Calgary city council] took a 2.5 per cent pay cut at the same time as employees received a 4 per cent increase,\" Farkas wrote inan X post.\n\n\"Love or hate him, this is a guy who unrelentingly supported unionized city workers.\"\n\nOne of Nenshi's competitors in the NDP leadership race says the membership will ultimately decide what the political impact of this action is when they vote for a new party leader.\n\nIn an interview with CBC News, Sarah Hoffman -- NDP leadership candidate and MLA for Edmonton-Glenora since 2015 -- says that Nenshi \"asking to break a deal that was negotiated in good faith\" is problematic.\n\n\"I think this is a question of integrity,\" said Hoffman. \"Saying that you only signed something because somebody told you to ... if you're going to put your signature on something, you should stand by it.\"\n\nProvincial NDP north of 85,000 members, sources say\n\nCBC News has learned that the total Alberta NDP membership has reached over 85,000 members, according to NDP sources.\n\nThat's more than five times the size of the membership earlier this year, which was around 16,500 members.\n\nSome say the resurfacing of the letter is an effort to pile on the front-runner.\n\nKeith McLaughlin, partner at New West Public Affairs and former chief of staff to various NDP ministers when Rachel Notley was premier, doesn't believe this situation will greatly impact the leadership race.\n\n\"This leadership race is not about who is the most pro-union candidate,\" he told CBC News.\n\n\"If we want to be litigating things that people were doing from 2018 or 2017 or 2016, there's decisions that others made in this leadership race that could be brought up, too.\"\n\nAlberta NDP leadership candidates, from left, Sarah Hoffman, Kathleen Ganley, Naheed Nenshi, Gil McGowan and Jodi Calahoo Stonehouse take part in the party's first leaders' debate in Lethbridge on April 25. (Ose Irete/CBC)\n\nHowever, while McLaughlin characterizes this as a \"don't throw stones when you live in a glass house\" issue, he also believes Nenshi's competitors offer fair criticisms.\n\n\"That letter goes into a level of detail that is more than, say, what was maybe necessary if you were just following council directions.\"\n\nThe political strategist says Nenshi's response in the coming days of the leadership race will be an important part of how this 2019 letter is litigated in the court of public opinion.\n\n\"I don't believe that it should just be hand-waved away.... But I also don't believe that this is an indictment of Naheed Nenshi's true character, either, or true belief on this matter.\"\n\n\"It could just get this leadership race to be a little bit muddier.\"\n\nThe dispute turns up the temperature in a race that has been relatively quiet. A second official party leadership debate is scheduled for Saturday in Calgary.\n\nNDP members are able to vote starting June 3, and the party is to announce its new leader June 22.", "source":

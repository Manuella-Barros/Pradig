Over the last few months, many have come forward with allegations against the rapper, 54, and he has been named in eight civil lawsuits \u2013 with seven of those accusing him of sexual assault. He is also facing claims of sex trafficking, abuse and rape, and has fiercely denied all allegations against him. While one suit filed by his ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, was settled shortly after it was announced, others remain ongoing. CNN reports that investigators have alerted possible witnesses that they could be brought in to testify in front of a jury in New York, marking a \u2018significant escalation\u2019 in the government\u2019s probe. Witnesses have reportedly not been prepped for any testimony, with Homeland Security Investigations agents (HSI) still gathering evidence and questioning those who could potentially hold necessary information.

After going public with her allegations, she later confirmed that she had decided to \u2018resolve the matter amicably\u2019, on terms that she had \u2018some level of control\u2019, while thanking those around her for their \u2018unwavering support\u2019. Earlier this month, harrowing footage obtained by CNN showed Combs physically assaulting his former partner at a hotel in 2016 \u2013 he was filmed grabbing and shoving his former partner and dragging and kicking her on the floor. As she left a hotel room and walked towards the elevators, he followed her, before grabbing her, throwing her to the floor and kicking her. She issued a lengthy statement last week after a harrowing video came to light (Picture: Getty) She later returned to the scene and picked up a hotel phone, before he reappeared and shoved her in a corner, throwing something towards her moments later. Two days after the footage was first published, Combs issued a somber video, apologizing for his actions. \u2018I hit rock bottom. But I make no excuses. My behavior in that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019m disgusted. I was disgusted then when I did it, I\u2019m disgusted now. \u2018I\u2019m not asking for forgiveness, I\u2019m truly sorry.\u2019 https://www.instagram.com/p/C7T6OCKRJ-W Ventura later issued a lengthy statement on her Instagram page, thanking those who had rallied around following a tough time. \u2018Domestic violence is THE issue. It broke me down to someone I never thought I would become. With a lot of hard work, I am better today, but I will always be recovering from my past,\u2019 she wrote. \u2018Thank you to everyone that has taken the time to take this matter seriously. My only ask is that EVERYONE open your heart to believing victims the first time. \u2018It takes a lot of heart to tell the truth out of a situation that you were powerless in. \u2018This healing journey is never ending, but this support means everything to me. Thank you.\u2019 Diddy was hit with more lawsuits over the last two weeks (Picture: Getty) In the wake of the shocking video coming to light, two women separately filed lawsuits against the businessman \u2013 April Lampros is suing him for sexual assault, battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress, alleging that he plied her with alcohol at a bar in 1995 before raping her in a hotel room.

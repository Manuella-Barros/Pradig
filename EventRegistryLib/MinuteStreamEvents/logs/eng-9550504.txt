Anytime an offensive lineman doesn't allow his quarterback to go down, it speaks volumes about the player.\n\nIt would seem normal if the San Francisco 49ers wanted Puni to continue that position to keep him where he is settled in. However, the 49ers have already made it clear that they intend on playing Puni inside. That is most likely going to be at guard, or even center, on the left side behind Aaron Banks.\n\nMaking a move like this could be uncomfortable for Puni. He could step right in at tackle and be fine since that is all he has been doing in the last year. But Puni is extremely welcoming and comfortable with the 49ers placing him at guard. He explained why when he recently appeared as a guest on the Up and Adams show with Kay Adams.\n\n\"When I played guard in '22, I felt really comfortable there. I felt comfortable inside.\" said Puni. \"It was the first year I had played it and I did pretty well, so the transition wasn't too crazy for me... Moving me to guard, I have no problem with. Even playing center I have no problem with. Wherever I can help the team is wherever I'll play.\"\n\nPlaying at offensive tackle could've easily been where Puni liked the most. Now, his best season came when he was a left guard in 2022, but it might not be where he is too fond of in comparison to left tackle. Thankfully he is more than happy to move inside.\n\nThe last thing the 49ers would've wanted is for him to be entrenched as a tackle while they force him inside. Either way, Puni has an excellent mindset with it all, which is also probably what enticed the 49ers to draft him.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Topeka_Capital-Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Topeka Capital-Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshirt_(college_sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Redshirt (college sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Banks_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Banks (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4574,h_2572,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_49ers/01hxfr8p7e3kq80nrhxj.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550504", "eventUri": "eng-9550504", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

The guy has been able to play inside at guard or outside at tackle. Being able to do both well is an incredible skill.

It remains unclear which position exactly, but the same goes for which side of the offensive line he will play at. The 49ers could look to throw Puni in at right guard and make it a competition between him, Spencer Burford, and Jon Feliciano as the starter.\n\nIt is a glaring weakness for the 49ers and a spot that has no long-term stability. Puni can provide that for him if they get him started this offseason. The only issue is that Puni has played exclusively on the left side both as a guard and a tackle. He might struggle to get it down like Aaron Banks did three years ago.\n\nWill the 49ers have Puni compete to start at right guard?\n\nI can definitely see that happening. The 49ers love to have rookies and young players play out of position. This regime has done it numerous times, so Puni could be the next one that falls under that category.\n\nHowever, the 2024 draft class for the 49ers indicates that everything is more for 2025 and beyond than for this upcoming season. Puni seems to be a contingency for when and if Banks leaves in free agency next year.\n\nThat way Puni can slide in after having a year under his belt polishing his skills and growing accustomed to life in the NFL. The 49ers might have even learned that forcing players out of position, like with Banks, can waste away years like it did in 2021.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jose_sanchez_iii@si.com", "name": "Jose Sanchez Iii", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lynch_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Lynch (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senior Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Banks_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Banks (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2110,h_1186,x_628,y_18/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hx7zdby4pbswvsqwzf", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550504", "eventUri": "eng-9550504", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

During his Jayhawks career, he'd started at left guard for a season and left tackle for another. And the potential was there for him to be relied upon at center.\n\nSo, as San Francisco 49ers president of football operations/general manger John Lynch and head coach Kyle Shanahan reacted to drafting Puni into the NFL, the explanations for the pick didn't come as much of a surprise. Instead, they supported everything Puni showcased about himself during his college career. A third-round selection, and someone San Francisco traded up to get, Puni is primed to earn a role with the 49ers.\n\nRELATED: These 5 Kansas football players could hear their names called in next year's NFL draft\n\nRELATED: Kansas football spring ball: Opportunities abound for someone to step up at defensive end\n\n\"Our belief is that we're going to start him on the inside, as a guard, but the cool thing about Dominick is he's a -- it's not often you can say about a player that he can play all five, and we believe that's the case with him,\" Lynch said during an interview posted on 49ers.com. \"He's snapped in practice. He's snapped in the Senior Bowl down in Mobile, played some center in the game. Played left tackle in '23, guard in the previous year, and so we believe he has it in him and that's really a cool thing to have in a player.\"\n\nAccording to Puni, in a separate interview on the website, the first thing that went through his head was, \"Hell yeah.\" San Francisco, he explained, was the team he wanted to join. It wasn't just the history of the organization that enticed him, but the current success the 49ers were enjoying and the roster it has.\n\nSan Francisco, in the past five seasons, has finished as the Super Bowl runner-up twice and the National Football Conference (NFC) runner-up twice. Puni, who loves the weather he'll be playing in, told his agent he didn't enjoy any visit more than the one he took to see the 49ers. He's eager to learn from someone like Trent Williams.\n\nLynch, who also praised the visit Puni made, values an ability to be around a prospect and see that individual around his peers and coaches. Shanahan highlighted the quickness Puni displayed as the NFL combine as something that stood out to him. Both pointed to the Senior Bowl as something that helped Puni improve his status.\n\nThe jump Puni will make from college to the NFL is a significant one, but he's already made one before in his career. Puni, who transferred up to Division I-Kansas from Division II-Central Missouri, sees a correlation between the two scenarios. He aims on showing the organization it made the right pick by making the transition seamless.\n\n\"I'm going to take that same thing to the NFL,\" Puni said. \"I know the competition even gets even higher. Everything gets even more competitive. But there's a reason I'm here, so I'm believing in that.\"\n\nJordan Guskey covers University of Kansas Athletics at The Topeka Capital-Journal.

The team was so intrigued by Puni that it traded up eight spots, securing his arrival in the Bay Area.\n\nESPN analyst Matt Miller, a longtime 49ers fan, recently shared his enthusiasm for the Puni pick, lauding the offensive lineman's physicality, athleticism, and versatility.\n\n\"I think he'll be a guard,\" Miller said on the \"No Huddle\" podcast. \"I don't see any chance of him playing tackle unless it's a little bit of a swing type thing. He was so dominant [in college].\"\n\nPuni recently appeared on the \"Up & Adams\" show hosted by Kay Adams, confirming Miller's analysis that he will start his career at guard. While predominantly a left tackle at Kansas last season, he logged all 848 snaps at left guard in 2022.\n\n\"When I played guard in '22, I felt really comfortable at guard, felt comfortable inside,\" Puni said. \"It was the first year I played it, and I did pretty well, so the transition wasn't too crazy for me. And the 49ers, they got a hell of an O-line. Obviously, they've got Trent Williams at left tackle. He's definitely the best left tackle in the NFL.\n\n\"So, moving me in to guard, I have no problem with. Even playing center, I have no problem with. Wherever I can help the team is wherever I'll play.\"\n\nPuni didn't allow a sack in two seasons with the Jayhawks while conceding only 16 total pressures.\n\nOf course, learning from Williams is an added benefit from being drafted by the 49ers, something Puni's former teammates were quick to point out following his selection.\n\n\"It's really unbelievable,\" Puni said. \"The first thing, my Kansas O-line teammates, they hit me up. They're like, 'Bro, you're about to play with Trent Williams. You understand that?' I was like, 'Yeah. It's crazy.' But in the NFL, everybody's good.

They've reached the NFC Championship Game four times in the last five seasons and have a Super Bowl birth in two of those campaigns. But they've come up short time and time again each time. But perhaps after adding to their roster with the moves they made in the 2024 NFL Draft, the 49ers can get over the hump next season. Some of those moves include selecting Ricky Pearsall, Dominik Puni, and Malik Mustapha.\n\nDrafting Ricky Pearsall\n\nThere have been a lot of rumors floating around regarding a potential trade of one of San Francisco's star receivers. Brandon Aiyuk has one year left on his contract before he can become a free agent. Deebo Samuel has two years remaining, but the 49ers can get out of his deal in 2025. Samuel will be 29 years old by then, and with Aiyuk looking for an extension, San Francisco may have to choose between one of the two.\n\nIt's better to be prepared for that scenario with someone waiting in the wings than not. That's why the 49ers opted to take Florida receiver Ricky Pearsall with the 31st overall pick in the first round. It was earlier than where many expected Pearsall to go, but it makes sense. He is an exquisite route runner who primarily shines in the slot but can also play a bit on the outside.\n\nPearsall also adds value in the return game and on the ground. He turned 21 carries in college into 253 yards and five touchdowns. The 49ers love to get their receivers the ball in open space any way they can, and the former Gator has shown he can excel in that role as well.\n\nJauan Jennings has been a valued slot receiver for the 49ers for many years now. Pearsall, however, has a path to playing time right away in that capacity. In addition, he provides insurance in case they can't keep one of their two stars in the future. This was a great pick for San Francisco.\n\nDrafting Dominik Puni\n\nIt is never a bad idea to add depth and reinforcements to the offensive line. In the case of the 49ers, they could use improvements to it. They ranked 20th in the NFL in pass block win rate last season and 23rd in run block win rate according to ESPN. San Francisco found help up front in the third round with Kansas' Dominick Puni.\n\nPuni was outstanding for the Jayhawks last season. He played over 340 snaps last season and didn't allow a single sack or hit on the quarterback. Puni also posted an outstanding pass-blocking grade.\n\nPuni won't find much playing time at left tackle with Trent Williams still operating at the top of his powers. But, Colton McKivitz, San Francisco's right tackle, struggled last season and could see his playing time sapped. The 49ers didn't expend a ton of draft capital on their offensive line, but at least Puni should be able to help them in some capacity.\n\nDrafting Malik Mustapha\n\nThe 49ers' depth at safety was compromised after losing star Talanoa Hufanga midseason to a torn ACL. That's where Wake Forest's Malik Mustapha comes in. He won't take Hufanga's job or anything of the sort, but he can fill in if Huganga isn't ready to start the season.\n\nMustapha is best operating around the line of scrimmage. PFF graded him as ranking in the 96th percentile of their database in run defense. He also ranked in the 90th percentile in slot coverage. Defending slot receivers has been an issue in the past, so this presents Mustapha with a path to play right away even when Hufanga is healthy.\n\nSan Francisco has been very close to a Super Bowl. They will be right there again this year.

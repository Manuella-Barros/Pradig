This was said to have been corroborated by one Mr Mario Martinez, a Mexican who came all the way from Mexico City to attend the crusade.\n\nThe high point of the crusade was the official presentation of highest National Honour by the Paraguayan Parliament to Prophet T.B Joshua.\n\nHe was also presented with the key to the capital city of Asuncion by the Municipal Council - an indication that the city has been handed over to God for His blessing through Prophet T.B Joshua.\n\nIt would be recalled that the man of God was received by highly expectant Paraguayans at the nation's International Airport.\n\nThe Secretary General of the Parliament of Paraguay, Dej Medina Paredes, led the country's high-powered committee which received Prophet Joshua upon arrival.\n\nShe said: \"I am very excited and can see a lot of expectation in the people from Paraguay because they are waiting for a spiritual transformation through the coming of this message from Christ. All of\n\nus are waiting for that spiritual transformation.\n\n\"We want to receive him very well, we want to be healed and as a Member of Parliament, I appreciate his coming. We are a privileged nation to have him visit our country.\n\nThe local media had also reported that most of the hotels in the capital, Asuncion were declared filled while many international visitors were seen making hotel bookings for the event.\n\nEarlier, Prophet TB Joshua had held crusades in Columbia, Mexico, South Korea and Peru. His international crusades have always been huge successes.", "time": "17:38:00"}

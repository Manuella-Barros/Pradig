The film showcases a new side of Megatron and explores the tragic end of a friendship that led to the division of Autobots and Decepticons. Director Josh Cooley praises the voice performances of Chris Hemsworth and Scarlett Johansson, bringing new depth to iconic roles.\n\nWhile it's been an action-packed summer full of major franchise returns, that only looks to continue as moviegoers start to set their eyes on the fall. One of the first big animated releases of the season is Transformers One. The prequel story, set in the same universe as the live-action films, is rolling out into theaters this September. Now, ahead of the film's second trailer, Transformers One has debuted new images highlighting the coming war for Cybertron.\n\nCourtesy of Entertainment Weekly's exclusive SDCC preview, Transformers fans have been given two new images for the upcoming adventure. One has Orion Pax (Optimus Prime) running alongside his friend/future enemy D-16 (Megatron), while the other shot has the pair taking cover with their fellow companions, Elite-1 (Arcee) and B-127 (Bumblebee) looking at something off-screen. The film is a mini-Marvel reunion as Chris Hemsworth is taking on the leadership role of Optimus, Scarlett Johansson is voicing Arcee, and Brain Tyree Henry will be adding a new layer to the soon-to-be evil Decepticon leader. Keegan-Michael Key will also be bringing life to the fan-favorite Autobot Bumblebee.\n\nWhile talking to EW, director Josh Cooley admitted he was a bit nervous when it came to these actors taking on these iconic roles. \"The one thing that stressed me out from the minute I signed on was, Peter Cullen is Optimus Prime and is Transformers -- that's what my Optimus Prime was growing up.\" He would continue:\n\n\"I was concerned. How do we [follow that]? And when I really listened to Chris, he had this power to his voice. He took the lines and just pushed even further. He wasn't trying to imitate Peter Cullen, but he was doing the cadence and the rhythm of Optimus Prime, and I froze and I got goosebumps.\"\n\nWhat Is 'Transformers One' About?\n\nClose\n\nTransformers One is the origin story fans have been waiting for decades to see unfold on the big screen. Taking place completely on Cybertron, years before its war-torn demise, the film tells the lesser-known tale of the friendship between Orion Pax and D-16. It depicts the events that would lead the pair to become arch-enemies and divide the planet into two factions; the Autobots and the Decepticon. This is something that has only ever been told in certain TV shows, books, and video games. We've only seen small glimpses of the Cybertronian war in the first live-action Transformers film and Bumblebee.\n\nOne of the most intriguing parts of this brotherly tale is that moviegoers will see a side to Megatron that only the hardcore fan base has known. \"Megatron is always known as the bad guy,\" Cooley explained, \"There's just good versus evil, and he's always after power, and that's kind of it. We don't know the backstory behind this.\" His friendship with Optimus Prime/Orion Pax, and its tragic downfall, is the Matrix of Leadership this film possesses at its core. Cooley wanted fans to understand the \"heartbreak\" that the differences between Orion Pax and D-16 caused, saying:\n\n\"The thing that starts to drive a wedge between him and Orion Pax is that the world is not what they thought it was, and they then start to form two different views on how to solve the problem. And these two versions just naturally butt heads against each other. They're really trying not to get pulled apart, and that's where the friction comes in during the second part of the movie where things get real and scary choices are made that really will affect everything.\"\n\nWhen Does 'Transformers One' Release?\n\nTransformers One is releasing in theaters on September 20, 2024. It's the first animated theatrical film in the franchise since The Transformers: The Movie from 1986. The new trailer is expected to debut at SDCC, which starts on Thursday, July 25. In the meantime, Cooley prepared us for the emotional tragedy ahead, stating, \"They eventually become enemies, and people know that. That's what's engaging about it, letting the audience fall in love with them knowing that they're going to break up.\"\n\nStay tuned at Collider for all things Transformers and SDCC.\n\nTransformers

Yes, we're all surprised too. Transformers One will explore the origins of two Transformers titans, Optimus Prime and Megatron, but before you roll your eyes, it seems that director Josh Cooley has accomplished cinematic wonders.\n\n\"Just finished watching #TransformersOne and it's honestly one of the best Transformers movies in a while, the score was great, the voice acting was PHENOMENAL, it's honestly a top contender for movies this year,\" said one user on X/Twitter, with another adding, \"Got another winner for you -- #TransformersOne. Big fan of the animation style used for this one. Great balance of CG vibrancy with texture and detail. I especially kept getting hooked on shots of the characters above ground with those stunning landscape backgrounds.\"\n\nPraise has been heaped on the voice cast, led by Brian Tyree Henry as Megatron and Chris Hemsworth as Optimus Prime. While many die-hard fans were left shaking their heads at the casting of Hemsworth as the character over Peter Cullen, the Thor star seems to have pulled it off.\n\n\"Just caught an early screening of #transformersone and boy does it rock! It's fantastic! Chris Hemsworth and Brian Tyree Henry bring life to the characters we grew to love and hate! Will see it again and again. This animated version is just as good as the 1st live version.\"\n\nRelated Every Transformers Live-Action Movie, Ranked\n\nThroughout seven big-screen film adaptions, Transformers has created a strong mythos and has excelled at delivering hugely-destructive battle scenes\n\nSome do take issue with the beginning of Transformers One, calling it \"slow,\" but once the movie gets going, it really does transform into something worthwhile.\n\n\"While its beginning may feel slow, its progression into a darker tone really showed its potential. The story beats might also feel familiar, but those turning points are SO impactful when they happen! Definitely a worthy Transformers watch to add to the list!\"\n\nTransformers One Could Be the Biggest Surprise of the Year Close\n\nAnother audience member makes us all stand up and take notice when they point out that Transformers One is being screened \"two months before release,\" which can only mean the studio knows \"what they have.\" Another early reaction declares, \"TRANSFORMERS ONE could be my favorite animated film of the year. A fantastic family adventure that navigates mature, surprisingly dark territory with ease. The 3D animation is gorgeous and the action is, frankly, unbelievable at times.\"\n\nFinally, while many were left doubting the project following the first trailer, this reaction demands that we ignore that hesitation as Transformers One is \"one of the genuine surprises of the year.\"\n\n\"I almost cannot believe I'm saying this, but TRANSFORMERS ONE is by far and away the best Transformers film to date. The trailers don't do this justice. Rich in character & emotion with a deep reverence for the lore, it tells the origins of Optimus Prime and Megatron, tragically transforming once from brothers to enemies.\"\n\nTransformers One AnimationActionAdventure Release Date September 13, 2024 Director Josh Cooley Cast Scarlett Johansson , Brian Tyree Henry , Jon Hamm , Chris Hemsworth , Laurence Fishburne , Keegan-Michael Key Main Genre Animation Writers Andrew Barrer , Steve Desmond , Gabriel Ferrari Studio Entertainment One, Hasbro, Nickelodeon Movies Expand\n\nDirected by Josh Cooley, Transformers One stars Chris Hemsworth as Orion Pax, aka Optimus Prime, Brian Tyree Henry as D-16, aka Megatron, Scarlett Johansson as Elita, Keegan-Michael Key as B-127, aka Bumblebee, Laurence Fishburne as Alpha Trion, Jon Hamm as Sentinel Prime, and Steve Buscemi.

I especially kept getting hooked on shots of the characters aboveground with those stunning landscape backgrounds.\"\n\nWilson of Black Film and TV wrote that \"Chris Hemsworth and Brian Tyree Henry bring life to the characters we grew to love and hate!\" He also confirmed he intends to see it \"again and again.\"\n\nBrandon Slagle was similarly amazed at how Transformers One is better than its trailer, and even revealed, \"People cheered Endgame style numbers times,\" referencing the way Marvel's Avengers: Endgame had audiences reacting loudly in theaters.\n\nLiam T. Crowley commented on how the early screenings show Paramount is very confident in the movie, and \"damn is it justified.\" Crowley also declares it to be the \"best Transformers theatrical experience I've had.\"\n\nWhat Comes After Transformers One?\n\nTransformers Has A Big Future In Animation And Live-Action\n\nClose\n\nHowever, the franchise's future isn't limited to animation, as a new movie set up by Transformers: Rise of the Beasts' ending is already in development.\n\nShould Transformers One live up to the early praise and succeed at the box office, longtime franchise producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura already has a clear vision for further animated installments of the franchise. When unveiling details about Transformers One in 2023, the producer revealed there had been discussions about expanding the prequel into a trilogy. While Hemsworth's Orion Pax is still young and inexperienced at the time of Transformers One, di Bonaventura teased that he would grow into the character portrayed by Peter Cullen in the original movies, Optimus Prime.\n\nHowever, the franchise's future isn't limited to animation, as a new movie set up by Transformers: Rise of the Beasts' ending is already in development. With the Transformers franchise now sharing continuity with the G.I. Joe franchise, there are several more stories that could be told on the big screen. Derek Connolly is currently signed on to write the next live-action Transformers sequel, with a potential 2026 release date planned.\n\nWith many celebrating Transformers One ahead of time, good word of mouth could guarantee that the franchise's first big-screen animated adventure since 1986's Transformers: The Movie is a box office hit. Furthermore, with Paramount showcasing the feature roughly two months in advance, it shows that the studio is confident in its potential success. Now, the movie's promotional material is certain to help build up hype for Transformers' latest animated venture.\n\nSource: Various (see tweets linked above)\n\nTransformers One\n\nNot Yet Rated\n\nAnimation\n\nAction\n\nAdventure\n\nTransformers One is an animated action-adventure movie that marks the first animated feature-length film for the series in decades.

After they gain the power to transform, a schism occurs in their friendship, with Orion wanting to build a better world and D-16 wishing to be \"so much more.\" The two friends are on a collision course, as Optimus will one day lead the Autobots while Megatron will guide the Decepticons.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\n\"We could have built the future together,\" Orion says to D-16, who angrily responds, \"I don't think so.\"\n\nBesides Hemsworth and Henry, the actors voicing characters in the Transformers One cast include Scarlett Johansson as Elita, Keegan-Michael Key as B-127/Bumblebee, Steve Buscemi as Starscream, Laurence Fishburne as Alpha Trion, and Jon Hamm as Sentinel Prime.\n\nJosh Cooley directs Transformers One from a script by Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari. Cooley previously directed the Academy Award-winning Toy Story 4. Transformers One is the first theatrical animated film in the franchise since 1986's The Transformers: The Movie.\n\nThe new trailer was shown at San Diego Comic-Con 2024. During the panel featuring the cast and crew, Cooley called the split between Optimus and Megatron \"heartbreaking,\" and spoke about his preparation for the film.\n\n\"Hasbro gave me the bible of Transformers,\" Cooley said via Deadline. \"This Tolkien-length history -- so much to play with, a huge sandbox -- wanted the feeling of what it was like to play with the toys as a kid, that feeling of nostalgia and joy trying to make these things work.\"\n\nTransformers One arrives in theaters on September 20, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "digitaltrends.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Trends"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_girolamo@digitaltrends.com", "name": "Dan Girolamo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transformers (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatron", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Megatron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Optimus Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Pictures", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orion Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Tyree_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Tyree Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Cooley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Cooley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starscream", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starscream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Fishburne", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laurence Fishburne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decepticon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decepticon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Autobot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblebee_(Transformers)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bumblebee (Transformers)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Buscemi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Buscemi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_Johansson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scarlett Johansson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan-Michael_Key", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keegan-Michael Key"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Hamm", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Hamm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Comic-Con"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Story_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toy Story (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transformers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasbro", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hasbro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Transformers-One-.jpg?resize=800%2C418&p=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759382", "eventUri": "eng-9759382", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-09-", "textStart": 1828, "textEnd": 1840}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

The animated film explores Optimus Prime and Megatron's origins. Transformers One isn't part of the live-action timeline but explores the history of the Transformers race.\n\nThe Transformers franchise continues with Transformers One in 2024, and, at San Diego Comic-Con, one of the film's producers confirmed when it will be set in relation to the live-action Transformers movies. The animated science fiction action film, directed by Josh Cooley and written by Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari, brings the audience back to Optimus Prime and Megatron's origins. Transformers One takes place on Cybertron (the home planet of the Transformers) and dives deeper into the Transformers race's history. So, it makes sense that the animated feature will be set many years ago.\n\nThe voice cast of Transformers One includes Chris Hemsworth as Optimus Prime, Brian Tyree Henry as Megatron, Scarlett Johansson as Elita, Keegan-Michael Key as Bumblebee, Laurence Fishburne as Alpha Trion, and Jon Hamm as Sentinel Prime. With an all-star cast and an established successful franchise, Transformers One is expected to be a box-office success when it premieres in September 2024. The animated film should pull in a wide range of viewers, including many eager for the franchise to explore the beginning of the Transformers race's history.\n\nTransformers One Takes Place 3 Billion Years Before Any Other Transformers Movie Producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura Revealed The Animated Film's Place On The Timeline Close\n\nWhile attending Transformers One's panel at San Diego Comic-Con 2024, Screen Rant learned the animated movie will be set around 3 billion years before the live-action Transformers films' timeline. Producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura disclosed the fact while speaking to the audience. Di Bonaventura, who has worked on every Transformers live-action project since 2007, said, \"[Transformers One takes place] 3 billion years before what we've done before.\"\n\nTransformers Movies\n\nRelease Date\n\nTransformers\n\nJuly 3, 2007\n\nTransformers: Revenge of the Fallen\n\nJune 24, 2009\n\nTransformers: Dark of the Moon\n\nJune 29, 2011\n\nTransformers: Age of Extinction\n\nJune 27, 2014\n\nTransformers: The Last Knight\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\nBumblebee\n\nDecember 21, 2018\n\nTransformers: Rise of the Beasts\n\nJune 9, 2023\n\nTransformers One\n\nSeptember 20, 2024\n\nOf course, this significant time difference between Transformers One and Transformers (2007) isn't too surprising. Transformers One's story centers around the origins of Optimus Prime, Megatron, Bumblebee, and other Transformers, after all. However, just because di Bonaventura used the live-action movies to convey the animated film's time period, that doesn't mean they are connected.\n\nRelated I'm Very Worried About Transformers One After Major $1.3 Billion Movie Franchise Announcement\n\nTransformers One's recent trailer has caused several worries, especially after a recent announcement about a different, $1.3 billion franchise.\n\nTransformers One Is Not Part Of The Same Timeline As Previous Transformers Movies The 2024 Film's Story Isn't Directly Connected To Previous Transformers Films\n\nYes, Transformers One predates the live-action Transformers movies. However, Paramount Pictures is not labeling it as a prequel, nor is there any explicit correlation between the 2024 film and the previous ones. The animated science fiction action project serves as a standalone movie that cannot be directly placed on the live-action timeline as it assumingly takes place in a separate universe. Ultimately, Transformers One won't follow the established canon in the Transformers franchise, but, when strictly talking about time, the animated movie's events occur 3 billion years before the other films.\n\nTransformers One Not Yet RatedAnimationActionAdventure\n\nTransformers One is an animated action-adventure movie that marks the first animated feature-length film for the series in decades. The film will be a prequel to the franchise, and will tell the story of Optimus Prime and Megatron in their early years, how they met, and a closer look at the war on their home planet, Cybertron.\n\nDirector Josh Cooley Release Date September 20, 2024 Distributor(s) Paramount Pictures Writers Andrew Barrer , Steve Desmond , Gabriel Ferrari Cast Scarlett Johansson , Chris Hemsworth ,

Paramount has debuted the second official trailer for Transformers One, an animation creation by Hasbro & New Republic Pictures. Telling the story of how Optimus and Megatron went from being friends to enemies. Transformers One is based on the Transformers toyline by Hasbro and is the 8th installment in the Transformers movies series. This \"prequel\" is set on the planet Cybertron and will center on the relationship between the bots Optimus Prime and Megatron, and how they turned against each other. Directed by Josh Cooley (Toy Story 4), the ensemble voice cast includes Chris Hemsworth as Optimus, Brian Tyree Henry as Megatron, Scarlett Johansson as Elita, Keegan-Michael Key as Bumblebee, with Jon Hamm, Laurence Fishburne, and Steve Buscemi. This is a much, much better than the first trailer, which played like a wacky cartoon. This time it looks like a proper full-on, sci-fi epic about the war raging on Cybertron. Now I'm excited! Fire it up.\n\n\"Every Transformer has an origin.\" Transformers One is the untold origin story of Optimus Prime and Megatron, better known as sworn enemies, but once were friends bonded like brothers who changed the fate of Cybertron forever. In the first-ever fully CG-animated Transformers movie, Transformers One features a star-studded voice cast, including Chris Hemsworth, Brian Tyree Henry, Scarlett Johansson, Keegan-Michael Key, Steve Buscemi, along with Laurence Fishburne & Jon Hamm. Transformers One is directed by American animation filmmaker Josh Cooley, who made his feature directorial debut with Toy Story 4 previously, while working as a story supervisor & storyboard artist for years at Pixar. The screenplay is written by Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari. Produced by Michael Bay, Aaron Dem, Tom DeSanto, Lorenzo di Bonaventura, Don Murphy, and Mark Vahradian. Paramount will debut Cooley's Transformers One movie in theaters nationwide starting September 20th, 2024 later this year.

The star-studded voice cast includes Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Jon Hamm, with a blend of humor and high-octane action expected. Directed by Josh Cooley, the film promises to bring a fresh take on the Transformers lore with themes of societal inequality and major set pieces.\n\nFans are ready to witness the origins of robots in disguise as Transformers One's release date nears. The film will take fans back in time to showcase the friendship between sworn enemies Optimus Prime and Megatron and on to Cybertron, the home planet of the Transformers. Now we have another look at the dream team as a new poster.\n\nThe poster sees Chris Hemsworth as Orion Pax aka Optimus Prime, Scarlett Johansson as Elita-1, Brian Tyree Henry as Megatron or D-16, and Keegan-Michael Key as B-127 aka Bumblebee all getting ready for a fight. With slick character designs and color pallet the poster sets a thrilling tone for the upcoming film.\n\nWhat to Expect From 'Transformers One'?\n\nTransformers One chronicles the friendship and brotherly bond between Optimus Prime and Megatron before they become sworn enemies as it takes fans on an adventure to see them changing the fate of Cybertron forever. While most details about the project are kept tightly under wraps, the movie is expected to be hilarious and fun as seen in the trailers.\n\nFurthermore, it looks like the feature is set to blend traditional Transformers lore with themes of societal inequality, adding depth to the story which is expected to see a lot of high-octane action. The feature is directed by Josh Cooley, who previously directed Toy Story 4. Speaking of the feature the director previously revealed, \"I think of this as the beginning of a new continuity where eventually the kind of major set pieces that we come to know of Transformers would still happen, but it might not be exactly the same way.\"\n\nThe movie has a star-studded voice cast including Steve Buscemi as the antagonist, Laurence Fishburne as Alpha Trion, and Jon Hamm as Sentinel Prime. The prequel is written by Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari, the duo's biggest success being Ant-Man and the Wasp. Additional writers include Steve Desmond and Michael Sherman. The movie has equally impressive talents behind the scenes as the producers include Lorenzo di Bonaventura, Tom DeSanto & Don Murphy, Michael Bay, Mark Vahradian, and Aaron Dem. While executive producers include Steven Spielberg, Zev Foreman, Olivier Dumont, Brian Oliver, B.J. Farmer, and Matt Quigg. With a slew of talents behind and on-screen the film will be the one to watch out for.\n\nTransformers One will debut in theaters on September 20.

As previously rumored, the movie will put Starscream front and center as the villain, with Steve Buscemi providing the voice of the character.\n\nAs per ScreenRant, the San Deigo Comic-Con panel revealed several new details about the new movie on Thursday. While this included sharing the movie's place in the overall Transformers Universe timeline, the biggest revelation was the inclusion of Buscemi, who joins an impressive cast including Marvel star Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jon Hamm, and Laurence Fishburne.\n\nTransformers One AnimationActionAdventure Release Date September 13, 2024 Director Josh Cooley Cast Scarlett Johansson , Brian Tyree Henry , Jon Hamm , Chris Hemsworth , Laurence Fishburne , Keegan-Michael Key Main Genre Animation Writers Andrew Barrer , Steve Desmond , Gabriel Ferrari Studio Entertainment One, Hasbro, Nickelodeon Movies Expand\n\nTransformers One brings a unique vision to the robots in disguise franchise, going back not millions, but billions of years back in time to when Optimus Prime and Megatron were not arch-enemies but best friends. The film will chart \"the origins and early relationship of Optimus Prime and Megatron and how they forever changed the fate of Cybertron, the home planet of the Transformers.\"\n\nWhy Chris Hemsworth Replaces Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime Close\n\nDuring the panel, Chris Hemsworth addressed what it is like to play Optimus Prime, taking over the voice role from the iconic Peter Cullen. As one of the few Transformers projects to not feature the voice that everyone instantly recognizes as Prime, Hemsworth's task was not an easy one. Speaking about the challenge of stepping up to the plate, Hemsworth called Cullen's Optimus Prime voice \"incredible and inspiring\". He was also aware that he had to try and not sound like Cullen \"in order to make Orion Pax sound more cocky and young.\"\n\nThis all echoes what producer Lorenzo Di Bonaventura said previously of the need to find a different actor to voice Prime in the prequel movie. He previously said:\n\n\"That was really important because, from a fan point of view, the original voice of Optimus Prime, Peter Cullen, is revered. To have somebody else voice Optimus Prime was like, 'Whoa, we better get this right.' We couldn't use Peter because the audience needs to feel the character's youth. That's why we pursued Chris. I was surprised, too, but not how funny Chris was. I've seen him in things where he was funny. But he has a very strong sense of story. That's not true with every movie star.\"\n\nRelated Transformers One Early Reactions Roll In; Could This Be the Best Transformers Movie?\n\nThe first reactions to Transformers One tease one of the biggest surprises of the year.\n\nTransformers One has been receiving a lot of early praise, and after some mixed reviews for many of the live-action movies in the franchise, it seems that the renaissance of the franchise is continuing to grow after the success of Bumblebee and last year's Rise of the Beasts. With the Transformers franchise set for a crossover with another '80s icon, G.I. Joe, audiences and surprisingly, critics, are starting to find something to love about the '80s toy-based franchise once again.\n\nYou can check out the new trailer for Transformers One below.

The film is slated to come out on September 20, 2024, and will be the first animated Transformers feature since 1986's The Transformers: The Movie to debut in US theaters.\n\nMatt Neglia of Next Best Picture described Transformers One as the best Transformers he has ever seen. \"I almost cannot believe I'm saying this, but TRANSFORMERS ONE is by far and away the best Transformers film to date,\" he wrote. \"The trailers don't do this justice. Rich in character & emotion with a deep reverence for the lore, it tells the origins of Optimus Prime and Megatron, tragically transforming once from brothers to enemies. Josh Cooley directed this animated film to perfection, down to the last comedic and action beat, all backed by an epic score & an excellent voice cast. One of the genuine surprises of the year for me.\"\n\nAccording to Russ Milheim of The Direct, the film was pleasantly surprising. \"The animation was beautiful and immensely satisfying to watch,\" he explained in his X (formerly Twitter) post. \"Art direction and world-building overall were fantastic.\" Milheim also claimed that Transformers One was \"the most interesting Transformers project\" he had ever seen.\n\nMeanwhile, Steven Weintraub of Collider remarked that by screening the film two months before its release, Paramount demonstrated that they knew what they had. Weintraub went on to add that it was also the best Transformers film he had ever seen.\n\nIf the critical consensus remains positive when Transformers One comes out, the film can potentially impact the future of the entire franchise.\n\nJosh Cooley directed Transformers One.

He added, \"It was an awesome, action-packed adventure! Chris Hemsworth really channelled Peter Cullen over time.

Paramount Animation is turning the ignition key of San Diego Comic-Con 2024 for a Transformers One panel to start this year's celebration of superheroes, comic books, film, television, and more! The annual event returns to form after years of COVID-19 cancelations, Hollywood strikes, and major studios bowing out of the show in the final hours. I would say fans are in for a breath of fresh air, but if you've ever been to San Diego Comic-Con, you know that's a false promise. Remember to wear your deodorant, friends. It will be a packed show, and the gradual heat death of California won't do anyone any favors.\n\nTransformers One is the untold origin story of Optimus Prime and Megatron, better known as sworn enemies, but once, they were friends who bonded like brothers and forever changed the fate of Cybertron. In the first-ever fully CG-animated Transformers movie, Transformers One features a star-studded voice cast, including Chris Hemsworth, Brian Tyree Henry, Scarlett Johansson, Keegan-Michael Key, Steve Buscemi, with Laurence Fishburne, and Jon Hamm.\n\nParamount's Transformers One panel began with a sizzle reel establishing the feud between Optimus Prime (Chris Hemsworth) and Megatron (Brian Tyree Henry), using footage from other movies. Transformers One shows how the duo went from being friends to sworn enemies, and the animated film follows the same chronology as the other movie.\n\nProducer Lorenzo di Bonaventura spoke at the show, saying,\n\nJosh Cooley, who directs Transformers One, addressed the crowd, saying Transformers made him want to be an animator. He was fascinated by how Optimus Prime and Megatron became enemies. Cooley's emotional connection to the Transformers property reminds him of his brother. Cooley became a director; his brother became a homicide detective. He liked exploring how brothers can go in wildly different directions.\n\nNext, Paramount shared footage of the film, beginning with a race, like an Olympics on Megatron called the Icon 500. Optimus Prime and Megatron watch as Sentinel Prime enters. The purpose of this scene is to show how things look when things are good on Cybertron, not only when things are bad (as we've seen in the other films). Optimus and Megatron throw on jet packs and join in the race uninvited, with Optimus saying, \"We need to show them we're more than meets the eye.\" It's worth noting the duo are minors and are unable to transform.\n\nNext, Keegan-Michael Key leads the crowd in a sing-a-long for the Transformers theme. There are lyrics to that? When the song ended, Key said, Brian Tyree Henry said Ratchett is his favorite Transformer, and his parents only bought him villain toys, so he played with Megatron. He would often make him the hero during playtime.\n\nMeanwhile, Chris Hemsworth says the nostalgia around Transformers and the cartoons made him want to do the movie. He enjoys the lessons and the escapism. Transformers One is his first time participating in animation, so he's excited to see how it turns out. Hemsworth and Henry joked that they spent months together sleeping in bunk beds to build their chemistry.\n\nThe delivery of voice work changes as the film continues. Early on, Hemsworth and Henry sound like friends, but as the movie goes on, they start to sound more like their counterparts in the live-action films, with Hemsworth and Henry modifying their performances. Henry got emotional on stage, telling the crowd, Henry says he still thinks about the friends he lost every day.\n\nHemsworth also spoke about the great Peter Cullen, saying, As an actor, Hemsworth says he never sought to make an impression, as he's playing a much younger, brash version of the character. If they had done the film with the characters as we know them now, he wouldn't have done it as he would have been mimicking Cullen. He didn't want to do that.\n\nIn another clip, a generation of Transformers were built without the cog in their chest that allows them to transform. In the film, Optimus, Megatron, Alita, and Bumblebee don't have cogs, but they acquire them as the film goes on.", "source": {"uri": "joblo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "JoBlo's Movie

Namely, it's being advertised as the first-ever totally computer-animated \"Transformers\" film, and while that could be a good or bad thing depending on the quality of the CGI in question, the filmmakers behind the new movie clearly put a lot of work into these visuals.\n\nThe first trailer for \"Transformers One\" dropped in April, and it did a great job convincing anyone who might be on the fence about yet another Transformers story that this one's a standout. As /Film's Devin Meenan put it, the movie looks like a \"a breezy and colorful animated adventure akin to the 'Spider-Verse' films,\" with a stacked cast to match. \"Atlanta\" star Brian Tyree Henry stars as D-16, the low-level worker who will one day become Megatron, while Chris Hemsworth voices Orion Pax, aka the future Optimus Prime. Scarlett Johansson, Keegan-Michael Key, Steve Buscemi, Laurence Fishburne, and Jon Hamm round out the impressive voice cast.\n\nA Cybertron-set origin story, \"Transformers One\" will deepen the existing cinematic lore for the Hasbro franchise by explaining exactly how Orion and D-16, once best pals, eventually became enemies. Today's trailer (above) offers another early look at the upcoming movie, which is thankfully going the theatrical route with distribution from longtime \"Transformers\" home studio Paramount. Producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura also claimed the animated film takes place three billion (with a \"b\"!) years before the live-action \"Transformers\" movies at its SDCC panel, but you may want to take that with a grain of salt for now.", "source": {"uri": "slashfilm.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slashfilm"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transformers (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Comic-Con"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblebee_(Transformers)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bumblebee (Transformers)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bay", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_in_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spider-Man in film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Optimus Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adventure fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer-generated imagery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Tyree_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian Tyree Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Pictures", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orion Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Fishburne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laurence Fishburne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatron", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Megatron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_di_Bonaventura", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo di Bonaventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Buscemi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Buscemi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_Johansson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scarlett Johansson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan-Michael_Key", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keegan-Michael Key"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Hamm", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Hamm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasbro", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hasbro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/transformers-one-trailer-shell-for-comic-con/l-intro-1721843310.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759382", "eventUri": "eng-9759382", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Keegan-Michael Key's B-127 (aka Bumblebee) is also a rich vein of slapstick comic relief and silly one-liners.\n\nJoining Hemsworth, Henry, and Key in Transformers One are Scarlett Johansson as Elita-One, Jon Hamm as Sentinel Prime, Laurence Fishburne as Alpha Trion, and Steve Buscemi in an unannounced role.

On the eve of Hollywood's annual convergence on San Diego, Paramount hosted a screening of Transformers One, and the first reactions are almost universally positive. Some of the critics even suggest that this ILM-animated film is going to outshine Transformers: The Movie, the franchise's first animated flick from 1986.\n\nSome of the reactions note that the trailer for Transformers One did not adequately convey the real tone of the film. That preview played like a buddy-action comedy with Optimus Prime and Megatron in the leading roles. Apparently the film will take a deeper dive into what ruined their friendship while delivering real emotional stakes.\n\nAnother common refrain in the reactions is that Paramount appears to be very confident in this movie by previewing it in its entirety just under two months away from its theatrical release. The film also sounds like it's designed to appeal to both classic and modern fans of the franchise.\n\nChris Hemsworth stars in the movie as the voice of Orion Pax/Optimus Prime alongside Brian Tyree Henry as D-16/Megatron, Scarlett Johansson as Elita, Keegan-Michael Key as B-127/Bumblebee, Laurence Fishburne as Alpha Trion, and Jon Hamm as Sentinel Prime.

Paramount is excited about the latest installment in their long running franchise. Just yesterday press and some select fans got to see the movie for the first time and the reactions are positive. Transformers One has a pretty pretty amazing cast, including Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Brian Tyree Henry, Keegan-Michael Key, Jon Hamm, Laurence Fishburne, and Steve Buscemi. These talented actors bring our favorite Autobots to life as Optimus prime Megatron, get a backstory, sure to thrill long time fan of the series. This latest poster focuses in on our heroes with Megatron looming in the background. It's an action-focused animated film so expect some surprises.\n\nWhile you get a peek at that poster down below, Entertainment Weekly caught up with Transformers One director Josh Cooley. He talked about living up to the legacy of 1986's Transformers: The Movie. In approaching something so beloved, Cooley knew he had to assemble quite a team. Getting some beloved names in there was absolutely necessary for getting Transformers One.\n\n\"There's some amazing voice work done on that movie,\" the director told the outlet. \"That was one thing I'm still blown away by -- they got Orson Welles to voice a character in that film, for his last performance, too. So I knew that we needed to have some heavyweight cast in this film as well.\"\n\nTransformers One Covers Untold History\n\nApproaching Optimus after Peter Cullen's iconic work on the character is really tough. Chris Hemsworth didn't just want to mimic that approach. But, in a discussion with IGN Cooley explained how Orion Pax isn't exactly the hero we know just yet. He's got some lessons to learn before he's ready to lead the Autobots into battle. Despite all these expectations, the Thor star was absolutely up for the challenge. He was more than ready to approach the Transformer before that immediately recognizable heroism expected by audiences.\n\n\"I think like anybody else, there is a level of maturity that we don't have unless we've gone through something and that Orion Pax is definitely that. He's a character who's driven but maybe doesn't do it in the exact right way at first and he really discovers how to become Optimus and how to earn that,\" Cooley said. \"That was a big thing with working with Chris as well. Chris Hemsworth was like, having an arc to his character that's not just, 'I don't know anything and now I'm the greatest guy in the world.' He has to have more of something that is a little bit of a character flaw that he has to overcome.\"\n\nWhat Is Transformers One About?\n\nParamount explains: \"TRANSFORMERS ONE is the untold origin story of OPTIMUS PRIME and MEGATRON, better known as sworn enemies, but once were friends bonded like brothers who changed the fate of Cybertron forever. In the first-ever fully CG-animated TRANSFORMERS movie, TRANSFORMERS ONE features a star-studded voice cast, including Chris Hemsworth, Brian Tyree Henry, Scarlett Johansson, Keegan-Michael Key, Steve Buscemi with Laurence Fishburne, and Jon Hamm.\"\n\nDo you love this new poster?

Entertainment Weekly sat down with the fimmaker to discuss Transformers One and the topic of Transformers: The Movie had to come up. Cooley told the outlet that the tremendous voice work on the 1986 feature weighed on his mind a bit. The older film is something of a geek media treasure. So many actors put their best foot forward in the Transformers movie. It's no wonder that the director felt motivated to get some A-list talent aboard to tell this origin story with Transformers One. Clearly, if first impressions are to be believed, that choice ended up proving a great one.\n\n\"There's some amazing voice work done on that movie,\" Cooley shared. \"That was one thing I'm still blown away by -- they got Orson Welles to voice a character in that film, for his last performance, too. So I knew that we needed to have some heavyweight cast in this film as well.\"\n\nHow Do You Make Transformers Without Peter Cullen?\n\nEven with Transformers One blazing a new trail for our favorite motorized heroes and villains, the question of replacing so many iconic performers were still daunting. You can't really talk about the Transformers series without mentioning Peter Cullen. Elsewhere in the same interview, director, Josh Cooley talked about approaching Orion Pax's voice knowing what we all know about the future of the franchise. It's probably best not to try and initiate the legend, instead take a look at what kind of weight this kind of legacy carries and go from there.\n\n\"The one thing that stressed me out from the minute I signed on was, Peter Cullen is Optimus Prime and is Transformers -- that's what my Optimus Prime was growing up,\" he says. \"I was concerned.

She currently lives in Los Angeles but grew up in Chicago so please don't make fun of her accent when it slips out.\n\nIt's been almost 40 years since The Transformers: The Movie came out in theaters, but Transformers One director Josh Cooley will never forget the first time he saw it. \"That one scarred me -- and a whole generation,\" he tells Entertainment Weekly. The animated feature was the sequel to the popular 1980s TV series, and it infamously killed Autobot leader Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) early on at the hands of Decepticon villain Megatron (Frank Welker). Cooley says the trauma of that shocking death heavily influenced him as he made his new Transformers movie -- the first animated one in the franchise since that 1986 film -- and he has no plans to scar a new generation of fans.\n\nTransformers One (in theaters Sept. 20) is an origin story predating all other animated and live-action movies and TV shows based on the Hasbro franchise. The film will reveal that Optimus Prime and Megatron were actually brothers-in-arms who knew each other as Orion Pax and D-16, respectively, before they became bitter adversaries warring over the fate of their planet, Cybertron.\n\nIn addition to making sure he didn't traumatize another era of young Transformers fans, Cooley also wanted to make sure Transformers One boasted a voice cast just as impressive as the one in the 1986 movie. \"There's some amazing voice work done on that movie,\" the director says. \"That was one thing I'm still blown away by -- they got Orson Welles to voice a character in that film, for his last performance, too. So I knew that we needed to have some heavyweight cast in this film as well.\"\n\nCooley assembled his own mini Marvel team-up with a voice cast including two Avengers -- Chris Hemsworth plays Orion Pax and Scarlett Johansson plays Elita-1 -- and one Eternals alum -- Brian Tyree Henry plays D-16. \"It was not intentional,\" the director admits with a laugh. \"All of them just nailed it.\" Joining them to voice these characters who are more than meets the eye are Keegan-Michael Key as B-127 a.k.a. Bumblebee, Jon Hamm as Sentinel Prime, Laurence Fishburne as Alpha Trion, and Steve Buscemi as a mysteriously unidentified villain.\n\nCasting the future Optimus Prime was not an easy task, and Cooley reveals he was nervous to introduce a new version of such an iconic character. \"The one thing that stressed me out from the minute I signed on was, Peter Cullen is Optimus Prime and is Transformers -- that's what my Optimus Prime was growing up,\" he says. \"I was concerned. How do we [follow that]? And when I really listened to Chris, he had this power to his voice. He took the lines and just pushed even further. He wasn't trying to imitate Peter Cullen, but he was doing the cadence and the rhythm of Optimus Prime, and I froze and I got goosebumps.\"\n\nWhen it came to debuting young Megatron, a.k.a. D-16, Cooley wanted to do something different with the well-known villain. \"Megatron is always known as the bad guy,\" he says. \"There's just good versus evil, and he's always after power, and that's kind of it. We don't know the backstory behind this.\"\n\nCooley says the relationship between Orion Pax and D-16 \"is the core of this film,\" and he wants fans to understand the \"heartbreak\" of what causes D-16 to ultimately become a ruthless villain obsessed with power. \"The thing that starts to drive a wedge between him and Orion Pax is that the world is not what they thought it was, and they then start to form two different views on how to solve the problem,\" he explains. \"And these two versions just naturally butt heads against each other. They're really trying not to get pulled apart, and that's where the friction comes in during the second part of the movie where things get real and scary choices are made that really will affect everything.\"\n\nWant more movie news? Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free newsletter to get the latest trailers, celebrity interviews, film reviews, and more.\n\nCooley drew inspiration from many other beloved brothers-turned-enemies stories from all across pop culture while crafting Orion Pax and D-16's ultimately tragic arc. \"I thought about [X-Men's] Professor X and Magneto, Spartacus, Ben-Hur, and Ten Commandments,\" he says. \"I was going to real deep, epic ideas, because when I originally thought of this, it felt like a Cain and Abel story, getting down to the basics of good vs. evil.\"\n\nFans already know where this story is heading, but Cooley teases the way they get there will be powerful. \"They eventually become enemies, and people know that,\" he says. \"That's what's engaging about it, letting the audience fall in love with them knowing that they're going to break up.\" Hopefully without causing lifelong trauma this time.", "source": {"uri": "ew.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment

Early reactions are in, and critics are calling Transformers One the best movie in the Transformers series to date. It seems like Transformers One is not just a movie, but the potential start of a new era for the Transformers franchise.\n\nTransformers One is almost here, and it sounds like the Transformers movie that I have waited my entire life for. I have always had high hopes for Transformers One ever since first hearing about it, as I believe that animation suits the Transformers franchise better, and an origin story would be a unique spin for a movie. Luckily, it seems that I was right to be optimistic, as Transformers One is shaping up to exceed my expectations.\n\nDespite my love of the Transformers franchise, I have been immensely disappointed by the franchise's movie history. Like many other fans, I do love 1986's The Transformers: The Movie, but Michael Bay's live-action Transformers series has been immensely disappointing. While Bumblebee is the diamond in the rough when it comes to that franchise, each of the other films didn't live up to what I know that a Transformers movie could be. Luckily, Transformers One sounds like it will finally meet that standard.\n\nTransformers One's Early Reactions Call It The Best Transformers Movie Ever It Surpasses Everything That Came Before Close\n\nEarly reactions for Transformers One are out now, and some critics are calling it the best Transformers movie ever. DiscussingFilm's Andrew J. Salazar posted on X that Transformers One \"could be [his] favorite action movie of the year, while Next Best Picture's Matt Neglia claimed on X that \"Transformers Oneis by far and away the best Transformers film to date.\" The website has been flooded with positive first reactions, highlighting that Transformers One is a step up for the franchise.\n\nSeeing all of this positive Transformers One news on my feed has been great, as it lets me know that I am truly in for a treat. Transformers One may not just be better than the Michael Bay Transformers movies, but it could also surpass my favorite films like The Transformers: The Movie and Bumblebee.\n\nTransformers One Is A Dream Movie For Lifetime Fans Like Me It Can Finally Meet My Hopes For The Franchise Close\n\nAfter years of hoping for more from the franchise, Transformers One is a dream movie for fans like me. Transformers One is not only a step up in quality, but it honors the franchise's legacy in a way that past movies haven't. Transformers One seems to be full of Easter eggs and references while also featuring faithful adaptations of some of the most iconic Transformers characters.\n\nOn top of that, Transformers One could be the start of a new Transformers series, something that I have been waiting for a long time. While the Michael Bay Transformers timeline did go through a soft reboot, the live-action films in Bay's style have been going since 2007. Now, 17 years later, a new series will properly start, with Transformers One having the potential to bring in an all-new generation of fans.\n\nTransformers One Not Yet RatedAnimationActionAdventure\n\nTransformers One is an animated action-adventure movie that marks the first animated feature-length film for the series in decades. The film will be a prequel to the franchise, and will tell the story of Optimus Prime and Megatron in their early years, how they met, and a closer look at the war on their home planet, Cybertron.\n\nDirector Josh Cooley Release Date September 20, 2024 Studio(s) Entertainment One , Hasbro , Nickelodeon Movies Distributor(s) Paramount Pictures Writers Andrew Barrer , Steve Desmond , Gabriel Ferrari Cast Scarlett Johansson , Chris Hemsworth , Brian Tyree Henry , Jon Hamm , Laurence Fishburne , Keegan-Michael Key Franchise(s) Transformers Sequel(s) Transformers Main Genre Animation Expand", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transformers (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bay", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transformers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblebee_(Transformers)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bumblebee (Transformers)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_story", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Origin story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Award for Best Picture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Cooley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Cooley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickelodeon_Movies", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nickelodeon Movies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Fishburne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laurence Fishburne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_One", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatron", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Megatron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Optimus Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feature film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reboot (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_Johansson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scarlett Johansson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan-Michael_Key", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keegan-Michael Key"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Hamm", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Hamm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasbro", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hasbro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Tyree_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Tyree Henry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/optimus-prime-in-front-of-the-transformers-one-posters.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759382", "eventUri": "eng-9759382", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-09-", "textStart": 3566, "textEnd": 3578}], "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

The trailer promises a solid origin story of Cybertron's greatest warriors.\n\nIt gives a peek into the events behind Optimus Prime and Megatron going from brothers-in-arms to mortal enemies. The trailer showcases their journey from simple worker bots, devoid of transformation abilities, to powerful warriors equipped to battle a mysterious villain threatening Cybertron, which is the home planet of the Transformers.\n\nUnlike the live-action Transformers movies, which depict the robots as battle-ready from birth, this film presents a fresh narrative, revealing the characters' journey.\n\nThe film directed by Josh Cooley boasts an impressive voice cast headlined by Chris Hemsworth, Brian Tyree Henry, and Scarlett Johansson.\n\nHemsworth voices a young Optimus Prime, formerly known as Orion Pax, while Henry lends his voice to D-16, the bot who would become Megatron.\n\n'Transformers One' marks Hemsworth's first animated feature film. He made efforts to not use his regular speaking voice for Optimus Prime, and consulted Peter Cullen, who portrays Optimus Prime in various Transformers media, on providing the voice.\n\nParamount Pictures is set to release 'Transformers One' in India on September 20 in English and Hindi in 2D, 3D, 4D & IMAX (3D) formats.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transformers (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Optimus Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatron", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Megatron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_story", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Origin story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Cooley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Cooley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Cullen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peter Cullen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IMAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "3D film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_Johansson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scarlett Johansson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Tyree_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Tyree Henry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Transformers_and_Inductors", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Transformers and Inductors", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice_Actors", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice Actors", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Substation_and_Transmission", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Substation and Transmission", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology/Voice_Portals", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology/Voice Portals", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://weeklyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Untitled-design-2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759382", "eventUri": "eng-9759382", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 8, "textEnd": 15}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-20", "textStart": 1433, "textEnd": 1445}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

No debate. For some it'll be their favorite. And I'd understand why.\"\n\nHe adds, \"The film features fantastic animation by @ILMVFX, a script that works for die hard fans and kids that don't know anything about @transformers, and a Optimus Prime and Megatron relationship that actually works and makes you care. I'm absolutely seeing this again when I can check it out in 3D and @IMAX.\"\n\nMeanwhile, film director Brandon Slagle, posted, \"Saw #TransformersOne tonight at Paramount. I can't belive I'm writing this after how much I didn't care for the trailer, but it's remarkably good. People cheered Endgame style numerous times. I really hope this overcomes the undeniable Transformers franchise fatigue.\"\n\nEditor-in-chief of Next Best Pictures, Matt Neglia, was also surprised at what he saw.\n\nHe posted, \"I almost cannot believe I'm saying this, but TRANSFORMERS ONE is by far and away the best Transformers film to date. The trailers don't do this justice. Rich in character & emotion with a deep reverence for the lore, it tells the origins for Optimus Prime and Megatron, tragically transforming once from brothers to enemies. Josh Cooley directed this animated film to perfection, down to the last comedic and action beat, all backed by an epic score & an excellent voice cast. One of the genuine surprises of the year for me.\"\n\nAlso, the senior writer at The Wrap, Drew Taylor, was impressed.\n\nHe wrote, \"#TransformersOne really is a miracle -- the first fully animated Transformers film since 1986 is an entertaining, hilarious, emotional romp.

Following a screening two months before the film opened with highly positive word of mouth, the upcoming animated Transformers film has certainly built up a lot of buzz following the mixed reaction to the first trailer. Paramount Pictures released a new trailer for Transformers One, and during the Hall H panel, the filmmakers confirmed that despite being animated, it could tie into the live-action films.\n\nAt Hall H, via DiscussingFilm, it was revealed that Transformers One is in fact a prequel to the live-action Transformers films. How many years in the past is the film set? According to the filmmakers, Transformers One takes place three billion years before the live-action feature films. This certainly breaks from the previous reports that said Transformers One was a standalone animated film looking to forge its own continuity and story.\n\nTransformers One\n\nDirector Josh Cooley Cast Scarlett Johansson , Brian Tyree Henry , Jon Hamm , Chris Hemsworth , Laurence Fishburne , Keegan-Michael Key Main Genre Animation Writers Andrew Barrer , Steve Desmond , Gabriel Ferrari Studio Entertainment One, Hasbro, Nickelodeon Movies The Complicated Transformers Timeline Close\n\nMaking Transformers One a prequel to the live-action films presents plenty of complications in terms of the timeline. The live-action Transformers films already have a confusing timeline as Bumblebee and Transformers: Rise of the Beasts have both been described as prequels and reboots of the five live-action Michael Bay-directed films. Events in Bumblebee and Transformers: Rise of the Beast contradict story elements in the five Michael Bay Transformers films, particularly around Bumblebee's origins and Unicron so things are already a little messy.\n\nFrom what audiences have seen from the trailers for Transformers: One, it appears that there are plenty of story elements that don't line up with either the five Michael Bay Transformers films or the two latest films. It feels like the Transformers films have a more confusing timeline than the 20th Century Fox X-Men films. It also creates a potentially odd bit of casting, as Chris Hemsworth, the voice actor of Optimus Prime in Transformers One, is set to play the lead human character in the planned Transformers and G.I. Joe crossover film. Maybe this means one of the characters can note how Hemsworth human character sounds like young Optimus Prime.\n\nRelated Transformers One Director Explains Why Megatron's Origin Was Changed\n\nTransformers One director Josh Cooley explains why the film has dropped Megatron's backstory as a gladiator on Cybertron.\n\n2\n\nFans might also be reading too much into this. With three billion years as the time difference, animated films are free to do their own thing with continuity. After all, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts has already established the strange time travel rules where Optimus Prime meets Optimus Primal, someone born and named after Optimus Prime and knows legendary stories about him but has been on Earth far longer thanks to having traveled through space and time. That three billion-year comment could be a fun exaggeration, so the filmmakers don't need to worry about the live-action films, and the live-action movies do not need to worry about the animated film series Paramount likely has planned. Transformers: One could be a Schr\u00f6dinger's cat situation in terms of continuity, where it is and isn't continuity at the same time; it just depends on how you look at it or what you want it to be.\n\nTransformers: One opens in theaters on September 20, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "movieweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Movieweb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transformers (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblebee_(Transformers)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bumblebee (Transformers)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bay", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Comic-Con"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Cooley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Cooley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feature film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickelodeon_Movies", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nickelodeon Movies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Fishburne", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laurence Fishburne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_One", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicron", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unicron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatron", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Megatron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Optimus Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reboot (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_Johansson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scarlett Johansson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan-Michael_Key", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keegan-Michael Key"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Hamm", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Hamm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasbro", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hasbro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Tyree_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian Tyree Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "20th Century Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crossover (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.I._Joe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "G.I.

Steven Weintraub of Collider says as much, tweeting:\n\nLiam Crowley of ComicBook.com agrees, praising the cast and assuring those who have complained about the franchise's movies spending \"too much time with humans\" won't have to worry about that in this Autobot-centric story. Crowley continues:\n\nWhile the above critic says Keegan-Michael Key steals the show as Bumblebee, for Perri Nemiroff, it's Brian Tyree Henry who's driving the story's emotional beats. Nemiroff calls Transformers One a \"winner,\" lauding the animation style and writing:\n\nSome fans were taken aback by the comedy in the trailer, and after director Josh Cooley promised there was \"real danger\" in the story, the early moviegoers seem to agree the trailer doesn't quite capture everything that's great about Transformers One. Matt Neglia of Next Best Picture says:\n\nBrandon Slagle writes that his screening included cheers from the audience, and he is surprised by how much he likes this offering. Slagle continues:\n\nDesiNerd's expectations were also exceeded, with the critic writing that fans will happy with the love shown to the franchise:", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [{"uri": "heidi_venable@cinemablend.com", "name": "Heidi Venable", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transformers (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatron", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Megatron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Optimus Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_story", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Origin story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archenemy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Archenemy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Science fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Cooley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Cooley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_Johansson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scarlett Johansson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gizmodo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gizmodo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan-Michael_Key", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keegan-Michael Key"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Hamm", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Hamm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Tyree_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian Tyree Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collider_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collider (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblebee_(Transformers)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bumblebee (Transformers)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Award for Best Picture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Transformers_and_Inductors", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Transformers and Inductors", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Writing_and_Literature", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Writing and Literature", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7iwwhmSK9hpHfFFzpmPXUS-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759382", "eventUri": "eng-9759382", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-20", "textStart": 448, "textEnd": 460}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The much-awaited animated film is being praised as the \"best Transformers film\" to date, ahead of its September premiere. In the upcoming film, which will function as the franchise's origin tale, Chris Hemsworth's character Orion Pax/Optimus Prime and Brian Tyree Henry's character D-16/Megatron will go from being brothers-in-arms to sworn foes, ultimately altering Cybertron's destiny.\n\nSharing the posters on X, Paramount Pictures India announced that the trailer will be released in two languages: English and Hindi. The caption read, \"All for one... and one will fall.\"\n\nThis is the franchise's first animated theatrical release since 1986. Though there are still a few months until the sci-fi action film opens in theatres, the prequel is already creating quite a stir. Those who saw an advance showing are sharing their initial thoughts on social media.\n\nTransformers One has been dubbed the \"best Transformers film to date\" by Next Best Picture writer Matt Neglia. In his opinion, the trailers fail to portray this \"justice\" because of the film's intense character and emotional depth as well as its profound respect for the legend.\n\nAdditionally, he commended Josh Cooley for directing the movie to \"perfection,\" right down to the very last action and humorous scene, all supported by a magnificent soundtrack and a stellar ensemble of actors.\n\nPerri Nemiroff of Collider gave the movie's animation a \"great balance of CG vibrancy with texture and detail\" excellent scores. Regarding the plot, she went on, it's a very endearing and fun buddy adventure that skilfully slips in some serious emotional depth.\n\n\"It was an awesome, action-packed adventure!\" the Hollywood Handle wrote. They said the animation was \"great,\" the comedy was brilliant and Hemsworth actually did embody Peter Cullen over time.\n\nThe fact that Paramount is previewing the film almost two months ahead of time indicates that the company is optimistic about its prospects.\n\nStar-studded voice cast members of Transformers One include Jon Hamm, and Steve Buscemi alongside Laurence Fishburne, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Brian Tyree Henry and Keegan-Michael Key. Transformers One narrates the lesser-known story of Orion Pax and D-16's friendship.

Witness the early friendship of Orion Pax and D-16 as they navigate the challenges of Cybertron in this new continuity. Get ready for a family-friendly outing with comedy and heart, featuring a star-studded cast that brings the bots to life.\n\nParamount Animation and Hasbro are rolling out the Autobots for the first day of San Diego Comic-Con. In two short months, the long-running franchise of robots in disguise will be back in theaters with its new animated outing, Transformers One, taking viewers to the world of Cybertron to see the origins of Optimus Prime and Megatron. Ahead of its release, a new trailer was shared during the annual pop-culture event providing more details about the early friendship of the bots once known as Orion Pax (Chris Hemsworth) and D-16 (Brian Tyree Henry). The new trailer was unveiled at SDCC, and Collider's Taylor Gates was in attendance at the panel.\n\nHailing from Toy Story 4 director Josh Cooley and writers Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari, Transformers One is billed as the beginning of a new continuity for the franchise while staying true to what has previously been seen between the Michael Bay films, the comics, and the animated television series. The new footage further tracks Orion Pax and D-16's journey, beginning from their time as lowly miners working below the surface to harvest Energon for their home world. However, their fates and the fates of their friends Elita-1 (Scarlett Johansson) and Bumblebee (Keegan-Michael Key) are changed forever once they receive their powers, even if it takes a while to get to grips with their ability to transform. They'll have to rise to the occasion to alter the course of Cybertron forever, encountering the social divisions and lurking threats on the planet along the way.\n\nAt the heart of the animated adventure is the bond between Orion and D-16, which grows from mere bunkmates to tight-knit comrades in arms. The film will also lay the groundwork for how they become mortal enemies throughout the rest of the franchise. Cooley previously revealed that biblical epics like Ben-Hur and The Ten Commandments influenced how they crafted the two bots' relationship, showing how rifts in their beliefs and society eventually tear them apart. At the SDCC panel, Cooley told the audience that he felt them being enemies became more heartbreaking if the pair started off as friends. This is still shaping up to be a more family-friendly outing for the franchise, though, with comedy mixed in and action that highlights the animation prowess of Industrial Light and Magic.\n\n'Transformers One' Features a Much Different Optimus Prime\n\nThe Transformers origin story has a cast to die for, with the main quartet of superstars also joined by Laurence Fishburne as Alpha Trion, Jon Hamm as Sentinel Prime, and Steve Buscemi in a yet-unnamed role. Notably missing from the cast list, however, is the great Peter Cullen, who has given life to Optimus Prime since the classic 1984 cartoon. The change to Hemsworth was made to reflect the eventual Autobot leader's younger and more inexperienced self, albeit with signs of what he would eventually become. Even though this Optimus isn't Australian, Hemsworth has made a fan of producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura, who had no shortage of praise for the Thor star, as well as Johansson and Cooley, in a conversation last year with Collider's Steve Weintraub.\n\n\"Also, it's the imagination of our artists and our director, and one of the great things is, as you actually put the voices to the characters- When we first listen to Chris Hemsworth's voice, you're like, 'God, is he gonna be a good Optimus!' Obviously, he starts as Orion Pax and you don't become Optimus for a while, so he's not playing, for most of the movie, what we think of as Optimus, Peter Cullen. So it's that transition, and Chris's voice has a timbre that... it's logical that Peter Cullen would take over that voice, if you would, which is really great, the fans are gonna really feel great. But Scarlett [Johansson] is amazing, and it's just coming alive in a way that it's really rewarding, and we had confidence in our director, and all he's doing is giving us more and more.\"\n\nTransformers One premieres in theaters on September 20.

Hemsworth's comments about making his performance distinct are a relief, and they make sense of the movie's recast. The decision to cast Hemsworth over Cullen for Transformers One was necessary to showcase the character's development and differentiate between different Transformers continuities.\n\nI am more optimistic about Chris Hemsworth voicing Optimus Prime in Transformers One after his comments at San Diego Comic-Con. The Autobot leader has traditionally been portrayed by the legendary Peter Cullen, who voiced him in the 1980s Transformers animated series, as well as all the live-action Transformers films since 2007. Cullen's voice has long been synonymous with Optimus Prime, and his presence provided consistency as the Transformers movies changed with different directors, stories, human protagonists, and time periods.\n\nHemsworth voicing Optimus Prime instead of Cullen in Transformers One is a significant departure that made me skeptical about the upcoming film, especially since Cullen has voiced the character in animation before. An Optimus Prime and Megatron origin story without Cullen seemed like it would be incomplete. Fortunately, Hemsworth's comments have me feeling much better about Transformers One and its ability to tell a good Optimus Prime story -- even without Cullen's familiar voice.\n\nRelated This Movie With 95% On RT Proves Transformers One Is Right To Break A 38-Year Pattern\n\nWhile the recent Transformers blockbusters have had disappointing receptions, the upcoming installment is daring to restore the series.\n\n1 Chris Hemsworth's Optimus Prime Is Meant To Be Different From Peter Cullen's Transformers One's Version Of The Character Is Young & Inexperienced Close\n\nScreen Rant attended the San Diego Comic-Con panel for Transformers One, where Hemsworth spoke about his character in the upcoming prequel. Hemsworth said, \"What Peter Cullen has done with the character is so incredible. ... The goal was never to mimic or sound like Peter Cullen. This was about the brashness of Orion. ... It helped ground the story.\" While Hemsworth praises Cullen's iconic voice performance as Optimus Prime, he clarifies that his version of the character is meant to be completely different. This includes the brash nature of Orion Pax, who is not yet the wise and experienced Optimus Prime.\n\nWhile Hemsworth praises Cullen's iconic voice performance as Optimus Prime, he clarifies that his version of the character is meant to be completely different.\n\nCullen's voice exudes authority, wisdom, and earned confidence from many years of experience, convincing viewers everything is going to be okay. Mimicking that would not only be a disservice to Cullen, but it would also not fit with the iteration of the character Hemsworth is playing. Transformers One's version of the character is young, inexperienced, and only at the beginning of his journey as Optimus Prime. The only way to ground this portrayal of the character is for Hemsworth to put his own spin on it and make it distinct from Cullen.\n\nTransformers One's Different Optimus Prime Portrayal Explains Peter Cullen's Recast Peter Cullen's Voice Would Not Have Worked With This Optimus Prime\n\nHemsworth's comments now make me glad that Cullen was not cast in Transformers One, as he would have brought his usual gravitas to the role -- and it wouldn't have fit this iteration of Optimus. It would have been jarring to hear Cullen's voice and see the character acting impulsively and immaturely. The only way to avoid this issue was to recast the role, and Hemsworth is an excellent choice. After all, his most iconic role, Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is a character who grows from impulsivity and immaturity to becoming a worthy hero and leader.\n\nIn addition to playing Thor in the live-action MCU films, Chris Hemsworth voiced Thor in the animated What If...? series.\n\nDespite taking place long before the events of the Transformers movie, Transformers One is also not a direct prequel and takes place within its own continuity. Featuring different voice actors is a way to further communicate the distinction between the various Transformers continuities, a distinction that would be more difficult to make if Cullen was still voicing Optimus Prime. I am now much more excited about experiencing Hemsworth's new and distinct performance as Optimus Prime in Transformers One.\n\nTransformers One Not Yet RatedAnimationActionAdventure\n\nTransformers One is an animated action-adventure movie that marks the first animated feature-length film for the series in decades. The film will be a prequel to the franchise, and will tell the story of Optimus Prime and Megatron in their early years, how they met, and a closer look at the war on their home planet, Cybertron.\n\nDirector Josh Cooley Release Date September 20, 2024 Writers Andrew Barrer , Steve Desmond , Gabriel Ferrari Cast Scarlett Johansson , Chris Hemsworth , Brian Tyree Henry , Jon Hamm , Laurence Fishburne , Keegan-Michael Key Studio(s) Entertainment One , Hasbro , Nickelodeon Movies Distributor(s) Paramount Pictures Franchise(s) Transformers Sequel(s) Transformers Main Genre Animation Expand", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemsworth_(UK_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hemsworth (UK Parliament constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transformers (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Optimus Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Cullen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Cullen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Comic-Con"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autobot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animated_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Animated series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Pictures", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orion Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatron", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Megatron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rotten Tomatoes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If...?_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "What If...?

Set on planet Cybertron, Optimus Prime and Megatron used to go by the names of Orion Pax (Chris Hemsworth) and D-16 (Brian Tyree Henry).\n\nBefore the two became bitter enemies in a brutal civil war, they worked as lowly bot workers as Cybertron, who lacked the ability to transform. However, they soon make a discovery that could alter life on Cybertron as they know it. Before they came the most hated of enemies, Pax and D-16 were friends who were as close as brothers.\n\nThe film also features the voice talents of Scarlett Johansson, Keegan-Michael Key, Steve Buscemi, Laurence Fishburne, and Jon Hamm. It's directed by Josh Cooley from a script by Eric Pearson, Andrew Barrer, and Gabriel Ferrari, with a story by Barrer and Ferrari.

This fall, the saga will return to the big screen with the animated film Transformers One, and the cast and crew of the film arrived to San Diego Comic-Con's Hall H on Thursday, providing fans with the latest look at the upcoming animated film. Here's what you need to know about the Transformers One panel, including new exclusive footage.\n\nA Sizzle reel shows Optimus Prime and Megatron's cinematic history, ending with footage of how their dynamic began.\n\nFranchise producer Lorenzo Di Bonaventura and director Josh Cooley and stars Keegan-Michael Key, Brian Tyree Henry, and Chris Hemsworth join the panel. Di Bonaventura jokes the origin story would have cost 500 million in live action, confirms that there are no human characters. He says Cooley brought out the heart of the movie. Megatron and Optimus Prime's future characterizations were bleeding through too early into D-16 and Orion Pax's characterization.\n\nCooley says the original Transformers cartoon got him into animation. He was excited to explore how D-16 and Orion Pax become enemies. Cooley says Hasbro gave him the massive bible of Transformers history and was excited to play with all of it. He wanted to emulate the feeling of playing with toys as a kid.\n\nThree clips are shown: first, a race in Icon 5000 (Cyberton's Olympics), D-16 and Orion Pax have different views about entering the face. They watch the race from above the starting line, and see Sentinel Prime (Jon Hamm) address the population. Orion Pax attaches a pack to D-16's back and they enter the race, inspiring people across Cybertron who are amazed that Miners are entering the race. Through an array of hijinks, they very narrowly make their way into the top three of the race. Each clip ends with an interstitial returning back to the panel.\n\nKey was a diehard fan as a kid. Henry was a fan of Ratchet as a kid, and had a Megatron toy, so he was fascinated by the possibility of getting to explore the villain's origin story. Hemsworth loved the toys as a kid, and loved the nostalgia around the franchise as a whole. Henry and Hemsworth joke they became best friends with bunk beds to prepare. They would see each other's scenes and it would improve each other's performances.\n\nHenry wanted levity and precociousness, in order to make the villain turn even stronger. Like with his Spider-Man performance, he wanted to find the heart. Key's B-127 is trying to wedge his way into their friendship. They wanted B-127 to speak a lot to make up for Bumblebee's limited speech in the other media.\n\nIn the second clip, the group are missing their T-cogs, which give them the ability to transform. They receive the T-cogs from Alpha Trion (Lawrence Fishburne) and outrun the bad guys. The crew describes Fishburne's Alpha Trion as similar to Morpheus and Obi-Wan.\n\nHemsworth praises Peter Cullen, and wanted to do something original and more idealistic instead of mimic the established.\n\nIn the third clip, Starscream (Steve Buscemi) and the High Guard kidnap the gang. Bumblebee talks way too much. Starscream argues that all bots need to fend for themselves. Megatron fights him and sways his army to his favor, to OP's horror.\n\nA new trailer also plays.\n\n***\n\nTransformers One will be released exclusively in theaters on September 20th.", "source": {"uri": "comicbook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comicbook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transformers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Optimus Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Tyree_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brian Tyree Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transformers (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatron", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Megatron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_di_Bonaventura", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo di Bonaventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Comic-Con"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Cooley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Cooley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_story", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Origin story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan-Michael_Key", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keegan-Michael Key"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cartoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Hamm", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Hamm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasbro", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hasbro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemsworth", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hemsworth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hemsworth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_in_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spider-Man in film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starscream", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starscream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Cullen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peter Cullen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblebee_(Transformers)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bumblebee (Transformers)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Buscemi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Buscemi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2024/04/18/c70d7e1d-006a-4205-b6ba-d5814231ffd2/transformers-one-trailer-cast-release-date.png?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759382", "eventUri": "eng-9759382", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-20", "textStart": 3505, "textEnd": 3519}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

The \"Thor\" actor was on hand to introduce clips and a new trailer with co-stars Keegan-Michael Key and Brian Tyree Henry.\n\nBefore they became Optimus and Megatron, they were Orion Pax (voiced by Hemsworth) and D-16 (Henry), two miners on the mechanical planet of Cybertron. They're buds who can't transform and get caught up in an adventure alongside two others: B-127 (Key) - who eventually becomes fan favorite Bumblebee - and Elita (Scarlett Johansson).\n\nJoin our Watch Party!

If we tried to do this live action, it would probably cost $500 million,\" says Lorenzo DiBonaventura, longtime producer of the \"Transformers\" movies.\n\nDirector Josh Cooley (\"Toy Story 4\") was given a \"Tolkien-length history\" of \"Transformers\" to work with, he says. But he wanted the movie to have \"the feeling of what it was like to play with the toys as a kid: nostalgia and joy.\"\n\nHemworth paid tribute to the \"incredible\" Peter Cullen, the voice of Optimus across media since the 1980s. \"The goal was never to mimic. This is the brash young cocky version of Optimus Prime, before he became the all-knowing, omnipresent figure we all know and love.\"\n\nHenry gave Megatron a sense of precociousness early on in the movie, so when he turned on Optimus, \"you could feel the weight of it,\" he says. \"Once Megatron happens, damn, there's no turning back now.\n\n\"The loss of friendship is something we all understand, and the idea of friendship is something we all can cherish.\"\n\nCooley promises Easter eggs and familiar characters in \"Transformers One\" that throw back to 40 years of cartoons, toys and movies, and the supporting voice cast includes Jon Hamm (as Sentinel Prime), Laurence Fishburne (as Alpha Trion) and Steve Buscemi (as Starscream).\n\nThe three actors shared some of their own memories as kids. Henry recalled how his parents only bought him \"the villain toys\" like Megatron and He-Man baddie Skeletor growing up. Hemsworth said he had a few of the figures as a boy in Australia: \"We did our best to pull them apart and reassemble them. We all failed, actually.\"\n\nAnd Key, who pleaded with his mom and to dad to let him watch the '80s show after school, led the crowd in singing the cartoon's theme song. \"Now we know who's over 40,\" he quipped.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatron", "type": "wiki", "score":

In animation, you can have them build out their character.\"\n\nThe clip showed off a race at the Olympics of Cybertron, painting what life is like on the planet. Orion Pax aka Optimus Prime (Chris Hemsworth) wants to enter it, D-16 aka Megatron (Brian Tyree Henry) does not. They're part of a Miners pact, a group which isn't permitted in the race. We get a look at Sentinel Prime (Jon Hamm) addressing the crowd, who speaks about the battle that killed the other Primes and the veterans of it. The race fires off, and Orion Pax and Optimus Prime are dropped into the race. There's also a shot of Scarlett Johansson's character of Alita.\n\nOn the dais was Keegan-Michael Key who plays B-127 who will ultimately becomes Bumblebee. The character gets to talk a lot during the pic, per Cooley that's 100% intentional. And of course, Henry and Hemsworth were in tow.\n\nPrepping to play two friends, Hemsworth joked that he and Henry slept in \"bunk beds.\"\n\nImportant for Hemsworth was \"Unlocking the history around the fact that they were friends, and how do two best friends become immortal enemies.\"\n\n\"The first time I've done animation - it's really exciting to see all the pieces come together - beautiful script, fun relationship to work on,\" added Hemsworth.\n\nWhile the two actors individually voiced scenes, they'd get to see what the other did so as to influence their performance per Hemsworth.\n\n\"It's heartbreaking when they break up,\" teased Cooley.\n\nAn important element to the story centers around the device \"the T-Cog\" per Cooley. It's the device that enables them to transform. In the movie, \"there's a whole generation of Transformers born without it,\" said the director.\n\nWhich led to the second clip showing how Alpha Trion (Laurence Fishburne in a Morpheus-like role) giving the Transformers their T-cogs. \"What defines the Transformer is not in their chest but the spark that gives them the will to nake the world better. My fellow Primes had that spark, and I see their strength in you,\" booms Alpha. di Bonaventura spoke about calling Fishburne up for the part; the former Warner Bros. studio boss behind the original 1999 Matrix movie.\n\nThe third clip introduced Steve Buscemi as Star Scream.\n\nSaid Cooley on his prep, \"Hasbro gave me the bible of Transformers, this Tolkien-length history - so much to play with, a huge sandbox - wanted the feeling of what it was like to play with the toys as a kid, that feeling of nostalgia and joy trying to make these things work.\"\n\nOne silly highlight from the panel entailed Key singing the first two stanzas of the Transformers theme song. \"Transformers, more than meets the eye,\" he crooned. \"But do you know this second part?\" the actor asked the packed Hall H before singing, \"Autobots wage their battle to destroy the evil forces of...The Decepticons!\"\n\nFew in Hall H sang along. \"Good, now we know who's over 40,\" joked Key.\n\nJohansson wasn't at the panel as she's busy filming the next Jurassic World.", "source": {"uri": "deadline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anthony_d_alessandro@deadline.com",

Scarlett Johansson (who plays Alita,_was unable to attend the panel as she is currently filming the next Jurassic World film.\n\nLongtime Transformers producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura and director Josh Cooley (Toy Story 4) debuted an exclusive new trailer for the film as well as three clips, each of which landed with aplomb among the excited San Diego audience.\n\nOne clip showed Orion Pax aka Optimus Prime (Chris Hemsworth) tricking his friend D-16 aka Megatron into entering a race, which Cooley described as \"the Olympics of Cybertron.\" \"We're seeing Cybertron when everything's going great, we wanted to really show what the society looks like; what's fun on this planet,\" Cooley explained.\n\nHemsworth laughed but dodged a question about comparisons between Thor and Optimus Prime. The Australian actor instead chose to pay tribute to Peter Cullen who has voiced Prime since the original 1980s animated series.\n\n\"What Peter Cullen has done with the character is so incredible. Iconic,\" Hemsworth said. \"The thing that is inspiring is also terrifying.\n\n\"The goal was never to mimic or sound like Peter Cullen. This was the brash, young cocky version. It was before he had become the all-knowing, omnipresent figure that we've come to know and love.\"\n\nClips from the panel event also revealed a number of other A-list voices in the movie. Jon Hamm voices Sentinel Prime; Laurence Fishburne plays Alpha Trion and Steve Buscemi voices a villainous character named Star Scream.\n\nMegatron's transition from friend to foe was also teased in the footage. \"It's heartbreaking when they break up,\" teased Cooley.\n\nMichael Bay directed the first five live-action Transformers movies: Transformers (2007), Revenge of the Fallen (2009), Dark of the Moon (2011), Age of Extinction (2014), and The Last Knight (2017), and has served as a producer for subsequent films. A sixth film Bumblebee, directed by Travis Knight, was released in 2018, while a seventh film, Rise of the Beasts, directed by Steven Caple Jr was released in 2023.\n\nIt is the 13th-highest-grossing film series of all time, with a total of $5.28bn.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Optimus Prime (voiced by Hemsworth), and D-16, a.k.a. Megatron (voiced by Henry), and their BFFs-to-enemies trajectory on the planet of Cybertron. Key plays B-127, an early version of Bumblebee, and Scarlett Johansson, who couldn't attend the panel as she's shooting the next \"Jurassic\" movie, voices another Transformer named Elita.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nOther cast who weren't in attendance include: Laurence Fishburne voices Alpha Trion, Jon Hamm voices Steninel Prime, and they revealed at the panel that Steve Buscemi is voicing Starscream.\n\nThe Footage: The panel opened with a montage of Optimus Prime and Megatron battling in all the different iterations of Transformers, from the 1980s cartoons to the live-action movies directed by Michael Bay, touting their rivalry as \"one of the greatest in history,\" before teasing \"Transformers One\" as a chance to see their relationship as friends before that rivalry began.\n\nA brand new trailer premiered at the end of the panel that included a bunch of new footage from the film -- much of which was also revealed in three extended clips from the movie.\n\nThe filmmakers then screened an extended clip from early in the film of the Icon 5000, which Cooley described as \"basically the Olympics on Cybertron. Because we're seeing Cybertron when everything's going great, we want to really show what the society looks like, like, what's fun on this planet.\" The sequence involved Orion and D-16 -- who cannot transformer and work instead as miners -- into joining an extended race of Transformers using jet packs and their wiles to shock everyone watching.\n\nA second clip revealed a new piece of lore in \"Transformers One\": the transformation cogs that an entire generation of robots -- including Orion and D-16 -- are missing. In the clip, one of the old Primes, Alpha Trion (Fishburne), bestows Orion, D-16, B-127 and Elita with the cogs from other fallen Primes, which modify their bodies into the more familiar shapes we've come to know for their characters. As they flee the enemies, they all struggle to transform for the first time, hobbled by their bodies changing halfway.\n\nThe final clip introduced the predecessors to the Deceptions, the High Guard, lead by Starscream with his lieutenants Soundwave and Shockwave. The main foursome discover the High Guard has fallen from the guardians of Cybertron into a rabble of warriors fixated on, as Starscream says, \"the strength of one bot over another.\" By the end of the scene, D-16 successfully fights Starscream and takes over leadership of the High Guard.\n\nAdorably, each clip was capped off with an animated tag of the characters welcoming the audience back to the panel, done in the style of the interstitial clips that played after commercial breaks during the original animated series.\n\nWhat We Learned: All three of the actors played with the Transformers toys as kids. \"We did our best to pull them apart and then try and reassemble them, which, which is quite challenging,\" Hemsworth said. He mentioned that recently, they'd been given the toys and tasked with trying to transform them. \"We all failed, actually. We couldn't reassemble any of them.\"\n\nBy way of explaining why he was attracted to the idea of playing the young Megatron, Henry said that when he was a kid, \"For some reason, my parents only got me villain toys. And I would always make them a hero.\"\n\nKey was by far the biggest fan among the actors. He led the audience in a sing-along of the theme song from the 1980s animated series, concluding with, \"OK, so now know who's over 40.\" He added that he modified his voice in his performance in the film to evoke the robotic monotone of the character Soundwave from the animated series.\n\n\"You're really going to get to know the robots in a way that nothing has been able to do before,\" di Bonaventura said, before mentioning that the movie has no human characters, causing some in the audience started cheering. He noted that the film is set a whopping 3 billion years before the events of the core storyline.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

Paramount has been turning up to kick off SDCC on Thursdays in Hall H for a couple of years now with panels for films like Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, both of which were freaking awesome, so we're going to see if they get a hat trick with this one. The new trailer gives us a much better idea of what the plot is going to be. We got a new poster yesterday, and we also got a look at the poster the people in Hall H got along with a nice little pile of images.\n\nWe got to see some footage from Transformers One back in April during the Paramount Pictures CinemaCon presentation, and it was apparent this would be a departure from what people have seen from this franchise in the last decade or so. Not long after, the first teaser trailer made its way online, and saying it was divisive would be an understatement. The anger didn't last too long, though; people seemed to forget or move on rather quickly. One studio that wasn't keen on going toe-to-toe with the Transformers was Dreamworks, as this film and The Wild Robot initially opened opposite each other. However, The Wild Robot delayed its release by a week, so there is a bit of space between them.\n\nAn incomplete version of the film was screened at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival in June, and the reactions were very different this time. Things were very positive this time, and it even won a standing ovation. There was an early fan screening in LA on July 23rd and all of the reactions from that have also been extremely positive, from fans and critics who were in the area. So far, animation is having a good year, and Dreamworks and Disney Animation have two very promising films lined up. It would be nice to see Paramount and their animation studios get a win as well.

The panel also showcased the star-studded cast, which includes Chris Hemsworth as Orion Pax/Optimus Prime, Brian Tyree Henry as D-16/Megatron, Scarlett Johansson as Elita-1, and Keegan Michael-Key as B-127/Bumblebee before he lost his voice. Jon Hamm also gives voice to Sentinel Prime, with Laurence Fishburne voicing Alpha Trion, and Steve Buscemi playing a dude named Starscream.\n\nThe movie comes to us from Toy Stoy 4 director Josh Cooley, with a script by Eric Pearson and Andrew Barrer & Gabriel Ferrari. The trailer also suggests that the feature is full of jokes but also drama! For example, we get to see our favorite robot aliens be really bad at transforming when they are suddenly bequeathed the power to do so. It's hilarious!

The four form a bond as they venture to Cybertron's surface for the first time, and together, they are bestowed the ability to transform.\n\nWe know who Orion Pax and D-16 go on to become, and that reality looms over the entire film. But does the movie simply show how the cracks formed in their friendship ultimately led to them becoming sworn enemies, or do we get to see them have a full-on break-up brawl? Understandably, Cooley isn't keen on revealing the extent of the conflict that arises between the besties. But he does insist that, while the film is meant to be fun for the whole family, we also get to see some serious, intense drama that erupts between them that has, so far, left the test audiences stunned.\n\n\"You are going to feel the conflict,\" Cooley teases. \"It's very clear where we're headed by the end of the film. The third act is epic. I saw it with a test audience, and they were left completely silent and still. As a director, seeing that gave me chills.\"\n\nAs the first Transformers animated movie focused entirely on the robots, Transformers One marks a decisive tone shift for the franchise on the big screen. But fans of the original Hasbro toys and Generation 1 animated show should feel right at home. \"The G1 series was a really fun show, and I wanted to bring that fun back,\" Cooley says.\n\nPart of getting back to the roots of the franchise meant using the power of animation to create a bright and vibrant movie that was more dazzling and less gritty than its live-action predecessors. Because the story takes place billions of years in the past, Cybertron is still a healthy, colorful planet made of all matter of metals and constantly transforming, like plate tectonics on steroids.\n\nFor Cooley, scale has always been a hallmark of the franchise, and while there are no human characters in the movie to crane their necks up at the 30-foot-tall heroes, the artists achieved a sense of scale in a different way by focusing on the sheer size of Cybertron. \"Everything is gigantic compared to the characters,\" Cooley explains. \"And they've never been on the surface before, so it's all new to them and the audience.\"\n\nAnother advantage of going full animation was that, unlike the live-action films, the robots didn't need to look photorealistic, with every nut and bolt rendered meticulously. The designs are closer in spirit to the G1 cartoon, which meant that the characters could be far more emotive with their faces and animations. This was something Cooley felt was crucial to the film's success. \"That was really important to me,\" he says of the creative decision. \"I talked to [VFX and animation studio] ILM early on and told them I needed these characters to be able to emote and act without saying a word.

(courtesy: Instagram)\n\nNew Delhi:\n\nFor all Transformers One fans out there, we have some exciting news in store for you. Can you guess? Oh c'mon. The makers have released a new poster on Instagram. Oh boy. We can't keep calm. Bonus: Trailer release date. The makers have announced that the trailer will be released on Friday, July 26. Sharing the super cool news on social media, they wrote, \"All for one... and one will fall. New #TransformersOne trailer out on 26th July in English & Hindi.\" FYI: the announcement came at a time when San Diego Comic-Con gets ready to kick off. Do we need to say more? We think not. Look at the new poster now:\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Paramount Pictures India (@paramountpicsin)\n\nTransformers One features Chris Hemsworth, Brian Tyree Henry, and Keegan Michael. The film has been produced by Lorenzo di Bonaventura.\n\nDirector Josh Cooley also opened up about his upcoming offering in an interaction with Entertainment Weekly. Talking about the cast, he said, \"The one thing that stressed me out from the minute I signed on was, Peter Cullen is Optimus Prime and is Transformers -- that's what my Optimus Prime was growing up. I was concerned. How do we [follow that]? And when I really listened to Chris, he had this power to his voice. He took the lines and just pushed even further. He wasn't trying to imitate Peter Cullen, but he was doing the cadence and the rhythm of Optimus Prime, and I froze and I got goosebumps.\"\n\nTalking about the relationship between Orion Pax [Chris Hemsworth] and D-16 [Brian Tyree Henry] in the film, the director said, \"It is the core of this film. The thing that starts to drive a wedge between him and Orion Pax is that the world is not what they thought it was, and they then start to form two different views on how to solve the problem. And these two versions just naturally butt heads against each other. They're really trying not to get pulled apart, and that's where the friction comes in during the second part of the movie where things get real and scary choices are made that really will affect everything.\"\n\nTransformers One will be released on September 20.\n\nShow full article\n\nEntertainment I Read Latest News on NDTV Entertainment.

Optimus Prime (voiced by Hemsworth), and D-16, a.k.a. Megatron (voiced by Henry), and their BFFs-to-enemies trajectory on the planet of Cybertron. Key plays B-127, an early version of Bumblebee, and Scarlett Johansson, who couldn't attend the panel as she's shooting the next \"Jurassic\" movie, voices another Transformer named Elita.\n\nOther cast who weren't in attendance include: Laurence Fishburne voices Alpha Trion, Jon Hamm voices Steninel Prime, and they revealed at the panel that Steve Buscemi is voicing Starscream.\n\nThe Footage: The panel opened with a montage of Optimus Prime and Megatron battling in all the different iterations of Transformers, from the 1980s cartoons to the live-action movies directed by Michael Bay, touting their rivalry as \"one of the greatest in history,\" before teasing \"Transformers One\" as a chance to see their relationship as friends before that rivalry began.\n\nA brand new trailer premiered at the end of the panel that included a bunch of new footage from the film -- much of which was also revealed in three extended clips from the movie.\n\nThe filmmakers then screened an extended clip from early in the film of the Icon 5000, which Cooley described as \"basically the Olympics on Cybertron. Because we're seeing Cybertron when everything's going great, we want to really show what the society looks like, like, what's fun on this planet.\" The sequence involved Orion and D-16 -- who cannot transformer and work instead as miners -- into joining an extended race of Transformers using jet packs and their wiles to shock everyone watching.\n\nA second clip revealed a new piece of lore in \"Transformers One\": the transformation cogs that an entire generation of robots -- including Orion and D-16 -- are missing. In the clip, one of the old Primes, Alpha Trion (Fishburne), bestows Orion, D-16, B-127 and Elita with the cogs from other fallen Primes, which modify their bodies into the more familiar shapes we've come to know for their characters. As they flee the enemies, they all struggle to transform for the first time, hobbled by their bodies changing halfway.\n\nThe final clip introduced the predecessors to the Deceptions, the High Guard, lead by Starscream with his lieutenants Soundwave and Shockwave. The main foursome discover the High Guard has fallen from the guardians of Cybertron into a rabble of warriors fixated on, as Starscream says, \"the strength of one bot over another.\" By the end of the scene, D-16 successfully fights Starscream and takes over leadership of the High Guard.\n\nAdorably, each clip was capped off with an animated tag of the characters welcoming the audience back to the panel, done in the style of the interstitial clips that played after commercial breaks during the original animated series.\n\nWhat We Learned: All three of the actors played with the Transformers toys as kids. \"We did our best to pull them apart and then try and reassemble them, which, which is quite challenging,\" Hemsworth said. He mentioned that recently, they'd been given the toys and tasked with trying to transform them. \"We all failed, actually. We couldn't reassemble any of them.\"\n\nBy way of explaining why he was attracted to the idea of playing the young Megatron, Henry said that when he was a kid, \"For some reason, my parents only got me villain toys. And I would always make them a hero.\"\n\nKey was by far the biggest fan among the actors. He led the audience in a sing-along of the theme song from the 1980s animated series, concluding with, \"OK, so now know who's over 40.\" He added that he modified his voice in his performance in the film to evoke the robotic monotone of the character Soundwave from the animated series.\n\n\"You're really going to get to know the robots in a way that nothing has been able to do before,\" di Bonaventura said, before mentioning that the movie has no human characters, causing some in the audience started cheering. He noted that the film is set a whopping 3 billion years before the events of the core storyline.", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Bumblebee, and Scarlett Johansson's Elita-1 being captured and brought to a ruthless group of warriors known as the Cybertron High Guard. Bee recognizes their leader is Starscream, but when Starscream tries to order the foursome to kneel to him, D-16 refuses. The two end up in a fight where D-16 overpowers Starscream and damages his neck, revealing the origin story of his high-pitched voice.\n\n\"Do you guys know who that was? Steve Buscemi is the voice of Starscream,\" director Josh Cooley announced after the video finished playing. \"First choice. We call him up and he says yes... I'm a huge Big Lebowski fan so this was a dream come true.\"\n\nTransformers One, the first-ever fully CG-animated Transformers movie, is an origin story that will reveal that Optimus Prime and Megatron were actually brothers-in-arms who first knew each other as Orion Pax and D-16, respectively, before they became bitter adversaries warring over the fate of their planet, Cybertron. The movie also stars Jon Hamm as Sentinel Prime and Laurence Fishburne as Alpha Trion.\n\nWant more movie news?

You're really going to get to know the robots in a way that nothing has been able to do before. You know Optimus and Megatron so well but we're dealing with Orion Pax and D-16. These guys are different but we still plant the seeds that get you to the characters you love.\"\n\n\"It's characters we know as enemies but seeing how they became enemies was fascinating to me,\" Cooley added. \"I've never seen this in any version of Transformers before.\"\n\nHenry said that the way Orion Pax and D-16 go from friends to enemies is \"heartbreaking.\"\n\n\"Losing a friend is one of the worst heartbreaks -- its worse than losing a lover,\" he said. \"A friendship is absolute family. I still think about the friends I lost in the third grade... To see that these two iconic characters actually had a friendship and lost it, to see what that was, it is heartbreaking.\"\n\nHemsworth was excited to take on his first major animation role, but understood the immense history and gravity of voicing a beloved character such as Optimus Prime.\n\n\"What Peter Cullen has done with the character is so incredible, iconic, and the thing that is equally inspiring as also terrifying when trying to play the character,\" he says. \"The goal was never to mimic or sound like Peter Cullen.

The panel, which IGN attended, revealed much about how the movie came together, including details on why it was picked to be animated instead of live-action and a first look at Steve Buscemi as Starscream. It also allowed cast members Keegan-Michael Key (Bumblebee), Brian Tyree Henry (Megatron), and Hemsworth to share what it's been like playing less experienced versions of characters fans have grown to love for decades.\n\nHemsworth, in particular, had big shoes to fill, as Optimus Prime has almost always been portrayed by the gentle but strong-voiced Cullen. The actor has helped Transformers become what it is today, but Transformers One takes place so early in the universe's timeline that the character goes by a different name: Orion Pax. Though filling in to play a young version of the Autobot hero came with its own stresses, Hemsworth wasn't concerned about emulating Cullen's work.\n\n\"What Peter Cullen has done with the character is so incredible, iconic - and the thing that's inspiring and terrifying about playing the character,\" he explains. \"The goal was never to mimic or sound like Peter Cullen. This is the brash young version of Orion Pax or Optimus Prime before he becomes the all-knowing figure we know.\"\n\nHe continues, saying that it was important to communicate \"youthfulness and humor\" when playing young versions of beloved characters. That meant offering new perspectives into what fans know while respecting what has come before. The one exception, Hemsworth adds, is toward the end of the film, where he did try to mix in a hint of Cullen's delivery.\n\nLater in the panel, when each cast member was asked who their favorite Transformer is, Hemsworth answered Bumblebee. Key, on the other hand, favors Soundwave, while Henry picked Ratchet.

He wasn't trying to imitate Peter Cullen, but he was doing the cadence and the rhythm of Optimus Prime, and I froze and I got goosebumps.\"", "source": {"uri": "wionews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WION"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Cooley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Cooley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transformers (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_di_Bonaventura", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo di Bonaventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Tyree_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Tyree Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transformers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Optimus Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Cullen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Cullen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/2024/07/25/445577-horizons-82.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759382", "eventUri": "eng-9759382", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Now, the Takara and Hasbro brand is teaming back up with an anime and trading card franchise that it united with last year.\n\nRevealed on social media by Takara Tomy and detailed on TFW2005, the new Transformers x Duel Masters collaboration is actually the second of its kind. Featuring cards based on Generation 1 versions of two iconic Autobots, the cards tie into both franchises well. The collaboration is also happening as both properties are celebrating major milestones in 2024.\n\nRelated\n\nTransformers' Legacy United Metalhawk Gets First Official Image Reveal for New Recolor\n\nA redeco of an obscure Autobot from the Transformers: Super-God Masterforce anime series is flying back onto shelves in the Transformers: Legacy line.\n\nThe Newest Duel Masters Cards Feature Optimus Prime and Bumblebee\n\nClose\n\nThe two new Transformers x Duel Masters cards feature the classic G1 versions of Optimus Prime and Bumblebee. In the case of both, the images on the cards seem to be derived from the Transformers: Missing Link figures. These toys are meant to update their classic G1 figures with modern articulation, although in the case of Bumblebee's card, his color scheme is now a shiny, sparkling gold (somewhat evoking Goldbug). Bumblebee is able to summon \"Commander Optimus Prime,\" who is shown in both his robot and semi-truck alternate mode, although the former has more attack/power points.\n\nThese cards are for the Duel Masters Play's digital trading card game, which has been running since 2019. August 2023 saw a similar set of physical cards made available as part of the Fabulous Art: Duema x TRANSFORMERS collaboration. These cards used imagery based on characters from the Generation 1 and Beast Wars iterations of the Transformers franchise, although the character choices were specifically based on the live-action movie Transformers: Rise of the Beasts. Sadly, the new collaboration, much like the game it's part of, is Japanese-exclusive, meaning that U.S. Transformers won't be able to roll out these cards into their digital deck anytime soon.\n\nRelated\n\nKodansha Reveals New Transformers Bumblebee Action Figure\n\nA preview for an upcoming Japanese Transformers action figure promises a remix of an existing Bumblebee toy with a shiny new color scheme.\n\nTransformers and Duel Masters Are Both Celebrating Major Anniversaries in 2024\n\n2024 is the 40th anniversary of Hasbro and Takara Tomy's Transformers brand, which was derived from figures originally released as part of the Diaclone franchise. Since then, the transforming Cybertronians have taken on a life of their own, with Optimus Prime and Bumblebee being just a few of the iconic characters within the property. To mark the occasion, several new toys, collaborations, comic books and other collectibles have been announced, with many of these 40th anniversary Transformers products highlighting the Japanese and anime ties of the robots in disguise.\n\nOn the other hand, Duel Masters debuted in 1999, making 2024 its 25th anniversary. Initially based on the Magic: The Gathering franchise, it took on a life of its own in Japan and became one of the many popular trading card game franchises alongside Pok\u00e9mon and the Yu-Gi-Oh! card game. It began as a manga series by Shigenobu Matsumoto before becoming an anime (with several seasons) and a trading card game. Along with these adaptations, the brand has also had numerous toys and video games. While its heyday has long since passed in the West (where it was quickly overtaken by other franchises), it's remained a popular series in Japan.\n\nTransformers\n\nTransformers is a media franchise produced by American toy company Hasbro and Japanese toy company Takara Tomy. It primarily follows the heroic Autobots and the villainous Decepticons, two alien robot factions at war that can transform into other forms, such as vehicles and animals.\n\nFirst Film

The panel, which IGN attended, revealed much about how the movie came together, including details on why it was picked to be animated instead of live-action and a first look at Steve Buscemi as Starscream. It also allowed cast members Keegan-Michael Key (Bumblebee), Brian Tyree Henry (Megatron), and Hemsworth to share what it's been like playing less experienced versions of characters fans have grown to love for decades.\n\nHemsworth, in particular, had big shoes to fill, as Optimus Prime has almost always been portrayed by the gentle but strong-voiced Cullen. The actor has helped Transformers become what it is today, but Transformers One takes place so early in the universe's timeline that the character goes by a different name: Orion Pax. Though filling in to play a young version of the Autobot hero came with its own stresses, Hemsworth wasn't concerned about emulating Cullen's work.\n\n\"The goal was never to mimic or sound like Peter Cullen.\n\n\"What Peter Cullen has done with the character is so incredible, iconic - and the thing that's inspiring and terrifying about playing the character,\" he explains. \"The goal was never to mimic or sound like Peter Cullen. This is the brash young version of Orion Pax or Optimus Prime before he becomes the all-knowing figure we know.\"\n\nHe continues, saying that it was important to communicate \"youthfulness and humor\" when playing young versions of beloved characters. That meant offering new perspectives into what fans know while respecting what has come before. The one exception, Hemsworth adds, is toward the end of the film, where he did try to mix in a hint of Cullen's delivery.\n\nLater in the panel, when each cast member was asked who their favorite Transformer is, Hemsworth answered Bumblebee. Key, on the other hand, favors Soundwave, while Henry picked Ratchet. We'll learn more about how each actor will portray new takes on classic alien heroes when Transformers One premieres September 20, 2024.\n\nMichael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

During the panel, the four discussed the upcoming movie. Those in attendance also got a peek at some clips on the upcoming movie as well.\n\nPrior to the trailer release, Lorenzo explained the movie and why it's an animated movie. \"The origin story, first of all, is incredibly rich,\" Lorenzo said. \"And it's something we've thought about for a long time. If we tried to do this in live-action it would probably cost $500 million.\"\n\nLorenzo explained the movie is entirely focused around the robots and won't have any human characters in it. After cheers from the crowd, Lorenzo jokingly yelled, \"Damn you humans!\"\n\nThe film follows Optimus Prime (Orion Pax in Transformers One) and Megatron (D-16), who are worker bots on Cybertron that can't transform. The duo go on an adventure to the surface of their planet, accompanied by other robots, and they gain the ability to transform. Of course, they don't know how to use their abilities right away. The group of four robots come together as well to fight other robots on the planet. It's a comedic and action-packed take on the long-running franchise about robots turning into cars, planes, and sometimes, planets.\n\nThe first trailer for the upcoming prequel was revealed back in April, giving fans a first look at the origin story of these Autobots in disguise.

The first animated reboot from director Josh Cooley (\"Toy Story 4\") explores the untold origin story of the Autobots on planet Cybertron before Michael Bay's post-apocalyptic live-action franchise. We learn about the early friendship between Orion Pax (Chris Hemsworth) and D-16 (Brian Tyree Henry) prior to becoming bitter enemies as the legendary Optimus Prime and infamous Megatron.\n\nOrion and D-16 are hard-working, frustrated miners, who drill underground for Energon (the source of energy storage and power generation) during a sustained drought. However, they dream of joining the elite team of Autobots led by Sentinel Prime (Jon Hamm). What Cooley brings to the franchise through animation is greater emotion, humor, and stylization, thanks to the talented team at ILM (led by VFX supervisor Frazer Churchill and animation supervisor Rob Coleman) and an appealing voice cast, which also includes Scarlett Johansson as Elita, the strict mining supervisor, and Keegan-Michael Key as motor mouth B-127/Bumblebee.\n\nCooley, who's had a personal connection to \"Transformers\" since childhood (when he played with the toys and watched the '80s animated series), immediately embraced the chance to explore the roots of the franchise in this story about political corruption, revolution, and war. He also found ILM the perfect animation partner because of their previous experience bringing photorealism to six of the seven live-action films (they also worked on \"Ultraman: Rising\").\n\n\"Scale has always been in the DNA of 'Transformers,' Cooley told IndieWire, \"and without humans in the film as scale reference, the massive world of Cybertron is in relation to our bots. The film being entirely animated allowed everything to be believably exaggerated to make the metal planet of Cybertron not only epic, but stunningly gorgeous.\"\n\nCooley, who was influenced by the look of the animated series, wanted a hand-made quality to the character designs with clear silhouettes. Human relatability was also important. For the robot ecosystem, production designer Jason William Scheier (the Emmy-nominated \"Blue Eye Samurai\") created a dark subterranean world where the robots are protected from alien attack in contrast to the more colorful surface, which resembles a New York-style metropolis with upside-down buildings, hanging stalactites, elegant robot deer.\n\nCooley told IndieWire at Annecy that he was influenced by such biblical epics as \"Ben-Hur\" and \"The Ten Commandments\" in telling his own epic story of two leaders with different world views, who inevitably clash. But \"Transformers One\" merely scratches the surface.\n\n\"I was coming up with so many ideas working on this; we'll have to see what happens next,\" added Cooley, who looks forward to the possibility of continuing the story of Optimus Prime and Megatron.", "source": {"uri": "indiewire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IndieWire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bill_desowitz@indiewire.com",

Here's a rundown of the most memorable moments from this event:\n\nThe film delves deep into the origins of Orion Pax and D-16, later known as Optimus Prime and Megatron. Driven by the staggering potential costs -- estimated around $500 million with real actors and sets -- the team opted for animation. This choice allows them to explore the characters in detail without budget constraints or human presence. Producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura set the film three billion years ago, giving key characters like Orion Pax and D-16 significant depth as they evolve into Optimus Prime and Megatron throughout the movie.\n\nSet three billion years in the past, the movie explores a time when the transformation cogs were absent from the characters, a twist that excited Cooley.\n\nMoreover, director Josh Cooley expressed his excitement about the project, noting that the unique script was a significant draw. Hasbro provided an extensive lore \"bible\" for the Transformers, comparable in length and detail to Tolkien's works, which gave Cooley ideas for the characters' backstories and depth to the story.\n\nAlso, Brian Tyree Henry discussed the nuanced portrayal of playing Megatron, emphasizing that they aren't inherently evil but are shaped by their stories. Chris Hemsworth, voicing a young Orion Pax, highlighted the captivating nature of the original cartoons and their subtle lessons in escapism. Keegan Michael-Key also expressed his love for the franchise by imitating the voices of characters -- especially Soundwave. At the same time, Josh mentioned his childhood fascination with the G1 cartoons and the toys, which influenced his approach.\n\nBrian Tyree Henry spoke about finding the heart in Megatron, drawing parallels to his work on Spider-Man. He emphasized that losing a friend, as depicted in the film, is a profoundly heartbreaking experience. Keegan-Michael Key, voicing B-127, aimed to capture the childlike essence of the character from the G1 cartoon, forcing his way into creating a new dynamic trio of Orion Pax, D-16, and B-127.\n\nThe panel concluded with the premiere of the new trailer, which you can now watch below!", "source": {"uri": "nerdreactor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nerd Reactor"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_pacis@nerdreactor.com", "name": "Mark Pacis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatron", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Megatron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Optimus Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Comic-Con"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transformers (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_di_Bonaventura", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo di Bonaventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Cooley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Cooley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Later this year, the new animated film Transformers One will flesh out that history and reveal where things went wrong for former friends turned bitter enemies, Optimus Prime and Megatron. Now, on the first day of Comic-Con, Paramount welcomed fans to Hall H with some exclusive clips from Transformers One.\n\nThe first clip featured Optimus and Megatron when they were still Orion Pax (Chris Hemsworth) and D-12 (Brian Tyree Henry). Orion arranged for himself and D-12 to watch a prestigious race on Cybertron. Sentinel Prime is treated like a celebrity by the crowd and it's mentioned that the Matrix of Leadership has been missing for 50 cycles, and energon is rare.\n\nOrion brashly enters himself and D-12 into the race even though they can't transform like the other contestants. They do well at first, but ultimately the pair have to shoot themselves out of a cannon in order to get third place. The fact that they're both miners makes them instant favorites with the crowd.\n\nThe second clip captured another pivotal moment from the past, as Orion, D-12, Elita (Scarlett Johansson), and B-127 (Keegan-Michael Key)--the future Bumblebee--are given the ability to transform by Alpha Trion (Laurence Fishburne). It changes their appearances so that they more closely resemble their classic look. Alpha Trion also covers their escape from enemy forces by transforming into a rhino-like beast and attacking their foes.\n\nThe four friends' first attempts to transform go badly in a very comical way. But they finally get it together and transform into Cybertronian vehicles and get away.\n\nFinally, a third clip revealed that Steve Buscemi is voicing Starscream, who was one of the Cybertronian High Guard along with Shockwave and Soundwave. Starscream mentions witnessing the fall of the Primes, and the four friends are their captives who have just been awakened. Starscream and D-12 get into a fight that quickly escalates into the latter's transformation into a giant gun. Only Orion is able to talk D-12 out of killing Starscream. And the future Megatron promises that this is the last time he will show mercy.\n\nTransformers One will hit theaters on September 20.", "source": {"uri": "gamespot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GameSpot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "blair_marnell@gamespot.com", "name": "Blair Marnell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Comic-Con"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transformers (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Optimus Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Pictures", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orion Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatron", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Megatron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decepticon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decepticon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autobot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Matrix (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Tyree_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian Tyree Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starscream", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starscream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Fishburne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laurence Fishburne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblebee_(Transformers)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bumblebee (Transformers)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Buscemi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Buscemi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_Johansson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scarlett Johansson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan-Michael_Key", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keegan-Michael Key"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Transformers_and_Inductors", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Transformers and Inductors", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Substation_and_Transmission", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Substation and Transmission", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Online", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Online", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/1837/18375603/4340552-transformersone.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759382", "eventUri": "eng-9759382", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-20", "textStart": 2404, "textEnd": 2416}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

Transformers One, an animated origin story, generated positive buzz after premiering as a work-in-progress at the Annency animation fest in June.\n\n\"Every indication we have from early screenings and tracking is that that movie is going to be a real fan favorite, with some nice legs in families,\" Cocks said. \"We think it will sell a lot of toys, as Transformers movies tend to have done.\"\n\nDespite the hype around Transformers One, this is a new corporate era for Hasbro. The company signaled as much by selling eOne to Lionsgate last year for $375 million, saying it would limit its investments in film and TV production and instead focus on gaming and consumer products, some with Hollywood ties. The quarterly results reflected that retreat, with entertainment revenue plunging 90% year-over-year to $18.8 million, but growth in other areas and cost reductions across the company drove better-than-expected financial results. Hasbro stock gained 6% in early trading after the quarterly report.\n\nTotal revenue dropped 18% compared with the year-ago period to $995.3 million, but the downturn was better than the 22% falloff expected by Wall Street analysts. Earnings per share, meanwhile, soared well past estimates, coming in at $1.22.\n\nOverall, the company has been making strides after a grueling stretch in 2023, when about 20% of the company's workforce was laid off due to economic headwinds and operational changes.\n\n\"We still have a bit of turnaround work to do on our core toy business,\" which has been buffeted by Covid, supply-chain issues, inflation and other factors, Cocks said. \"But I feel good about how we're getting our arms wrapped around that segment on the cost side. I think you're going to see that core toy business start to get to growth in the latter stages of Q3 and more decisively in Q4 and 2025.\"", "source": {"uri": "deadline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dade_hayes@deadline.com", "name": "Dade Hayes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transformers (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasbro", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hasbro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_story", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Origin story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionsgate", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lionsgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_One", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Transformers-1.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759382", "eventUri": "eng-9759382", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-20", "textStart": 372, "textEnd": 384}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

It showed a work-in-progress version at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival in June, while a fan screening hit Los Angeles earlier this week - so the panel was light on news.\n\nIt did, however, more than make up for that with the charm of its crowd-pleasing voice cast: Chris Hemsworth as Orion Pax, who will evolve into Optimus Prime; Brian Tyree Henry as D-16, who will turn into villainous Megatron; and Keegan-Michael Key, whose B-127 will become Bumblebee.\n\nThe trio were on stage with director Josh Cooley and longtime Transformers franchise producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura.\n\nKey had the crowd laughing by making Transformers sound effects and singing the classic theme song. And later, during the Q&A, a female guest directed her question to Key and Henry, throwing a casual \"And Chris, I guess,\" which generated much ribbing of the Australian superstar and became a running joke.\n\n\"Oh this is historic!\" howled Key.\n\nAnd even after the last question was posed, moderator Anthony Breznican called on one more audience member, a little boy. When told he could ask one question, the boy said \"I have seven.\"\n\nAlso helping win over the audience, which was already in a very receptive mood, were poster giveaways and a raffle to win a shiny electronic Matrix of Leadership prop that was autographed by the cast.\n\nEarlier, the actors noted how they played with the toys as children and shared their connections to the franchise.\n\n\"The nostalgia around it is something I hold dear to my heart,\" said Hemworth. \"The stories represented justice, injustice, right and wrong, the subtle lessons.\"\n\nHenry noted that his parents always seemed to get him villain characters, Transformers or otherwise. \"I would always make them the hero,\" he said of the toy characters. \"Villains don't always start (as villains). Something happens when they follow their righteousness to its final place. So being able to actually be Megatron is a lifelong dream come true.\"\n\nThat is fitting as the movie acts as an origin story to how Optimus Prime and Megatron become archenemies, with the movie, set three billion years before the stories audiences know, showing how the two best buds slowly grew apart.\n\nIt was the first time that Hemsorth has worked in animation, and he said it required a bit of trust in process.\n\n\"The way animation works is different from a film set where you're interacting, and doing things in the moment,\" he said. \"We would individually shoot our scenes. Luckily, we would see what each other had done and that would influence my performance ... You sort of hand it off and hope it gets to the right place.\"\n\nHenry, meanwhile, said the movie's story about the loss of a friendships would be relatable to broad audiences. Calling it one of the worst heartbreaks, he noted, \"The loss of a friend is something all of us can understand.\"\n\nSpeaking of friendly, Hemsworth stuck around briefly after the panel, shaking hands and signing autographs to the dozens that swarmed the stage area hoping for a close-up look at the star.\n\nParamount showed off three clips from the movie, which opens Sept. 20, and unveiled a new poster and trailer, the latter which can be viewed below.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri":

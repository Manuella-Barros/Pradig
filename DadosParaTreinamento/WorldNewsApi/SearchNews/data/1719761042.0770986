{"id": 225046248, "title": "Three-legged dog Flump looking for forever home after two years in Glasgow charity's care", "text": "A sweet-natured dog who has spent nearly two years in care is looking for his forever home. Flump, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier, is described as an 'underdog' due to the length of time he has spent at Dogs Trust Glasgow Rehoming Centre. Staff say they are flummoxed as to why Flump hasn't found his family. The eight-year-old pooch is described as having an affectionate and cuddly nature, despite having a difficult start in life. Earlier this year, Flump's right hind leg had to be amputated after suffering neglect prior to coming into the Dogs Trust's care. However, staff say this has not held him back and he has \"adapted brilliantly\" following the operation. They add that he is very clever and quick to learn new things.

Flump came into our care in August 2022. He had been neglected and had a damaged leg. Earlier this year, Flump had his right hind leg amputated due to this historic injury which had sadly deteriorated but this doesn\u2019t hold him back and he has adapted brilliantly to life on three legs. \u201cAs well as being a very loving, happy, lad, Flump is also very clever and loves to learn new things. The training team have spent lots of time with Flump which has paid off. He is an expert at responding to voice cues including going to bed, standing behind a gate and settling on command. Flump learns quickly and we are keen that his training continues in his new home.

Flump is such a beautiful boy both inside and out and we encourage anyone looking to share their life with a loving and loyal dog to come and meet our fabulous Flump.\u201d Although super friendly with people, Flump feels overwhelmed around other dogs so requires an adult only home where he is the only pet and with no neighbouring dogs. He would also enjoy being exercised in dog free areas where he can relish relaxing walks. A secure garden space would ensure Flump is one very happy boy.

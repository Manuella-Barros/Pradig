The tokens, which feature crudely drawn images of the candidates, have exploded in popularity since launch. The Joe Biden themed token is called Jeo Boden (BODEN), while the Trump themed token is called Doland Tremp (TREMP).\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe tokens have sported gains to the magnitude of hundreds of thousands of percent, going from a small fraction of a cent to nearly $1. These gains were furthered when former president Donald Trump directly acknowledged the memecoins.\n\nTrump met with supporters at an NFT event in Mar-a-Lago, where those who bought more than 47 of the $99 each NFTs could meet with the former president directly. One of the supporters asked Trump about BODEN, saying that \"there's a token that has been released making fun of Joe Bidem, and it's worth $240 million. I don't know if you are aware of that\".\n\nTrump responded saying, \"that's a lot of money for a coin. I don't like that investment\".\n\nThe price of the both tokens became much more volatile shortly after the audio was posted on X. The price of BODEN jumped from $0.35 to nearly $0.45 within an hour. However, the price has since fallen back to around $0.35.\n\nTrending: Large boom in cryptocurrency and metaverse interest as BTC skyrockets -- has Apple Vision Pro increased the demand for virtual real estate?\n\nThe price of TREMP, on the other hand, has seen enormous gains since the post. Moments before the post, TREMP was trading for less than $0.30, but immediately gained over 100%, trading as high as $0.61 within an hour. Overnight, the price continued to climb, reaching a high of $0.91. This marked total gains of over 200% within seven hours.\n\nThis inevitably led to many investors taking profit, and the price of TREMP retraced to around $0.75. However, it is still up more than 170% in the past 24 hours. However, the market cap of TREMP is still less than that of BODEN. TREMP is worth around $70 million, while BODEN is still worth $240 million.\n\nOne user commented on the post saying, \"is this real life\", to which the official \"wallstreetbets\" account responded, \"is life real\". In total, the post has received over 550,000 views in less than 24 hours.\n\nAdditionally, some believe that the wording of the question made it seem as though each token was worth $240 million, instead of the entire project. If this is how Trump interpreted the question, it could have influenced his answer. Regardless, the comments have brought significant attention to the tokens.\n\nThe comments from Trump are extremely surprising and not something that many saw coming. The projects have mostly been popular with those inside the crypto community and have not made much noise outside of that. However, Trump's comment could bring about even more attention from those outside of crypto.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

They described it to him and explained it had a market capitalization of $240 million.\n\nTrump responded to this person by saying that he doesn't \"like that investment.\" Considering the meme nature of the token, it makes sense that any comment from Trump would spark an interest in it.\n\nWith Trump's comments comes an increase in trading of the BODEN crypto. This trading volume up 67.9% over the prior 24-hour period. That's also resulted in the price of the crypto surging 21.4% higher as of this writing.\n\nInvestors will note that Jeo Boden isn't the only meme crypto created to capitalize on 2024 being an election year. Opposite of it is Doland Tremp (TREMP-USD). This is another meme token mimicking Donald Trump's name.\n\nDoland Tremp doesn't have as high of a market capitalization as Jeo Boden at roughly $71.5 million. However, it's still rallying today with a 181.1% gain over the last 24-hours. That comes alongside a 1,219% increase in trading volume.\n\nOne area that TREMP does beat BODEN in is price.

According to a recent Coindesk report, when asked about BODEN, which had a reported market capitalization of $240 million, Trump simply stated:\n\nI don't like that investment.\n\nDespite the less-than-stellar endorsement, BODEN's value skyrocketed by as much as 25% following Trump's comment. This event showcases the power of publicity, even in its most lackluster form, when it comes to memecoins and other speculative investments in the cryptocurrency market. Still, as of press time BODEN fell back down to $0.3208 with a market cap of $221 million according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nDuring the impromptu Q&A session, Trump was also asked about whether his presidential campaign would be accepting cryptocurrency donations. Although his campaign is not currently accepting digital asset donations, the presidential candidate reassured the audience that he would make sure it becomes an option in the future.\n\nOn Polymarket, a crypto-based prediction market platform, the contract \"Will Trump mention $BODEN before July?\" remained relatively unchanged following the event. The contract defines a \"mention\" as either a verbal or written usage of the word \"boden\" specifically in reference to the cryptocurrency. Trump's brief comment did not meet the criteria, and predicted odds of him mentioning BODEN by July 1 remain low at just 4%.\n\nCrypto as a topic is becoming less and less rare in the discussions surrounding the presidential candidates.

The tokens, which feature crudely drawn images of the candidates, have exploded in popularity since launch. The Joe Biden themed token is called Jeo Boden (BODEN), while the Trump themed token is called Doland Tremp (TREMP).\n\nThe tokens have sported gains to the magnitude of hundreds of thousands of percent, going from a small fraction of a cent to nearly $1. These gains were furthered when former president Donald Trump directly acknowledged the memecoins.\n\nTrump met with supporters at an NFT event in Mar-a-Lago, where those who bought more than 47 of the $99 each NFTs could meet with the former president directly. One of the supporters asked Trump about BODEN, saying that \"there's a token that has been released making fun of Joe Bidem, and it's worth $240 million. I don't know if you are aware of that\".\n\nTrump responded saying, \"that's a lot of money for a coin. I don't like that investment\".\n\nThe price of the both tokens became much more volatile shortly after the audio was posted on X. The price of BODEN jumped from $0.35 to nearly $0.45 within an hour. However, the price has since fallen back to around $0.35.\n\nTrending: Large boom in cryptocurrency and metaverse interest as BTC skyrockets -- has Apple Vision Pro increased the demand for virtual real estate?\n\nThe price of TREMP, on the other hand, has seen enormous gains since the post. Moments before the post, TREMP was trading for less than $0.30, but immediately gained over 100%, trading as high as $0.61 within an hour. Overnight, the price continued to climb, reaching a high of $0.91. This marked total gains of over 200% within seven hours.\n\nThis inevitably led to many investors taking profit, and the price of TREMP retraced to around $0.75. However, it is still up more than 170% in the past 24 hours. However, the market cap of TREMP is still less than that of BODEN. TREMP is worth around $70 million, while BODEN is still worth $240 million.\n\nOne user commented on the post saying, \"is this real life\", to which the official \"wallstreetbets\" account responded, \"is life real\". In total, the post has received over 550,000 views in less than 24 hours.\n\nAdditionally, some believe that the wording of the question made it seem as though each token was worth $240 million, instead of the entire project. If this is how Trump interpreted the question, it could have influenced his answer. Regardless, the comments have brought significant attention to the tokens.\n\nThe comments from Trump are extremely surprising and not something that many saw coming. The projects have mostly been popular with those inside the crypto community and have not made much noise outside of that. However, Trump's comment could bring about even more attention from those outside of crypto.", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boden,_Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boden, Sweden"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremp", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tremp"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tremp"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Non-fungible token"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solana_(blockchain_platform)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solana (blockchain platform)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Coins", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Coins", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Laser_Games/Zone_Empire", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Laser Games/Zone Empire", "wgt": 7}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPEDAC13D_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553964", "eventUri": "eng-9553964", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

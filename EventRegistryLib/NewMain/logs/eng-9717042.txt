He knew exactly how he wanted something. He was seeing it a certain way and was able to precisely convey that to us. It helps that he is a guy with whom work feels like work of passion.

(Image courtesy Zee5)\n\nHar sawaal ka jawaab science ke paas nahi hota (Science doesn't have the answers for all questions),\" ghost hunter Victor James (Riteish Deshmukh) tells a newly married Sonakshi Sinha in horror-comedy Kakuda on Zee5.\n\nIt's still early in the film at this point. Sonakshi Sinha plays Indira (Indu for short), a fairly modern girl with an ancient problem. She is at the hospital with her new husband Sunny (Saqib Saleem) who's been cursed by the local ghost of Ratauri village: Kakuda.\n\nThe last time we saw Riteish Deshmukh in a movie, he was playing the bearded and brooding Ved in the Marathi film of the same name. In Kakuda, we see Deshmukh in a role that uses his comedy chops with a bit of charm and restraint.\n\nThis is also Sonakshi Sinha's first film to release since her wedding on June 23. And it comes on the heels of her success in Heeramandi (Netflix). Interestingly, she has a double role in Kakuda as well.\n\nKakuda finds its comic moments in the crevasses of what reads like a cautionary tale derived from Indian folklore: a remote village where a ghoul curses those who fail to honour and welcome him by leaving a tiny door open, could be the stuff of a Vijaydan Detha story.\n\nWhere the movie drags a bit is in the \"horror\" sequences. The ghoul of Ratauri is foul and fly-infested, but he is rarely scary (the film is rated 16+). To be sure, everyone has their own tolerance levels for spooks and spookiness. But if you can watch a bit of horror for fun, there's nothing to make you jump out of your skin here - far from it.\n\nKakuda movie review\n\nThough not new, horror comedy films have lately found a loyal audience in India. There are enough examples of commercial and OTT successes from Bollywood, including Bhool Bhulaiya, Stree and now Munjya. But equally there are examples of films that have been lacklustre at the box office. Case in point: Phone Bhoot and Bhediya.\n\nKakuda is directed by Aditya Sarpotdar who also made Munjya - which entered the 100 Crore Club after four weeks in theatres. The story pits the rational mind against an emotional bhoot, with an almost obsequious ghost hunter mediating with his devices to tell humans and ghosts apart as well as capture audio frequencies of ghosts and translate them\n\nKakuda movie plot\n\nKakuda, which released direct-to-digital on Zee5 on July 11, is the latest in a growing line of horror comedies that dip into India's folk tales for inspiration. Indeed, the movie begins in a way that is reminiscent of the stories of GOAT writers like Rajasthani folklorist Vijaydan Detha. Here's how it goes: An elderly gentleman gets off a state transport bus in the middle of nowhere. The conductor is surprised, as he takes the man's luggage down. He wasn't aware there was even a village around here. The name of the village, we learn, is Ratauri, and the people here have a peculiar custom: Every Tuesday, at 7.15pm, they must shut the main door of the home and open a smaller door built especially for Kakuda. Failing to do this brings Kakuda's curse upon a male member of the house. This cursed individual develops a hump, and dies within 13 days.\n\nGhost hunter Victor (Riteish Deshmukh) and newly wed Indu/Indira (Sonakshi Sinha) team up when the curse of Kakuda falls upon Indu's new husband Sunny (Saqib Saleem).\n\nKakuda performances\n\nWhile Riteish Deshmukh as ghost hunter Victor and Asif Khan as Sunny's nervous friend Qilbil steal the show, everyone plays their part well in Kakuda.\n\nKakuda director and writer\n\nKakuda is directed by Aditya Sarpotdar and written by Avinash Dwivedi and Chirag Garg.\n\nKakuda trailer\n\nThe trailer explains the premise, and introduces the main characters.

I can only say what are the three things in my relationship on which I concentrate. I feel that in a relationship couple of things that are very important and prime most is respect.\n\n\"If you respect your partner immaterial of anything. That respect should be there even when you are arguing. Because when you argue, there is a time when it slips. And then you start disrespecting. Once it comes, that crack, it is always visible.\n\n\"So be very careful. It's like a broken plate, you stick it together. Even then, you see the crack. That's why do not lose respect. If you think that you are going to say something because of which things can worse then be quiet. So one is respect.\n\n\"Second is the needs of your partner should be above your needs. It's not what you want. Her needs should be above yours. These two things if you follow. And have a sense of humour.\"\n\nIMAGE: Ritiesh Deshmukh in Kakuda.\n\nMeanwhile, Riteish is all set to enthral the audience with a never-seen-before avatar in the horror comedy Kakuda.\n\nTalking about his character Victor, a ghost hunter in the film, Riteish said, \"I think, first of all, when we think of a ghost hunter, we think of him as someone who can chant a mantra. But Aditya (Director Aditya Sarpotdar) had visualised in such a way that he wanted to make it very cool, very edgy.\n\n\"Because in such a village, a strange character has come. A ghost hunter named Victor. He might be the first person in the village named Victor. There are tattoos, hair, there's a scar. So there are a lot of things. And he has a weird machine. Because of which he tries to catch the ghost. And he's quite a weird guy.\n\n\"And it was exciting to play because I had not played something like this before. And in such a space. It's a bit weird.

He knew exactly how he wanted something. He was seeing it a certain way and was able to precisely convey that to us. It helps that he is a guy with whom work feels like a work of passion.

However, for many years this door seemed closed but with 2018's Stree, Maddock Films brought back the genre of horror-comedy in India. Moreover, when big-budget films like Bade Miyan Chote Miyan and Maidaan struggled at the box office, another repugnance movie Munjya became a super-duper hit. Now the makers are back with another horror-comedy film Kakuda which has been released on Zee5 today.\n\nStory\n\nStarring Sonakshi Sinha, Ritesh Deshmukh and Saqib Saleem in lead roles, Kakuda is based on an old folklore about a ghost called by the same name. Ritesh plays the role of a ghost hunter, who has freed 127 witches, 72 vampires, 37 ghosts and 3 jinns in his illustrious career. The film begins with a village named Ratauli, whose residents are troubled because of a ghost named Kakuda. The spirit rises on a particular day and at a particular time of the week, and just demands respect from its people. The ones who fail to do so are presented with uncertain deaths within 13 days. Moreover, the only thing to do to give respect to Kakuda is to open the small door of your house for him at a particular time.\n\nThings turn serious when one day Sunny ( played by Saqib Saleem) forgets to add to the respect of Kakuda and becomes his victim. His wife Indira (played by Sonakshi Sinha) looks for a ghost hunter ( played by Riteish Deshmukh) to save him. To know whether he's able to save Sunny and the villagers, you should watch the film streaming now on Zee5.\n\nDirection\n\nThe film has been directed by Aditya Sarpotdar, who made hit horror comedies like Munjya and Zombivli. However, the filmmaker has failed to bring the tightness of Munjya in this film. Throughout the film, the director and writers Avinash Dwivedi, and Chirag Garg seem to be trying to copy Stree and Bhediya. The script is actually the weakest part of Kakuda and clearly needed improvisation. At places, Kakuda also seems to be a spoof of Stree.

(LatestLY Exclusive) | \ud83c\udfa5 LatestLY", "body": "Kakuda Movie Review: Those who have watched director Aditya Sarpotdar's blockbuster Munjya would be aware that the film is set in the Stree Universe. Well, his new film Kakuda, which has been in the cans for some time, could also have fit quite well in the same cinematic universe. There is a cursed village where a spirit troubles the villagers who don't meet its strange condition. There are a couple of sprightly actors with good comic timing who could have bonded well with Vicky and co. I mean, who wouldn't want to see a horror-comedy where Riteish Deshmukh shares the screen with Rajkummar Rao and Varun Dhawan? OTT Releases of the Week: Riteish Deshmukh-Sonakshi Sinha's 'Kakuda', Japanese Reality Dating Show 'The Boyfriend' on Netflix & More.\n\nHowever, the fact that Kakuda feels so entrenched in Stree territory also makes it formulaic and unmemorable despite its mix of campy horror and comedy. The events of the film are set in the village of Rathodi, which has a unique curse. Every house in the village has a small door next to its usual larger one, and the male resident of the house has to leave that door open at 7:15 pm every Tuesday evening. That's the time when the evil spirit Kakuda visits the village.\n\nIf the door is not opened at the precise time, Kakuda attacks the male resident and leaves a lump on his back. Then, on the 13th day after getting that bump, the victim dies. How Kakuda chooses which male member to attack if the family has more than one man is never answered. Nor is it explained what happens if the family is out of town. Will the spirit catch a bus to the new location and then curse the male?\n\nAnyway, the latest victim of the curse is Sunny (Saqib Saleem), who misses the deadly deadline while secretly getting married to his girlfriend Indira (Sonakshi Sinha). Indira doesn't believe he is cursed and thinks the bump on his back is the result of some plague. However, when the bump returns after it is operated upon, Indira has to accept that something paranormal is going on. Conveniently, she also encounters Victor (Riteish Deshmukh), a ghost hunter who offers his services to exorcise Kakuda. Together, they have to figure out who Kakuda is and why his curse works the way it does before Sunny's time runs out.\n\nIf you loved Stree and Munjya, there's a chance you might be okay with Kakuda. Even if the film comes across as that weak cousin everyone seems to ignore at any party, it is funny, mostly because actors like Riteish (who felt a bit too restrained for his role), Sonakshi, Saqib, and Aasif Khan (who plays Sunny's BFF Kilvish) have good comic timing.\n\nThe plot setting feels familiar but still has an engaging quality to it, particularly with Victor's entry and when the protagonists investigate the mystery. The scene where Indira's uncle and aunt try to convince a cursed Sunny to let his wife marry someone healthy is quite funny -- though not his antics after that...\n\nThe trouble comes when Kakuda doesn't know whether it wants to be a spoof comedy (as the trailer declared it to be) or a horror-comedy. For a spoof comedy, it takes itself a little too seriously, and for a horror-comedy, it doesn't take things seriously enough. The film just places itself in a weird, confused zone in between.\n\nA prime example of this is how Kakuda treats the mortality of the ghost's victims. The death hanging over the heads of the cursed victims is treated with amusement both by the film and the characters within it -- which fits in with the light-hearted vibe of the movie. But when it wants to take the impending doom of a major character gravely, it is hard to do so when we know things are going to end well. Some of the humour even takes playful digs at Bollywood's previous horror comedies like Stree and Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, and then the film goes on to stick to the same tropes that the other movies worked on.\n\nThe ghost itself is hardly a standout character, unlike the terrifying 'Stree' or the mischievous 'Munjya' - a CGI-created entity that doesn't feel spooky once the proper reveal is shown. Its backstory and the unique characteristic of its curse are mildly fascinating but not engaging enough to draw you in. Also, I am not a fan of the revelation that Indira has a twin sister and her conveniently close connection to the spirit. More than being a vital component of the narrative, she felt more like a way for the film to give Victor a potential love interest. Munjya Movie Review: Humour and Horror Come in Half-Measures in Abhay Verma and Sharvari Wagh's Supernatural Comedy.\n\nThe third act of Kakuda is also quite a letdown, more so because it adheres closely to now-formulaic third-act horror tropes -- female characters being possessed, a last-minute twist. The film ends with a lazy cliffhanger teasing a potential sequel, which we know will never happen.\n\nKakuda struggles to carve out its identity amidst the shadows of its predecessors like Stree and Munjya. While it has a promising premise and a talented cast, the film's indecisive tone and reliance on formulaic tropes undermine its potential.

Following her role in Netflix's period drama Heeramandi, Sonakshi Sinha ventures into a different genre with this much-anticipated film. Here's everything you need to know about Kakuda as its release date approaches.\n\nWhat is ZEE5's Kakuda's release date?\n\nFor those eagerly waiting, Sonakshi Sinha's Kakuda is gearing up to premiere on July 12, 2024, only on ZEE5. The story, as shown in the trailer, revolves around Sunny, portrayed by Saqib Saleem, who starts a new life with his newlywed wife, Indira, played by Sonakshi Sinha.\n\nThe trailer opens with the introduction of the haunted village of Ratodi, where every house has two doors: one large and one small. The smaller door is meant for a ghost named Kakuda, and it needs to be opened at precisely 7:15 p.m. If not followed, the head of the household gets cursed.\n\nOn the newlywed couple's first night, Sunny forgets to open the door, which ultimately leads to the mysterious ghost putting a curse on him. The curse causes a hump to grow on the back, leading to their death on the thirteenth day.\n\nTo prevent this, practical Indira, who does not believe in superstitions, seeks help from an eccentric ghost hunter named Victor Jacobs (played by Riteish Deshmukh). What follows is something viewers will see after its release on Friday.\n\nApart from Sinha, Saleem, and Deshmukh, Kakuda's stellar cast also includes Panchayat's Aasif Khan, Sachin Vidrohi, and Ravi Ranjan. Hemant Singh, Garrvil Mohan, Arun Dubey, Magan Luhar, and Suraj Raj Madhwani round out the main cast. Furthermore, the title Kakuda has piqued fans' curiosity. In Sanskrit, it refers to the hump on an Indian bull's shoulders, which ties into the curse of the ghost.\n\nAs the release date approaches, fans eagerly await to see Sonakshi Sinha, Riteish Deshmukh, and Saqib Saleem bring this quirky tale to life.

I can only say what are the three things in my relationship on which I concentrate. I feel that in a relationship couple of things that are very important and prime most is respect. If you respect your partner immaterial of anything. That respect should be there even when you are arguing. Because when you argue, there is a time when it slips. And then you start disrespecting.

Still, unfortunately, the genre of folklore didn't get explored until the arrival of recent movies like Stree, Bhediya and Munjya which garnered love from the audience and box office.\n\nDirector Aditya Sarpotdar, who is known for making Zombivli and Munjya, has come up with another folklore story in the form of Kakuda. While the trailer seems to hit the right chord does it manage the audience's heart? Let's find out&mldr;\n\nThe story revolves in Rathodi village, which is cursed by Kakuda (a dwarf ghost). Every house in the village has two doors with one being normal and another being small. On every Tuesday, Kakuda comes into the village at 7: 15 pm and if he sees that a small door is not open for him, he enters that house and kicks a man residing there following which that person gets a hump and dies after 13 days.\n\nSunny (Saqib Saleem), who is a resident of Rathodi, loves Indira (Sonakshi Sinha) from another village. However, Indira's father rejects Sunny as he can't speak English. Later, they both plan to elope and marry but Sunny's friend suggests that the day they are choosing is Tuesday and he needs to make sure that by 7: 15 the small door should be open or he will be kicked by Kakuda.\n\nWith all the apprehensions and hesitation, Sunny agrees for Tuesday and he and Indira marry in hush-hush. However, he gets late to open the small door and gets a hump on his back after a kick from Kakuda.\n\nThe next day Indira arrives at Sunny residence and is shocked to see him with a hump. She thinks it is a normal disease lump and takes him to the hospital for surgery. While the surgery is successful, the next day the lump again comes on his back, which makes Indira realize that the village is actually cursed by Kakuda.\n\nNow, Indira has 13 days in her hand to save Sunny and while battling with situations, she comes across Victor Jacobs (Riteish Deshmukh), a ghost hunter and paranormal investigation expert. Indira and Victor come together to learn the details about Kakuda and they discover the tragic story of how a dwarf named Gullak, who used to work in Goyal circus, became Kakuda.\n\nBut how will Indira save Sunny from death and will Victor make Rathodi curse free from Kakuda? Well, for that you need to watch this film.\n\nDirector Sarpotdar, who recently enjoyed box-office success with Munjya , failed to write an engaging screenplay marred by predictability. It gives you a Stree hangover but fails on the entertainment quotient.\n\nTalking about the performances, Sonakshi Sinha and Saqib Saleem fit the bill perfectly but it is Riteish Deshmukh, who makes the movie watchable with his impeccable comic timing and some hilarious punches.

In an interview recently, he spoke about the film taking a possible dig at previous successful horror-comedies like 'Stree' and 'Bhool Bhulaiyaa'. The actor is joined by Sonakshi Sinha and Saqib Saleem in the Aditya Sarpotdar-directorial. As shown in the trailer which was released last week, Riteish plays the role of 'videshi tantrik', a ghost hunter.\n\nWhile speaking to Zoom, he denied the reports claiming that 'Kakuda' mocks 'Stree' or any other horror-comedy film. He said filmmakers usually take references from good films, and it is the same case here. \"There is a dialogue in the film \"Bhooton se dar nhi lgta insaan se lagta hai'. That's not a dig at 'Dabangg' or at Sonakshi's line, but it's an ode to that film,\" he said.\n\nThe popular actor also spoke about his reason for working in 'Kakuda'. Riteish said that it was the simplicity of the story that drew him towards the film. \"I think the script was very interesting. It is a horror-comedy, but it is not just about scares and laughs. It is a story that has a lot of heart, and it is about the relationships between the characters (sic),\" he added.\n\n'Kakuda' is set in a fictional haunted village called Ratodi, where each house has two doors: one big and one small. The smaller door is for a ghost named Kakuda. The film is a love story where Saqib's Sunny falls in love with Sonakshi's Indira. However, the curse of Kakuda turns their lives upside down. That's when Victor, the ghost hunter, enters the play and helps Indira to save her husband's life.\n\nThis is Aditya's first outing after the massive success of 'Munjya' which was released in June this year and became a box office blockbuster. 'Kakuda' is also Sonakshi's first film after her wedding with Zaheer Iqbal.

While there are hardly any chills, it does provide some laughs, thanks to the quirky dialogues and performances of the actors.\n\nThe plot is straight out of folklore where villagers have constructed a shorter door on their entrance and wait for a ghost 'Kakuda' every Tuesday evening. If this supernatural creature finds a door shut, he kicks a man from the family, leaving them with a bulge on his back, and only 13 days to live.\n\nIndira (Sonakshi Sinha) and Sunny (Saqib Saleem)play a couple in love, fighting to get married. The major obstruction - Indira's father wants an English-speaking son-in-law. As Saqib's character fails the language test, the two decide to elope. On the day of their marriage, Sunny is late to reach home and thus faces the wrath of Kakuda. While he awaits his death, his newlywed bride decides to take charge and save her husband, just like the story of Savitri and Yamraj.\n\nEnter ghost hunter Victor (Riteish Deshmukh), who also plays Cupid for departed souls. With the power to use charcoal painting to decipher the unfulfilled desires of souls, he helps them to attain salvation. Along with Indira, he gets on the journey to solve the case. They are also joined by the couple's friend Kilvish (Aasif Khan), who although jitters at the thought of a ghost, puts up a brave front for his friends.\n\nThrough a series of misadventures, failed attempts, and confrontations with the spirit, the team finally manages to unravel the mystery. But, will they manage to save Sunny? That's for you to watch. Also, Sonakshi has a surprise for fans, but we are not giving away any spoilers.\n\nRiteish Deshmukh steals the show as the extremely cool, new-age tantrik. We have all been fans of his comic timing, and he proves his mettle once again by pulling the film through with his humour. Sonakshi Sinha is also pleasant and gets to tap on many shades in this part. Having seen her play strong roles in 'Dahaad' and 'Heeramandi', one might miss her powerful stance and attitude though. Saqib Saleem and Aasif Khan are sincere but do not have a lot to contribute.\n\nNone of the songs are worth remembering and were actually skipped by us while watching the film. The biggest highlight, however, is how the makers used animation to show the backstory of Kakuda. It was refreshing and added a new dynamic to the storytelling process. The VFX and background score also add strength to the narration.\n\nDirector Aditya Sarpotdar, fresh from the success of 'Munjya', does a fairly good job with 'Kakuda' too. He seems to understand the genre and folk tales, making his storytelling process quite engaging. The story, screenplay, and dialogues are by Avinash Dwivedi and Chirag Garg, both actors themselves. The story is quite a winner, but their screenplay could have been tighter. Dialogues, on the other hand, have also been elevated, thanks to the actors who added the punch and kick with their timing.\n\nHowever, they did manage to grasp the nerves of rural India - be it Indira's father's desire to have an English-speaking damaad, or Sunny's father helplessly waiting for his son's death without giving a fight because of their blind beliefs. The mystery behind Kakuda is also a heartening one, given how society has still not come to fully accept the differently-abled. The 'ghost' has been given quite a well-prosthetic look, but we wish the film also had more jump scares. It ended up more like a comedy film with horror just for its namesake.\n\nYou can watch it over the weekend at home if rain spoils your plans.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saqib_Saleem", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saqib Saleem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riteish_Deshmukh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riteish Deshmukh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonakshi_Sinha", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sonakshi Sinha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakuda,_Miyagi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kakuda, Miyagi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kakuda, Miyagi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhediya_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bhediya (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Folklore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supernatural"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mystery film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savitri_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Savitri (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New-age_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New-age music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cupid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantra", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tantra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahaad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dahaad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aditya_Sarpotdar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aditya Sarpotdar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avinash", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Avinash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedy film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_effects", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Visual effects"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film score"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Screenplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202407/riteish-deshmukh--sonakshi-sinha-and-saqib-saleems-kakuda-releases-on-july-12-114441148-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=txFQBg3h7OsTHREE3XPOIJr6RWsRJmLG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717042", "eventUri": "eng-9717042", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

While ghost films often embrace absurdity, director Aditya Sarpotdar's 'Kakuda', written by Avinash Dwivedi and Chirag Garg, reaches new heights of incoherence. Ratodi, a small town in Mathura, is tormented by the ghost of a dwarf clown named Kakuda. Every Tuesday, Kakuda's spirit preys on the men of the village. The only way to avoid his curse is by leaving a small window-like door open in their homes. Failure to comply results in deadly consequences.\n\nSunny (Saqib Saleem) and his father have managed to escape the curse so far, but on one ill-fated Tuesday, everything changes. On the evening of his wedding to Indira (Sonakshi Sinha), Sunny returns home late and falls victim to Kakuda's curse. He is doomed to die on the thirteenth day, with a hump on his back. Refusing to believe in superstitions, Indira takes matters into her own hands by involving a ghost hunter named Victor (Riteish Deshmukh). But will Victor's ghost-busting methods save Sunny from an untimely demise?\n\nThe execution and treatment of Kakuda are so juvenile that there's never a moment when Sunny's life feels genuinely threatened. Sarpotdar fails to evoke a sense of fear or concern for any of the characters. The plot, besides being ludicrous and outlandish, is also unconvincing. While the story follows a similar pattern as 'Stree', this one lacks the humour and finesse needed to make such a premise work. The writing fails to make us connect with any of the characters or take their life-threatening predicament seriously. The humor feels forced, and the comedy is virtually non-existent. None of the jokes land, and apart from a few lines delivered by Sunny's best friend Kilvish (Aasif Khan), the rest don't even elicit a chuckle from the audience. The only redeeming feature of the film is its main villain. Kakuda's appearance carries an element of eerie mystery. Sarpotdar manages to create a spooky atmosphere whenever Kakuda comes calling. However, the characters' reactions, who are supposed to be terrified of him, come across as confused and fail to convince us to take the events seriously. Kakuda's backstory and motivations have some depth but lack overall conviction.\n\nDespite the film's mediocre writing, Sonakshi Sinha delivers a decent performance. Her character is the only one that makes some sense. It's hard to empathise with Saqib Saleem's character, despite his impending death in the plot. Riteish Deshmukh is reduced to playing a caricatured ghostbuster, sporting multiple tattoos and kohl-lined eyes. An actor of his talent is wasted in a poorly written role.\n\nOverall, \"Kakuda' fails to either scare or amuse. This in itself is a good reason to give this campy horror-comedy a miss.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ronak_kotecha@timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "name": "Ronak Kotecha", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakuda,_Miyagi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kakuda, Miyagi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kakuda, Miyagi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avinash", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avinash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarfism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dwarfism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathura", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mathura"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mathura"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saqib_Saleem", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saqib Saleem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riteish_Deshmukh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riteish Deshmukh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonakshi_Sinha", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sonakshi Sinha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superstition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_horror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedy horror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mystery film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_(style)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Camp (style)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tattoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-111630018/Kakuda.jpg?111630018", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717042", "eventUri": "eng-9717042", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

I can only say what are the three things in my relationship on which I concentrate. I feel that in a relationship couple of things that are very important and prime most is respect. If you respect your partner immaterial of anything. That respect should be there even when you are arguing. Because when you argue, there is a time when it slips. And then you start disrespecting. Once it comes, that crack, it is always visible. So be very careful. It's like a broken plate, you stick it together. Even then, you see the crack. That's why do not lose respect. If you think that you are going to say something because of which things can worse then be quiet. So one is respect. Second is the needs of your partner should be above your needs. It's not what you want. Her needs should be above yours. These two things if you follow. And have a sense of humour.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Riteish Deshmukh is all set to enthral the audience with his never-seen-before avatar in the upcoming horror comedy film 'Kakuda'.\n\nTalking about his character Victor, a ghost hunter in the film, Riteish said, \"I think, first of all, when we think of a ghost hunter, we think of him as someone who can chant a mantra. But Aditya had visualized in such a way that he wanted to make it very cool, very edgy. Because in such a village, a strange character has come. A ghost hunter named Victor. He might be the first person in the village named Victor. There are tattoos, hair, there's a scar. So there are a lot of things. And he has a weird machine. Because of which he tries to catch the ghost. And he's quite a weird guy. And it was exciting to play because I had not played something like this before. And in such a space. It's a bit weird. But when everyone gets together and everyone's problem is solved then it's quite a teamwork.\"\n\n'Kakuda' follows the story of Sunny played by Saqib Saleem, a less-educated guy who is in love with Indira portrayed by Sonakshi Sinha. Determined to be together, they marry and move to the village of Ratodi only to be cursed by 'Kakuda'. On their wedding night, Sunny fails to open the smaller door for Kakuda at 7:15 pm sharp, inviting Kakuda, a wicked ghost who punishes the man of the house by inflicting a hump on their back that grows until their demise on the thirteenth day. With Sunny's life hanging by a thread, Indira seeks help from Victor, an eccentric ghost hunter played by Riteish Deshmukh.\n\nTogether, they embark on a freakishly hilarious yet spooky journey to solve the mystery of Kakuda, and uncover the shocking truth about the ghost's identity, motives, and the village's haunting curse that has lasted for decades.\n\n'Kakuda', which is directed by Aditya Sarpotdar, will be out on ZEE5 on July 12.

It seems a bit callous about violent death (a father rehearses his son's funeral!)\n\nIn a north Indian village of Ratodi, where a skeleton serves as a scarecrow, houses have a peculiar architectural feature: A small door next to the main entrance.\n\nIf a male resident of a household does not open that small door by 7.15 pm, he develops a hump, and dies 13 days later, believed to be killed by the curse of heavy-breathing Chucky-like mini monster (Mahesh Jadhav). So men rush back home to make the deadline. Like Stree, it satirises the standard instruction given to women, to get home before dark.\n\nThe villagers are quite blas\u00e9 about this. Women dress in their finery and gather to sing when an unfortunate man is so affected.\n\nIndu (Sonakshi Sinha) is in love with a halwai named Sunny (Saqib Saleem) from Ratodi but her eccentric father (Rajendra Gupta with a silly hairstyle) does not approve of any suitor who does not speak English.\n\nSo Indu and Sunny elope to get married.\n\nHe is delayed on his way home, and invites the curse.\n\nA sensible Indu tries what no other villager did -- take Sunny to a city doctor -- but it doesn't help.\n\nThere, she runs into Victor (Riteish Deshmukh) who calls himself a 'ghost hunter'.\n\nVictor has a funky hairstyle, dresses like he were going on a jungle safari and gets offended if anyone calls him a tantrik.\n\nHe enjoys interacting with ghosts and ghouls and helping the living get rid of them.\n\nWhile Sunny sulks and waits for inevitable death, Indu and Victor go about figuring out who Kakuda was, and why he targets the men of the village. These sequences are portrayed with rather elementary animation.\n\nIt's always more effective to have many more frightened faces on screen when a malevolent spirit is on the loose, so there's Sunny's friend Kilvish (Aasif Khan), the kind of character who exists in films to be on call by the main lead at all times, and Indu's spooky twin, who is around just to be possessed by Kakuda, and speak in a growl-y voice.\n\nAll films of this genre demand suspension of disbelief but the really effective ones come up with a credible, or at least interesting backstory for the ghost.\n\nKakuda is just weird and the attempt to make the curse comic does not hide its awfulness.\n\nRiteish Deshmukh plays Victor with such relish that without him, the film would have deflated quickly.\n\nThe other actors look dutifully scared or aghast as required by the scene.\n\nSaqib Salim is stuck looking forlorn while others play ghostbusters.\n\nKakuda has a paint-by-numbers, catch-the-trend-before-it-fades feel to it.\n\nSince it is made for OTT, the film might find its audience of horror fans but it is not particularly scary, and not the least bit funny.\n\nKakuda streams on ZEE5.\n\nKakuda Review Rediff

The recently released teaser trailer offers a glimpse into the intriguing plot of Sonakshi Sinha's upcoming project.\n\nFor those wondering, Sonakshi Sinha's Kakuda is gearing up to release on July 12, 2024, exclusively on ZEE5. As shown in the trailer, the story centers around Sunny, played by Saqib Saleem, who falls in love with Indira, portrayed by Sonakshi Sinha.\n\nTheir marriage leads them to the quaint village of Ratodi, where their happiness is short-lived. As part of a peculiar tradition, Sunny is supposed to open a smaller door on their wedding night at precisely 7:15 pm. If not followed, it would inadvertently invite the wrath of Kakuda, a malevolent ghost.\n\nIn the trailer of Sonakshi Sinha's upcoming movie, Sunny fails to open the door, resulting in Kakuda's arrival. The ghost curses the man of the house with a growing hump on his back, culminating in his death on the thirteenth day. As the curse progresses, Indira teams up with Victor, a quirky ghost hunter played by Riteish Deshmukh. The duo partake in a frantic race against time to save her husband.\n\nDirector Aditya Sarpotdar shared his enthusiasm in a recent report. He said, \"The release of the Kakuda trailer is just a glimpse into the fascinating narrative of a unique folklore that we've created. This labor of love has been a thrilling ride. Blending horror and comedy in a way that will keep audiences intrigued.\"\n\nSonakshi Sinha also expressed her excitement about the unique challenge of her upcoming movie.

Made in 2022, Kakuda owes its emergence on ZEE5 on July 11 to Munjya's dream run.\n\nSince its release on June 7, Munjya has notched up an estimated Rs 100 crore. Written by Yogesh Chandekar, the Maddock Films production is based on Konkani folklore about a preteen boy who, after being denied marriage with the woman he loves, dies and becomes a demon.\n\nThe cast includes Abhay Verma, Sharvari and Marathi acting veteran Suhas Joshi. The villain, who who commands a young man into doing his bidding, is a computer-generated creature.\n\nKakuda is broadly in the same folkloric horror-comedy zone as Munjya. Riteish Deshmukh, Sonakshi Sinha and Saqib Saleem star in a movie about a monster who targets young men in a village in Rajasthan. Kakuda channels the spirit of Maddock Films' humour-heavy Stree (2018), just as Munjya itself references Stree as well as the Marathi classic Zapatlela (1993).\n\nModestly budgeted and marketed, Munjya has worked where other Hindi productions have failed. Apart from boosting Sarpotdar's professional standing, Munjya suggests that Marathi filmmakers can bring to Hindi cinema the practices that have worked for them in their own language industry.\n\nRooted storytelling, an emphasis on strong screenplays rather than bankable stars, no-fuss filmmaking - these factors present in the average Marathi entertainer are there in Munjya too. After the film's success, Sarpotdar was felicitated by a group of Marathi directors, some of whom have worked in Hindi. Ravi Jadhav, Om Raut, Sameer Vidwans, Nipun Dharmadhikari, Laxman Utekar, Rajesh Mapuskar, Avinash Arun, Tejas Deoskar, Jayprad Desai, Nikhil Mahajan and Dnyanesh Zoting were among those who put on a display of unity for their peer that is rarely seen in Bollywood.\n\nWe knew we were making an interesting film, but we were also aware that the film had hardly any big stars and a limited two-week marketing campaign. We felt that if the opening weekend threw up decent numbers, the film would pick up from Monday. But the Friday numbers itself shocked us - it was three times more than what we were expecting.\n\nWhen we did theatre visits, we noticed that the first audiences were families and kids. I wanted this, since I have made the film for kids.\n\nHorror-comedies are aimed at a mature audience. But Munjya is a 10-year-old kid who becomes a monster. If a film like this had come along when I was at that age, I would have gone to watch it too.\n\nYogesh Chandekar and you have spoken of the Konkani folklore that inspired Munjya. What was the journey from script to screen like?\n\nI have always wanted to make a film on this subject. When I saw Kantara and Tumbbad, I wondered about the folklore from Maharashtra that hadn't yet been explored.\n\nMaddock Films approached me after Zombivli. A lot of credit goes to Yogesh to do things on paper and then envision them as a film. We aligned on everything we wanted to do with the script.\n\nYogesh wanted Munjya to be played by an actor with prosthetics. I had attempted that already in Kakuda, so I didn't want to go the same route. I knew the challenges in using prosthetics. In Kakuda, the monster is played by Mahesh Jadhav, who is four feet tall. He went through a three-hour-long process of prosthetics every day.\n\nI wanted to shoot Munjya in the summer at live locations in the Konkan. Prosthetics in the summer is a pain. So we took the call of going completely computer-generated. The feedback was that kids were intrigued by a CG character. That probably sold the idea that Munjya was a kid-friendly film, rather than a film about a grotesque-looking creature with prosthetics.\n\nMunjya has a fresh cast, including Abhay Verma in the lead role. On the other, Marathi audiences will be deeply familiar with Suhas Joshi, who memorably plays the grandmother.\n\nWhen I cast Suhas Joshi, she told me that the last film of hers that did some business in Hindi was Tezaab, which came out in 1988. I told her that I knew what an amazing actress she was, and that we were going to break the jinx.\n\nShe came in at the very last minute. We were supposed to work with a different actress who had to opt out because of health issues. Five days before the shoot started, I called Suhas Joshi and said, save me. She is brilliant.\n\nAbhay Verma had a supporting role in Ae Watan Mere Watan, which went to Prime Video. Munjya is his first theatrical release. We don't know who this boy is, and that is exactly why we cast him. Even for Sharvari, this is her first solo film.\n\n[Producer] Dinesh Vijan was very clear that the film's hero is Munjya. He wanted everyone around to support Munjya. We spent a lot on visual effects and the technical aspects.\n\nHad Kakuda come before Munjya, viewers would already have been familiar with your brand of horror-comedy, which you had previously explored in Zombivli. What is the difference between Kakuda and Munjya?\n\nKaukda was initially slotted for the end of the year. But perhaps of Munjya's success, the film is being released now since people seem keen on horror-comedy.\n\nKakuda was commissioned in pandemic times, when films were being made for OTT [streaming platforms]. We shot the film in 2022. Kakuda was ready with [producer] RSVP, who was planning to sell a bunch of their films in a bundle to ZEE5, which is probably why it took a while.\n\nKakuda was never meant to be on the big screen, but it's a fun watch on a smaller screen. It's more about laughs than scares. My approach to Kakuda would have been different if it would have been a theatrical release.\n\nWhen audiences watch a film on their home TVs, iPads or phones, the level of patience or attention span is limited. How you land scares or jokes, the way you shoot or edit, is different.\n\nHorror films can't really be enjoyed on a small screen - you're probably watching them in broad daylight or on a train. So you need to build on the drama and the humour. For Munjya, Dinesh Vijan was confident that it was going to be a theatrical release. So we built jump scares and approached the film knowing that it would be on a big screen.\n\nMunjya has a distinctly Marathi flavour. What are the learnings from Marathi cinema for the Hindi film industry?\n\nA lot of Marathi filmmakers are making strides in Hindi cinema because they know how to make films on small budgets and a little more efficiently. This is how we have survived all these years. The intention always is to shoot on location, shoot fast and quickly, and deliver a high-concept film that is commercial.\n\nThe DNA of Munjya is very Marathi because of the folklore from which it comes. How the character is pitched and created, the language he uses, the flavour of comedy - it is very local. Maharashtrian actors played Maharashtrian characters, and they brought a lot to the film in terms of its flavour and identity.\n\nCan success in Hindi cinema help Marathi directors? And is there a danger they will leave Marathi cinema behind?\n\nPeople have told me that they revisited my Marathi films after watching Munjya - that is the biggest win for me.\n\nI will definitely keep making films in both languages. I was recently on a call with Riteish Deshmukh to revamp the Faster Fene sequel. I would love to direct or even produce Marathi films. The approach for Marathi films is personal, indie, hands-on and instinctive.\n\nYour peers in the Marathi film industry celebrated Munjya's success. Who organised the party?\n\nTwo people were instrumental in the celebration. One was Om Raut [director of Tanhaji and Adipurush]. Om said, it's been a long time since a Marathi filmmaker is celebrating a success with a film with a barely known cast. The other was Ravi Jadhav. Ravi and Om made a few phone calls at a couple of days' notice and all these filmmakers turned up, which was a very sweet gesture.\n\nAnother idea behind the celebration was to show that as a community, Marathi filmmakers are very tight and very connected. In the last three-four years, a lot of Marathi filmmakers have been making Hindi content. We counted 16 filmmakers working in Hindi, and that number will only grow. Mainstream Hindi cinema is going to have a lot of Marathi filmmakers and Maharashtrian references.\n\nYou have deep roots in Marathi cinema. What does it mean to be a fourth-generation filmmaker?\n\nMy family has only ever been involved with films. At one point in college, I was contemplating doing something else and my family was shocked.\n\nMy great-grandfather, Narayanrao Sarpotdar, started the Aryan Film Company during the silent cinema period. He acted in, directed and produced many silent films. Unfortunately, the negatives were destroyed in a fire at the National Film Archive of India many years ago. I don't have copies of his films, but I do have details of the stories and the cast. For instance, Lalita Pawar made her debut in one of my great-grandfather's films.\n\nMy grandfather was a producer and distributor. My dad was into commercials and distribution. We owned the Alka Talkies theatre in Pune for nearly 25 years. My childhood was spent in that theatre.\n\nAt the age of 19, I moved to Hyderabad to work at Ramoji Film City. My father knew Ramoji Rao, who told me that I had a free pass to join any department and learnt whatever I wanted. So from being a camera attendant to knowing how a studio worked, I got first-hand, very practical experience.\n\nI made my first Marathi film [Ulaadhal] at the age of 23. Hindi was a whole new ballgame. It meant starting as a newcomer.\n\nI could have easily made Munjya in Marathi too. But in Marathi, I was restricted to Maharashtra and Marathi-speaking audiences. In the Hindi film industry, the basic canvas itself is massive.\n\nAlso read:", "source": {"uri": "scroll.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scroll.in"}, "authors": [{"uri":

We have seen movies like Stree, Roohi and Munjya masterfully intertwine superstitions and societal issues, setting the bar high for the genre. The latest entrant continues this trend, proving that even with a simple premise, a film can be both engaging and entertaining.\n\nMuch like his Munjya, Aditya Sarpotdar's Kakuda takes the familiar elements of horror and comedy, blending them with a sharp critique of societal norms. The result is a film that not only entertains but also makes you think. Its clever use of superstitions and horror tropes keeps you on edge, while the comedic moments provide much-needed relief.\n\nKakuda takes us deep into the heart of a remote village, Ratodi, where folklore and superstition reign supreme. The film centers around an eerie legend: every Tuesday at 7.15 PM, a supernatural entity known as Kakuda knocks on the door of every house with two doors -- one big and one small. To evade this sinister force, villagers must keep the small door open before the designated time. Failure to do so results in a terrifying curse that targets the male member of the household, causing the growth of a giant tumour on their back, causing the back to hunch and leading to their death within 13 days. Indira (Sonakshi Sinha) appoints Victor (Riteish Deshmukh) - a ghost hunter - as she seeks to save her husband Sunny (Saqib Saleem), from the deadly curse. Along with their friend Kilvish (Aasif Khan), they set out to get to the bottom of the curse.\n\nNot much time spent on establishing the folklore or dismantling it. The simplicity of the premise works both in favour of the film and against it. The horror elements are few and far between, but the ones that are present are not good enough to cause jump-scares. Some of the jokes land, while others don't. Ritesh Deshmukh, as the ghost hunter brought in to tackle the curse, gets to mouth most of the jokes and delivers them well. It's a terrific casting choice - for Riteish is fantastic in his role, oscillating between his amazing comic timing and the serious moments. It's a good reminder of the range Riteish has as an actor. Saqib has little to do but convincingly portrays the anguish of a man marked by a deadly curse and his efforts to ensure his widow finds happiness after his death are touching. Sonakshi Sinha is convincing in a role where she not only confronts superstitions but also brings a surprising twist to the story (watch the film to know more on that front).\n\nThe story also mixes horror with societal superstitions. Case in point: it portrays a widow, seen as unlucky and forbidden from socialising. It intertwines these themes to deliver frights and critique customs that were prevalent in communities back in the day or perhaps, to this day, while at it.\n\nHowever, when the story behind Kakuda is revealed, it leaves a simplistic aftertaste; it isn't complex or layered, which might disappoint those looking for a deeper narrative. The film also falters in its world-building. The story of Kakuda is not intricately woven into the fabric of the village's daily life, making the supernatural elements feel way less palpable or real. The ending also seems rushed.\n\nDespite the flaws, the film is an enjoyable film that effectively uses folklore to create a sense of pervasive dread. The performances are strong and the premise sets it apart from typical horror fare. It's an interesting exploration of superstition, fear and the lengths people will go to protect their loved ones. A good, one-time watch!", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superstition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakuda,_Miyagi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kakuda, Miyagi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kakuda, Miyagi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riteish_Deshmukh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Riteish Deshmukh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindi cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_horror", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy horror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Folklore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saqib_Saleem", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saqib Saleem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonakshi_Sinha", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sonakshi Sinha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supernatural"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/07/fotojet-2024-07-10t215039.926-2024-07-e2d5a1fb5e9af72b5bd1bfafd6c8ccab-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717042", "eventUri": "eng-9717042", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kakuda, Miyagi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

The movie opens with an elderly man getting off near his village -- one that the bus conductor didn't even know was there - and cycle home like his life depends on it. For the people of Ratauri, getting home on time (7.15 PM on Tuesdays to be exact) is actually a matter of life or death.\n\nIf you aren't home by the designated time to open a smaller door next to your house's main door, the 'kakuda' would attack you. This attack leaves you with a bump on your back and the clock for your demise starts ticking.\n\nSo far, Kakuda is Stree meets The Ring which eventually even wades into In the Tall Grass territory - the novelty usually present in the Maddock Films horror universe is absent. So, what works for the film is the cast and their comic timing.\n\nKakuda stars Sonakshi Sinha as Indira, a woman who is fed up of her father bringing home a string of matches for her which results in her deciding to elope with her boyfriend Sunny (Saqib Saleem). To the film's credit, this simple setup is given enough detailing to not feel tiresome.

The non-partisan group Political Polls shared a new general election poll Friday afternoon with a curious finding: Biden led Trump 45 percent to 44 percent post-debate. The previous poll \"was a tie,\" the group noted on social media.

And perhaps most appropriate for the moment, chimed in @Drugged_Atlas, who channeled the philosopher Socrates: \"All I know is that I don\u2019t know nothing.\" shrug emoji no one knows anything.... https://t.co/kojIZhxdF7\u2014 Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) June 28, 2024", "summary": "<img src=\"https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/donald-trump-and-president-joe-biden.jpg?id=52507556&width=2000&height=1500&coordinates=0%2C1%2C0%2C1\"/><br/><br/><p>\n\tA new poll showing the <a href=\"https://www.rawstory.com/trump-biden-debate-2668627606/\" target=\"_blank\">disastrous</a> Atlanta debate appears to have helped \u2014 or at least, not harmed \u2014 President Joe Biden's chances, and the internet laughed as everyone rallied around the notion it seems no one knows anything anymore.\n</p><p>\n\tAmidst a sea of articles and opinion pieces questioning Biden's decision to seek re-election \u2014 and even a certain <a href=\"https://www.rawstory.com/biden-new-york-times-editorial-board/\" target=\"_blank\">prominent paper of record urging him to drop out</a> \u2014 emerged a small beacon of hope for Democrats.\n</p><p>\n\tThe non-partisan group Political Polls shared a new general election poll Friday afternoon with a curious finding: Biden led Trump 45 percent to 44 percent post-debate.

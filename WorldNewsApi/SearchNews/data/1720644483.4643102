{"id": 231244954, "title": "Cuthand: Buffalo returning to Prairies revives First Nations traditions", "text": "Small pockets of buffalo remained. In Canada, there were two herds, one in Wainwright, Alberta and another in Elk Island National Park, also in Alberta. These two locations have served as the incubator for the return of the buffalo on a smaller scale. A few years ago, a group of First Nations got together and signed a treaty to bring back the buffalo and prepare land for them to once again thrive. I was fortunate to be allowed to attend a conference call that included Indigenous buffalo people from the Northwest Territories in Canada to as far south as northern Mexico. The range of these beautiful animals is immense. Various representatives reported on the progress of their herd and tips and information were shared. Many of the buffalo ranchers are cattle ranchers, so they made the mistake of treating them as if they were the same. For example, one rancher reported that he separated the bulls from the herd like he would with cattle. He found the bulls were frustrated and not happy. As it turned out, they belonged to the herd, and they had a job to do. In the wild, the buffalo bulls are the protectors and keep the cows and calves safe. They were kept in a separate pen and felt frustrated. A buffalo herd, as it turns out, is a unit that has developed its internal culture to survive, and the buffalo felt it.", "summary": "The return of the buffalo is both spiritual and economic.

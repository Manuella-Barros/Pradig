The New Zealand international has two years left on his contract and Leeds are likely to look to extend his deal amid rising interest in his signature.\n\nSpeaking after United's draw with Fulham, in which Wood missed another one-on-one chance, head coach Thomas Christiansen said: \"I don't know about the bids.

The Brazil international stunned world football by leaving Barcelona for the French capital after his release clause was activated by PSG.\n\nWood has been heavily linked with a move away from Elland Road since last season's failure to gain promotion back to the Premier League. Since a proposed move to Turkey fell through last month, Burnley have emerged as the leading contenders to sign the New Zealand international who scored 27 Championship goals last term.\n\nSean Dyche is desperate to replace Andre Gray, who joined Watford last week, but has seen an initial offer for Wood of \u00a312m rebuffed by Leeds. The Daily Mail understand the Clarets will return with a new \u00a320m offer this week but Christiansen remains adamant he is unwilling to consider any deal bar one which breaks the world transfer record again.\n\n\"If they (rival clubs) give me \u00a3200m like for Neymar, perhaps we can talk about that,\" he said, according to the Yorkshire Evening Post. \"I believe that in the programme he said he feels happy and that after I signed he said he would be happy staying here. Why shouldn't he?\"\n\nThe Whites agonisingly missed out on a play-off place last season, finishing seventh as Garry Monk left the club for promotion favourites Middlesbrough. Wood, who opened his account for the new campaign in the win over Bolton Wanderers, was key to Leeds coming so close to the top six and Christiansen warns the club face missing out on promotion again if he is allowed to depart.\n\n\"It's very important,\" the Leeds boss added. \"There's no doubt that he's (not) going to leave. \"They (other clubs) can come in with many bids - of course he's a good striker - but I want him to stay and if we want to achieve something this season, you cannot sell your best players.\n\n\"I haven't talked to the club about it but I imagine that they are as ambitious as I am.

I believe more in the player than in the money and I believe that he can help the team to achieve our goals.\n\n\"Finally, what will happen, we will see but the club have made a good effort and offer to keep him.\n\n\"I've been speaking to him about the situation and telling him to be focused on what he has to do - be 100 per cent in the game against Sunderland, forget about all the rumours and try to do his best on the pitch. It will all be for his benefit.\"\n\nLeeds have been looking at additional strikers throughout the transfer window, signing Caleb Ekuban from Chievo but missing out on Ashley Fletcher who left West Ham United for Middlesbrough in a \u00a36m deal.\n\nLeeds have expressed a firm interest in Hamburg's Pierre-Michel Lasogga, who is fifth choice and surplus to requirements at the Bundesliga side, but his \u00a350,000-a-week wage is as a major obstacle to a move to Elland Road.\n\nUnited's hierarchy remain adamant that Wood will not be sold and the failure of Burnley's second bid saw the Premier League side, who pulled in \u00a318m from their recent sale of Andre Gray to Watford, turn their attention to Deportivo La Coruna's Romanian forward Florin Andone instead.\n\nChristiansen, however, insisted that Leeds would be prepared if a club weighed in with a late offer which the club felt compelled to accept.\n\n\"First we have to know when he goes or if he goes,\" Christiansen said. \"If he does we will have someone else in mind.\"", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation"},

By Tom Mordey\n\nLast Updated: 17/08/17 3:31pm\n\nThirty goals in all competitions. And now a big-money Premier League transfer target. Leeds striker Chris Wood is hot property right now.\n\nBurnley have had a \u00a312m offer turned down, with Sky sources saying Leeds have also rejected a \u00a316m bid from another Premier League side.\n\nSo how much would it take to sign Wood? Could he break Darren Bent's record Championship sale from Charlton to Tottenham for \u00a316.5million? And is he worth the money? We take a look.\n\nHis Elland Road story so far\n\nLet's start with the back story. Wood signed for Leeds in the summer of 2015, switching from Leicester for a fee of around \u00a33.5million. That fee looks like small change now, but it didn't go quite to plan originally.\n\nWood struggled to hit the ground running, missing a penalty in an EFL Cup shootout defeat to Doncaster Rovers in just his second game. He went on to finish the season as Leeds' top scorer with 13 goals in 36 league games, but plenty of fans felt underwhelmed by his impact.\n\nThe second season was a different story. Wood overcame niggling injury problems and backed himself to hit the 20-mark under Garry Monk in 2016/17.\n\nHe did more than that. Leeds and Wood endured a stuttering start, but midway through August the striker celebrated a late equaliser against Fulham by cupping his ear to the Elland Road Kop. It was the best way to answer his critics. And he never looked back.\n\nCrucial goal followed crucial goal as he embarked on a memorable season. There was the late strike at Newcastle, the towering header at home to Brighton, and a sumptuous lob in a 3-1 win over Birmingham. Wood fired Leeds towards an unlikely promotion push, with Monk's side only narrowly missing out on a play-off spot.\n\nWood finished the season as the Championship's top scorer with 27 goals, and his outstanding campaign was recognised with a place in the PFA Championship Team of the Year.\n\nWhat do they say about him?\n\nMonk described Wood as a \"natural goalscorer\" last season and his successor Thomas Christiansen already regards him as a \"very important player\" for the team.\n\nBut Leeds is one of 11 clubs Wood has represented and there has been plenty more praise along the way. Scott Malone, his former team-mate at Millwall, recently told Sky Sports about his memories of playing with the New Zealander.\n\n\"I remember his power and the size of him,\" said Malone, who now plays for Fulham. \"On the training pitch, in a five-a-side game, you couldn't get near him. He was frightening.\n\nHe's definitely athletic enough to step up to the Premier League. His speed, his power, his heading, his presence is there.\n\nScott Malone on Chris Wood\n\n\"He'd get it off the keeper, touch it round the corner, goal. He was definitely one of the best players we had there at that time. He scored 11 in 19 appearances. I remember going to Brighton and he scored two, including one from about 35 yards, and I thought: 'Wow, this kid is going to go places.'\n\n\"He always had it in him. I read something Garry Monk said last season, that he needed to be more aggressive. That was the one thing I'd say of him when he was at Millwall. He wasn't too aggressive, he was quite a nice guy. But now he has found a bit of a nasty streak and it's paying off.\n\n\"He's definitely athletic enough to step up to the Premier League,\" added Malone. \"His speed, his power, his heading, his presence is there. He could handle it in the Premier League, but you can't give an answer until people move up to that level. I hope he does.\"\n\nS'land vs Leeds\n\nAugust 19, 2017, 5:15pm\n\nLive on\n\nGet Sky Sports Get a Sky Sports pass\n\nNew Zealand manager Anthony Hudson, meanwhile, cites his mentality as one of his biggest strengths. \"Woodsy is a top professional and great to have in the team,\" he told Sky Sports. \"He's incredibly single minded and focused on what he wants.\n\n\"I'm not surprised one bit at how well he's doing right now, it's certainly not by accident. And he absolutely loves playing for his country. He'll be back in the Premier League soon.\"\n\nThe stats\n\nAny striker scoring goals at Wood's rate in the Championship is going to attract Premier League interest, but what fee should he command? Let's assess his stats against some of his divisional rivals.\n\nFrom Britt Assombalonga to Benik Afobe, we've picked out every striker sold by a Championship club for over \u00a310m since Wood arrived at Leeds.\n\nChampionship strikers sold for over \u00a310m since 2015/16 Player From To Fee Britt Assombalonga Nottinham Forest Middlesbrough \u00a315m Jonathan Kodjia Bristol City Aston Villa \u00a315m Ross McCormack Fulham Aston Villa \u00a312m Scott Hogan Brentford Aston Villa \u00a312m Benik Afobe Wolves Bournemouth \u00a310m\n\nIt's a distinguished list of strikers at Championship level, but Wood has the best scoring record of them all over the last two seasons. And while his shooting accuracy is the lowest of the six at 46.1 per cent, his big chance conversion rate of 54.7 per cent puts him behind only the \u00a315m Assombalonga.\n\nScoring records since 2015/16 Player Games Goals Shot accuracy Shot conversion Big chance conversion Chris Wood 82 41 46.4% 18.9% 53.9% Scott Hogan 47 22 63.7% 21.6% 40.9% JonathN Kodjia 85 38 51.2% 15.0% 46.8% Britt Assombalonga 38 15 58.2% 24.6% 62.5% Ross McCormack 72 25 54.2% 14.2% 44.4% Benik Afobe 72 19 53.0% 17.0% 46.7%\n\nThat's a crucial factor for any striker. Are they hitting the back of the net when the best opportunities present themselves? Wood will be eager to put his one-on-one misses against Preston and Fulham behind him, but the stats point to fine finishing ability.\n\nWood also has age on his side. A key area for any potential buyer is whether or not a striker has room to improve. Wood is only 25, so his suitors can be confident there's plenty more to come from him.\n\nChris Wood's improvement at Leeds Season Games Goals Shot accuracy Shot conversion Big chance conversion % of team goals 2015/16 36 13 38.8% 12.4% 37.9% 26% 2016/17 44 27 53.7% 25.7% 71.9% 44%\n\nWood's progress so far augurs well for the future. His big chance conversion jumped from 37.9 per cent to 71.9 per cent last season, which helps explain why Monk's side won so many games despite having the fewest shots on target in the league.\n\nWhat next?\n\nIt's easy to see why Leeds are so keen to keep Wood. They have already rejected an offer of \u00a316m, but will they be able to resist if the money goes past \u00a320m?\n\nThe 25-year-old is rated at 6/4 by Sky Bet to join Burnley before the end of the transfer window, and his odds to stay at Leeds are 4/7. A move to Huddersfield is a 14/1 shot, and he is 18/1 to end up at West Brom or Stoke.\n\nWhatever happens next, it's clear why Wood is in-demand. It's surely only a matter of time until he makes the step up to the Premier League.\n\nAlso See: Championship video Fixtures Table Live on Sky Get Sky Sports", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Materials_and_Supplies", "wgt": 100, "id": 169, "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Materials and Supplies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 100, "id": 220, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Supplies", "wgt": 100, "id": 663, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Supplies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 100, "id": 851, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Woodcraft"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 100, "id": 1177, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "type": "loc", "id": "171"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "type": "loc", "id": "86962"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "type": "loc", "id": "91275"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "type": "loc", "id": "91699"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305673", "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_United_A.F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306184", "label": {"eng": "Leeds United A.F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306186", "label": {"eng": "Football League Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Monk", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "306187", "label": {"eng": "Garry Monk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306193", "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brentford_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306198", "label": {"eng": "Brentford F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millwall_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306199", "label": {"eng": "Millwall F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlton_Athletic_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306201", "label": {"eng": "Charlton Athletic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306207", "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306277", "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_kick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307311", "label": {"eng": "Penalty kick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnley_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "311434", "label": {"eng": "Burnley F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "313349", "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlesbrough_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "313857", "label": {"eng": "Middlesbrough F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Bent", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "317437", "label": {"eng": "Darren Bent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_McCormack", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "317439", "label": {"eng": "Ross McCormack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "322214", "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.F.C._Bournemouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "324064", "label": {"eng": "A.F.C.

In a window where Britt Assombalonga costs \u00a315m and Andre Gray \u00a33m more, the club don't need to waver about a fee for Wood.\n\nThe numbers get stupid or the interest in him goes nowhere and Leeds would prefer to see the second scenario play out.\n\nWood, Assombalonga and Gray are not like-for-like centre-forwards or replicas of each other, but clubs who court players like them want the same thing. Wood's goal-scoring last season was a flashing light for managers at the bottom end of the Premier League scale and the chances of a transfer window without an offer for him were as slim as United's enthusiasm for fielding formal bids.\n\nThere are two ways in which the club's hand can be forced: via an offer which clears the striker's value comfortably or by Wood pulling rank and agitating to leave, in the manner of Coutinho or van Dijk. Neither occurrence is apparent yet and, even in those circumstances, it is late in the window for Leeds to be trading a player whose presence is fundamental to the structure of their team.\n\nThere were signs in pre-season, and at Bolton Wanderers 10 days ago, of Leeds attacking with more pace and more immediacy than they did while Garry Monk was head coach, but Thomas Christiansen has not gone wildly off piste. His formation is as it was under Monk and Wood is still United's focal point. It was Wood who Leeds were looking for from either flank as Preston dug in with 10 men on Saturday. It was Wood who the decisive chances fell to against Preston and Fulham, as they invariably did last season.\n\nThe club's recruitment has changed the tone, the flair and the national identity of their squad but it has not altered the pecking order in a position where Wood stands alone as a proven Championship finisher.\n\nThat Leeds have not sought to pre-empt his departure could be taken as a sign that the club are genuine in their insistence that Wood will stay.\n\nAmongst 10 first-team signings, Caleb Ekuban is the only new forward and is not, by his own admission, Wood's body double. The Ghanaian said on his arrival that his strength was as a \"second striker\"; the quick and mobile half of a front two. England is a new environment for him and a very obvious step up from Albanian football. A four-year contract suggests that Leeds intend to give him time to adjust.\n\nThere were nice touches and a sharp finish in Ekuban's debut against Port Vale but Wood's role is a specialism in the Championship. Ekuban, as a substitute, offers a change of tack but Christiansen looked instead to Samuel Saiz as Saturday's meeting with Preston ground towards stalemate. Kemar Roofe and Stuart Dallas came off the bench as Leeds chased a win against Fulham on Tuesday.\n\nWood is central to the framework and selling him now leaves a fortnight at most to source a like-for-like replacement within certain limits.\n\nEvidence of how risky that trade-off can be is there in the final days of the January window in 2013. Sold Luciano Becchio, acquired Steve Morison, and from that deal nobody did especially well.\n\nFour-and-a-half years on, Assombalonga's salary at Middlesbrough would have broken the wage structure at Elland Road. Likewise Andre Gray's. There is more to consider than the outlay of a fee itself. Down the road at Sheffield Wednesday they can toy with the idea of selling Fernando Forestieri because Sheffield Wednesday have strikers climbing over each other to play.\n\nFar from cashing in on Wood, Leeds have not yet provided sufficient support for him. There are moves afoot and another forward should arrive before the window closes, though suggestions of interest in Ross McCormack appear to hold little water and the club's approach for Hamburg's Pierre-Michel Lasogga is at the mercy of Lasogga's high wage.\n\nThe German is fifth choice and Hamburg want to move him on at the earliest opportunity but it will take some charity on Hamburg's part to make Lasogga affordable.\n\nLeeds, still, are as adamant as a Championship club can be that Wood will be at Elland Road beyond the end of this window.\n\nThat resistance should be heightened by the fact that they are not supremely prepared for his departure or guaranteed to be able to compensate for it.\n\n\"You cannot sell your best players,\" said Christiansen on Saturday, knowing full well that in this climate so many clubs are doing exactly that.\n\nBut in the case of Wood, and at this juncture, he is right.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri":

Burnley have had two bids for the New Zealand international rejected by the Whites following much speculation that last season's top scorer is on the verge of leaving west Yorkshire.\n\nWood has started each of the club's three Championship matches this term, scoring in the opening weekend win over Bolton Wanderers, yet he continues to be subject of rumours regarding his future. The Yorkshire Evening Post understand a follow-up bid from Premier League Burnley, which initial reports suggest was around \u00a320m, has been turned down. A move to Turkey has previously fallen through.\n\nSpeaking after the 0-0 draw with Fulham on Tuesday [15 August], Leeds manager Thomas Christiansen said: \"I don't know about the bids. I'm not listening to them. I'm just focused on Chris on the pitch. When he plays, he tries to do his best.\n\n\"If it's right that we have these offers, because I don't want to listen, then the president (Andrea Radrizzani) and Victor (sporting director Victor Orta) can talk about it. Of course it can influence (Wood's thinking) a little bit, like all players when they speak about you. If they speak about the Premier League then that's much more pressure but I believe he'll score again soon.\"\n\nChristiansen has previously stated he has no plans to allow Wood to leave, and that only a bid exceeding the \u00a3198m Paris Saint-Germain paid Barcelona to sign Neymar would tempt into parting with a player who netted 27 times last term.\n\nYet despite the stance adopted by Christiansen and Leeds, the club have seemingly started preparing for life after Wood. According to the Yorkshire Post, among the contenders to fill the void left by the Kiwi is McCormack or Hamburg forward Pierre-Michel Lasogga - but it will be links with the former that will create waves around the Championship outfit.\n\nThe Scotland international enjoyed a fruitful spell with Leeds, scoring 58 goals in 157 appearances between 2010 and 2014 but his departure to Fulham left a sour taste with many supporters. McCormack continued his sparkling form with 42 goals in 100 outings for the west London club, winning a move to relegated Aston Villa where he was charged with leading the club back to the top flight.\n\nBut the 30-year-old's career has suffered a steep decline since moving to Villa Park and after netting just three times in 22 outings a failure to attending several training sessions and subsequent fall-out with new manager Steve Bruce led to him joining Nottingham Forest on loan, where again he failed to make an impression.\n\nThough McCormack has been re-integrated this season his future at Villa appears increasingly bleak with Bruce having yet to turn to the forward despite complaining over his lack of attacking resources. The Villa Park club have meanwhile taken just one point from their opening three league games despite being heavily tipped to challenge for promotion.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri":

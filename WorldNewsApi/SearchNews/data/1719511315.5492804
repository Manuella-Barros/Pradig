DRAMA Fallout COMEDY Gen V LIMITED/ANTHOLOGY Expats Apple TV+ With two-time comedy series winner Ted Lasso out of the picture, its best bets are a trio of expensive, glossy and female-star-driven vehicles (Aniston and Witherspoon! Wiig! Larson!) \u2014 as well as somewhat critically divisive projects like The New Look. DRAMA The Morning Show COMEDY Palm Royale LIMITED/ANTHOLOGY Lessons in Chemistry Disney+ The streamer has landed three drama series and two limited series noms, all for shows inspired by Star Wars or Marvel properties. But it has yet to snag a series win, and given its current slate of contenders, that\u2019s unlikely to change this year. DRAMA Loki COMEDY Renegade Nell LIMITED/ANTHOLOGY Echo HBO/Max The perennial powerhouse no longer has such series behemoths as Veep, Game of Thrones and Succession but remains a formidable contender in every category \u2014 not least limited series, which it has won in five of the past 10 years. DRAMA The Gilded Age COMEDY Hacks LIMITED/ANTHOLOGY True Detective: Night Country Hulu DRAMA No titles COMEDY Only Murders in the Building LIMITED/ANTHOLOGY We Were the Lucky Ones Netflix The face of streaming has won series awards three times: best drama for The Crown and best limited for The Queen\u2019s Gambit and Beef. This year, The Crown could repeat, while Ripley and Baby Reindeer are frontrunners for limited. DRAMA The Crown COMEDY The Gentlemen LIMITED/ANTHOLOGY Ripley Paramount+ The former CBS All Access has yet to land so much as a nom for a series award, and its team would be thrilled to overcome that hurdle this year, as could happen with the limited series Lawmen: Bass\u202fReeves. DRAMA Star Trek: Discovery COMEDY Frasier LIMITED/ANTHOLOGY Lawmen: Bass Reeves Peacock The young NBCUniversal service has been fighting for subscribers but managed to win its first Emmys (comedy guest actress and reality casting) last year. Realistically, it\u2019s not yet a viable contender for a series nom.

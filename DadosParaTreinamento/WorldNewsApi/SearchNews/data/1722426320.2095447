Instead, for the first time since 2019, general manager Lou Lamoriello arrived at the microphone with a pick to announce in the first round. The Islanders made Cole Eiserman their selection at 20th overall, elevating the Boston University commit who set a goal-scoring record at the U.S. National Team Development Program to instant status as the organization\u2019s top prospect, even as questions linger over the left-winger\u2019s boom-or-bust potential. \u201cI\u2019m definitely a shooter that loves to score goals,\u201d Eiserman said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna bring a positive attitude and definitely a competitive side. As time goes on, I\u2019m definitely gonna be able to be more physical and use my body a lot.\u201d The 17-year-old from Newburyport, Mass., was one of the most intriguing prospects in the lead-up to this draft. A year ago, some analysts projected him as one of the best five players in the draft, but a season in which Eiserman scored over a goal per game but struggled defensively and away from the puck saw his stock fall to where the Islanders could take a swing with him as late as 20th. \u201cWe had him rated pretty high. So we were excited that he was there when we picked,\u201d general manager Lou Lamoriello said. \u201cThat\u2019s all we can say. As far as when people fall, everybody has their own preference. But we were looking for a certain type of player and we were able to get it.\u201d Lamoriello also said the Islanders would not have traded out of the 20th pick, a departure not just from recent years but from the March trade deadline when he said their first-round pick was available. (The Islanders did trade the 18th pick along with their second-rounder, moving to 20th overall to get an extra second-round pick). It\u2019s not the first time the Isles have taken a low-floor, high-ceiling prospect from the NTDP whose calling card is scoring and Eiserman has drawn some comparisons to Oliver Wahlstrom, who likely reached the end of his rope with the organization this year. There are, however, a couple of key differences. First, Eiserman is one of the youngest players in this year\u2019s draft, leaving ample room for development. And second, while Wahlstrom was a known sniper, with 48 goals over 62 games in his last NTDP season, Eiserman\u2019s scoring is on another level entirely. He lit the lamp 58 times in 57 games with the NTDP this season, along with 31 assists, and holds the NTDP record for career goals with 127. In short, Eiserman is the sort of prospect who could far outplay the slot in which he was selected. That is, at least, the hope. \u201cI felt like they really understood me as a player,\u201d Eiserman said of the Islanders\u2019 brass. \u201cI always respect people like that because it takes a different mindset, I think, to understand how I think and how I play the game.\u201d What, exactly, is different about him? \u201cI definitely see the game differently than a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether you like it or not, it\u2019s something that I\u2019m going to bring and they like it. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m excited about.\u201d That did not seem to worry Lamoriello, who referred to Eiserman as \u201ca pure goal scorer\u201d and mentioned that he would be playing for BU coach Jay Pandolfo in the fall \u2014 who played for New Jersey when Lamoriello ran the organization \u2014 as a big reason for the organization\u2019s belief in Eiserman\u2019s development. Eiserman, who turns 18 in August, will be a freshman at BU this fall \u2014 he hopes alongside top pick Macklin Celebrini, whom he counts as a close friend. As to his longer-term aspirations, he said Friday was too early to make any declarations about when he hopes to make the jump to the NHL. \u201cObviously, just being reliable defensively and being able to play more than 15 minutes a night and being able to be in all situations,\u201d Eiserman said asked where he could improve. \u201cThe year at BU is going to be huge for me.\u201d As for his upside, there is no secret about that. \u201cI think [the Islanders] see my goal scoring and they see what I\u2019ve done with it and they love that,\u201d Eiserman said. And why wouldn\u2019t they?", "summary": "There was no deal waiting for the Islanders at the first round of this NHL draft.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/29/sports/islanders-pick-cole-eiserman-in-2024-nhl-draft/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-rco6q9cxd-1719637941429.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1719623589&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:13:37", "author": "Ethan Sears", "authors": ["Ethan Sears"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.072}

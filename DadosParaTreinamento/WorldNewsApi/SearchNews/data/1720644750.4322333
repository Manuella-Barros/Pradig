On Saturday, June 1, Nischal Tamang and sister Simran Tamang graduated from Everett High School in Everett, Massachusetts, where they were honored as valedictorian and salutatorian, respectively, WXII 12 reported. Per the outlet, the siblings grew up Nepal and lived with other family members while their parents relocated to the United States. \"When they first came here my mom was a cashier at a Dunkin' Donuts and my dad was a delivery man for a local restaurant,\" Simran recalled to WXII 12, as Nischal added, \"They worked countless hours and sacrificed their sleep just to make sure we are financially stable so we can get what we want. I\u2019m very thankful for them.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. After four years, the family reunited and the siblings' father put them in the same grade. According to Simran, their dad never encouraged the brother and sister duo to see each other as their competition amid their studies. \"Our dad emphasizes the fact that we should instead of being competitive against each other, we should be supportive because his successes are my successes,\" he told WXII 12. \"I feel like we were more helping each other out,\" added Nischal to the outlet. \"Our parents told us the title doesn\u2019t matter. If it comes to our family whoever, gets it gets it.\" During her commencement speech earlier this month, Nischal reflected on recent years, stating, \"High school is an important time in our lives because it's the time when we discover our identity \u2014 we figure out who we are and what we hope to be.\" Simran, for his part, looked forward to the future in his statements, noting, \"This is not only a graduation, but the beginning of a new adventure, a new chapter of our life with an uncertain but exciting future.\" Nischal and Simran will become the first members of their family to attend college when they begin their studies at Harvard in the fall. Nishal told WXII 12 she plans to study computer science and potentially become a computer programmer, while Simran explained, \"I\u2019m majoring in biomedical engineering, and hopefully I have the privilege of attending medical school and can become a doctor.\"", "summary": "Nischal and Simran Tamang graduated from Everett High School in Massachusetts earlier this month", "url": "https://people.com/siblings-graduate-as-valedictorian-salutatorian-going-to-harvard-8659541", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/8CyILWimFcMIXZ5Ov_1sbZAqy24=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(336x220:338x222)/Nischal-Simran-Tamang-060624-c23e1b1b483a4a179afd44578de571d6.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:00:00", "author": "Nicholas Rice", "authors": ["Nicholas Rice"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.123}

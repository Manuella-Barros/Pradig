{"id": 243258484, "title": "EDEN CONFIDENTIAL: Model Jasmine Lennard is 'heartbroken' by death of Crazy Town singer Shifty...", "text": "Already 'completely traumatised' and 'exhausted' by the illness of her mother, the former Bond girl Marilyn Galsworthy, who fell into a coma last month, Jasmine Lennard is now mourning her son's father. Seth Binzer, the frontman of American rap-rock group Crazy Town, was found dead in his Los Angeles home on Monday at the age 49. Known as Shifty Shellshock, the singer is understood to have died of an accidental drug overdose. Jasmine, 38, has a 13-year-old son, Phoenix, with Binzer. 'We are heartbroken,' she tells me. 'He was a troubled soul, but a beautiful one and he had a heart of gold. He struggled with addiction throughout his life. God knows, he tried so hard to beat his demons, but sadly he lost his battle.' Florence's next move? Hugging! Oppenheimer star Florence Pugh, has enjoyed explosive success in Hollywood, but the Oxford restaurateur's daughter is in need of a rest. 'I just finished my second Marvel movie, which was pretty huge,' she tells me at Glastonbury, where she introduced Dune: Part Two, at the on-site Pilton Palais Cinema. The actress, 28, who plays Princess Irulan Corrino in the hit film, adds: 'What's next? I think a tiny bit of a break from acting. I need to do some dancing, and I need to do some hugging with friends, and I just need to just enjoy.' The smart set's talking about... Baronet bidding 700-year family seat castle goodbye Although he hates filling in forms, baronet Sir Thomas Ingilby admits enjoying one question \u2014 where he's asked: 'How long at present address?' He invariably writes in the answer: '700 years.' Sadly, he won't be able to write that much longer, because he is to put his Ripley Castle Estate, near Harrogate in Yorkshire, on the market \u2014 bringing to an end more than seven centuries 'as a much-loved family home'. He says the sale, which will happen later this year, has 'the full support of their family'. The Grade I listed, 14th century house has magnificent grounds, lakes, deer park, walled gardens, hothouses and kitchen garden. It is a wedding venue and every year hosts Ripley Show. The sale is likely also to include the pub, hotel and restaurant, plus a few houses in the village. Sir Thomas, 68, who has five children with his wife Emma, will continue to live nearby and 'focus on their other interests'. Earlier this month, I disclosed that another baronet, Sir Philip Williams, had put his splendid Bridehead estate, in Dorset, on the market for \u00a330 million, after seven generations in his family. Could it be the prospect of a Labour government? She's spent her much of career advancing to the sound of gunfire but, at the age of 58, former war correspondent turned film-maker Charlotte Eagar would appear to have taken on her most daunting assignment to date. I can disclose that she's answered a last-minute call from Tory HQ to stand in Liverpool's Wavertree constituency \u2013 taking on Labour's Paula Barker, who, in 2019, had a 27,000 majority. 'In some ways, this is a challenging time being a Conservative, but it's an exciting time as well,' Eagar tells me. Glastonbury won't screen England's last-16 match against Slovakia tomorrow, and the music festival's founder, Sir Michael Eavis, has some strong views on the sport. 'I just don't see how they can carry on without altering the rules,' the dairy farmer declares. 'The offside rule really needs to be scrapped. 'Then there would be more goals \u2014 it'll be more fun, and then everyone's going to be happier.' (Very) Modern Manners It's in the building that was home to Le Caprice, but London restaurant Arlington's chic 1980s-style decor is not matched by the 'style' of some of the new diners. This week, various men turned up in shorts and T-shirts, leaving other patrons aghast. 'I know the weather's warm, but this is St James's, not Bermuda,' harrumphs one trencherman, who was a regular at Le Caprice, where Princess Diana often had lunch. 'I don't expect to see hairy legs as I'm eating my steak tartare.' Jeremy King, Arlington's dapper owner, is untroubled by the decline in sartorial standards. 'I hate dress codes,' he tells me.", "summary": "Seth Binzer, the frontman of American rap-rock group Crazy Town, was found dead in his Los Angeles home on Monday at the age 49.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13581871/EDEN-CONFIDENTIAL-Jasmine-Lennard-death-Crazy-Town-singer-Shifty-Shellshock.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/29/00/86717889-0-image-m-11_1719615827201.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:17:24", "author": "Editor,Richard Eden", "authors": ["Editor", "Richard Eden"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.051}

Oh my heavens. What a goal. What a move. Lemieux. Oh baby,\" Cole said excitedly after Lemieux went the length of the ice, skated through the defence pair of Shawn Chambers and Neil Wilkinson and deked goalie Jon Casey.\n\n\"I don't know when it's going to come out. No idea ... I don't plan it. It's spontaneous,\" he wrote in his autobiography. \"I don't script the thing. It's ad-libbed ... and that's what broadcasting's all about.\"\n\nRon MacLean the host of CBC's \"Hockey Night in Canada,\" said Cole's distinctive play-by-play style \"comes on you like smoke from a campfire.\"\n\nFellow broadcaster Greg Millen, a former NHL goaltender, said Cole's voice was \"almost like a symphony.\"\n\n\"Bob had an unbelievable ability of bringing the game up and down depending on what was happening on the ice.\"\n\nIn typical Cole fashion, he initially wondered ahead of doing the autobiography who would be interested in reading his story, \"just because I do hockey games.\"\n\nBut what games. He did the 1972 Summit Series on radio. On TV, there was the 1976 game in Philadelphia when the Soviet Red Army players left the ice in protest at the Flyers take-no-prisoners tactics. \"They're going home,\" said an incredulous Cole.\n\nHe was there for the 2002 Olympic final in Salt Lake City when Canada ended its 50-year Olympic gold-medal drought with a win over the United States in the final.\n\n\"Joe Sakic scores and that makes it 5-2 Canada. Surely that's got to be it?\" said Cole.\n\nNot to mention a string of Stanley Cup finals.\n\nBut Cole was more than hockey.\n\nHe called Bob Beamon's world-record long jump at the 1968 Olympics, curled in the Brier, served as quiz master on \"Reach for the Top\" and worked for the Newfoundland government.\n\nCole's Hockey Night in Canada swansong came April 6, 2019, the regular-season finale in Montreal between the Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs. Players, coaches and fans stood in appreciation to honour Cole in the second period as his four children, Christian, Hilary, Megan and Robbie, watched in the gondola at the Bell Centre.\n\n\"Thank you so much Montreal and Canada,\" he said to viewers, looking down from his perch. \"It's been a pleasure. I'm going to miss this.\"\n\nDon Cherry praised Cole during his Coach's Corner segment that night.\n\n\"Foster (Hewitt) was good, Danny (Gallivan) was good,\" Cherry said of Cole's HNIC predecessors. \"But the best of all, I think, and I've seen them all, is Bob Cole.\"\n\nNHL greats from Wayne Gretzky to Mark Messier and current stars Sidney Crosby and Connor McDavid as well as MacLean and Harry Neale, his former colour man, all feted Cole.\n\n\"Mr. Cole, congratulations on 50 great years of hockey. You were an inspiration to all of us in Canada,\" said Gretzky, adding \"Oh baby.\"\n\nIn his later years, Cole's broadcasting schedule was reduced by Rogers, which took over national TV rights via Sportsnet ahead of the 2014-15 season. He did 16 games his final season, up from the 10 originally planned.\n\n\"I wish it were more, but they've got a lot of guys in place,\" he said. \"They've got my phone number.\n\n\"I answer every time that it rings,\" he added dryly.\n\nCole counted family, flying, dogs, Broadway shows and fly-fishing among his loves.\n\nHis love for hockey started at a young age. At 11, he was bedridden for almost six months due to a knee injury suffered playing soccer.\n\nThe neighbourhood helped him collect Quaker Oats box tops for a promotion that involved photos of NHL players. With the photos spread out on his bed in line formations, he'd listen to the VONF radio broadcasts of games.\n\nHe listened to Hewitt bring the game alive. \"It was heaven for me,\" he told the CBC in a 2019 interview.\n\nYears later, he still had his own system for writing down the lines for use in the broadcast booth.\n\nHis first job in radio came in 1954 at VOCM in St. John's as a part-time news reader and DJ.\n\nHis life took a turn in 1956 when, on the way back from a trip to New York, the aspiring broadcaster decided to drop off a five-minute audition tape at Hewitt's Toronto radio station.\n\nTo Cole's surprise, Hewitt made time for him and listened to the tape right there and then. They spent some two hours together.\n\nHewitt's advice? Save the big call for the big play, use different voice levels and feel the flow of the game. It served Cole well.\n\nBeginning on radio, Cole looked to paint a picture with his calls.\n\n\"You've got to take over somebody's mind, try to get them into the building,\" he said.\n\nStarting in April 1969 doing an NHL playoff semifinal game in Boston on radio -- Jean Beliveau scored in double overtime to eliminate the Bruins -- Cole moved to TV in 1973.\n\nHis work routine never changed. For Saturday games, he flew in Friday and returned Sunday. He met the coaches the morning of the game to go over their lineups, had a nap in the afternoon, then returned to the rink to go to work.\n\nFifty years on, he said he still got goosebumps walking into the arena.\n\nCole was old-school. He talked while the action was on, leaving his colour analyst to chime in when play halted.\n\nNeale was one of his favourite broadcast partners. \"He loves the game and that showed up through every broadcast he ever made,\" said Neale\n\n\"We had a pretty good chemistry in the booth,\" Cole said.\n\nCole's signature calls, such as \"Desjardins! And the Canadiens win in overtime,\" in the 1993 Stanley Cup final, remain in demand.\n\n\"I've had guys in NHL dressing rooms come up with something like that. \"Give us that (Eric) Desjardins goal! C'mon Bob!\" Cole recalled.\n\nCole was honoured by the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1996 when he won the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award for outstanding contributions as a hockey broadcaster. In 2016, he was invested as a Member of the Order of Canada during a ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published April 25, 2024.\n\nNeil Davidson, The

He was 90.\n\nFriend and fellow broadcaster John Shannon said Cole died Wednesday night in his hometown of St. John's, the capital of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the network for which Cole worked, announced his death Thursday, adding daughter Megan said her father had been healthy \"up until the very end.\"\n\nKnown for his \"Oh baby!\" catchphrase, Cole called some iconic games as part of CBC's \"Hockey Night in Canada.\" His distinctive play-by-play style added even more flavor to the 1972 Summit Series between Canada and the Soviet Union, the 2002 Olympic final in Salt Lake City and numerous Stanley Cup Finals.\n\nCole called his first game, on radio, between Boston and Montreal in April 1969 and moved to TV in 1973. He called his last game on April 6, 2019 - the regular-season finale between the Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs - and in between was honored by the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1996, winning the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award for outstanding contributions as a hockey broadcaster.\n\nGreg Millen, a former NHL goaltender-turned-broadcaster, said Cole\u00b4s voice was \"almost like a symphony.\"\n\n\"Bob had an unbelievable ability of bringing the game up and down depending on what was happening on the ice,\" Millen said.\n\nFILE - Broadcaster Bob Cole poses prior to calling his last NHL hockey game between the Montreal Canadiens and the Toronto Maple Leafs in Montreal, Saturday, April 6, 2019.

Oh baby, what a life", "body": "Bob Cole, a welcome voice for Canadian hockey fans for a half-century, has died at the age of 90.\n\nCole died Wednesday night in St. John's, N.L., surrounded by his family, his daughter, Megan Cole, told the CBC.\n\nBorn June 24, 1933, the St. John's native provided a distinctive soundtrack to Canada's game. He was known for his signature \"Oh baby\" call, an expression that was not restricted to hockey arenas.\n\n\"He's been saying that around the house as long as I can remember,\" Megan said in Cole's 2016 autobiography \"Now I'm Catching On. My Life On and Off the Air.\"\n\nCole first remembers using it to describe some memorable Mario Lemieux stickhandling in Game 2 of the 1991 Stanley Cup final against Minnesota.\n\n\"Look at Lemieux. Oh my heavens. What a goal. What a move. Lemieux. Oh baby,\" Cole said excitedly after Lemieux went the length of the ice, skated through the defence pair of Shawn Chambers and Neil Wilkinson and deked goalie Jon Casey.\n\n\"I don't know when it's going to come out. No idea ... I don't plan it. It's spontaneous,\" he wrote in his autobiography. \"I don't script the thing. It's ad-libbed ... and that's what broadcasting's all about.\"\n\nRon MacLean the host of CBC's \"Hockey Night in Canada,\" said Cole's distinctive play-by-play style \"comes on you like smoke from a campfire.\"\n\nFellow broadcaster Greg Millen, a former NHL goaltender, said Cole's voice was \"almost like a symphony.\"\n\n\"Bob had an unbelievable ability of bringing the game up and down depending on what was happening on the ice.\"\n\nIn typical Cole fashion, he initially wondered ahead of doing the autobiography who would be interested in reading his story, \"just because I do hockey games.\"\n\nBut what games. He did the 1972 Summit Series on radio. On TV, there was the 1976 game in Philadelphia when the Soviet Red Army players left the ice in protest at the Flyers take-no-prisoners tactics. \"They're going home,\" said an incredulous Cole.\n\nHe was there for the 2002 Olympic final in Salt Lake City when Canada ended its 50-year Olympic gold-medal drought with a win over the United States in the final.\n\n\"Joe Sakic scores and that makes it 5-2 Canada. Surely that's got to be it?\" said Cole.\n\nNot to mention a string of Stanley Cup finals.\n\nBut Cole was more than hockey.\n\nHe called Bob Beamon's world-record long jump at the 1968 Olympics, curled in the Brier, served as quiz master on \"Reach for the Top\" and worked for the Newfoundland government.\n\nCole's Hockey Night in Canada swansong came April 6, 2019, the regular-season finale in Montreal between the Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs. Players, coaches and fans stood in appreciation to honour Cole in the second period as his four children, Christian, Hilary, Megan and Robbie, watched in the gondola at the Bell Centre.\n\n\"Thank you so much Montreal and Canada,\" he said to viewers, looking down from his perch. \"It's been a pleasure. I'm going to miss this.\"\n\nDon Cherry praised Cole during his Coach's Corner segment that night.\n\n\"Foster (Hewitt) was good, Danny (Gallivan) was good,\" Cherry said of Cole's HNIC predecessors. \"But the best of all, I think, and I've seen them all, is Bob Cole.\"\n\nNHL greats from Wayne Gretzky to Mark Messier and current stars Sidney Crosby and Connor McDavid as well as MacLean and Harry Neale, his former colour man, all feted Cole.\n\n\"Mr. Cole, congratulations on 50 great years of hockey. You were an inspiration to all of us in Canada,\" said Gretzky, adding \"Oh baby.\"\n\nIn his later years, Cole's broadcasting schedule was reduced by Rogers, which took over national TV rights via Sportsnet ahead of the 2014-15 season. He did 16 games his final season, up from the 10 originally planned.\n\n\"I wish it were more, but they've got a lot of guys in place,\" he said. \"They've got my phone number.\n\n\"I answer every time that it rings,\" he added dryly.\n\nCole counted family, flying, dogs, Broadway shows and fly-fishing among his loves.\n\nHis love for hockey started at a young age. At 11, he was bedridden for almost six months due to a knee injury suffered playing soccer.\n\nThe neighbourhood helped him collect Quaker Oats box tops for a promotion that involved photos of NHL players. With the photos spread out on his bed in line formations, he'd listen to the VONF radio broadcasts of games.\n\nHe listened to Hewitt bring the game alive. \"It was heaven for me,\" he told the CBC in a 2019 interview.\n\nYears later, he still had his own system for writing down the lines for use in the broadcast booth.\n\nHis first job in radio came in 1954 at VOCM in St. John's as a part-time news reader and DJ.\n\nHis life took a turn in 1956 when, on the way back from a trip to New York, the aspiring broadcaster decided to drop off a five-minute audition tape at Hewitt's Toronto radio station.\n\nTo Cole's surprise, Hewitt made time for him and listened to the tape right there and then. They spent some two hours together.\n\nHewitt's advice? Save the big call for the big play, use different voice levels and feel the flow of the game. It served Cole well.\n\nBeginning on radio, Cole looked to paint a picture with his calls.\n\n\"You've got to take over somebody's mind, try to get them into the building,\" he said.\n\nStarting in April 1969 doing an NHL playoff semifinal game in Boston on radio -- Jean Beliveau scored in double overtime to eliminate the Bruins -- Cole moved to TV in 1973.\n\nHis work routine never changed. For Saturday games, he flew in Friday and returned Sunday. He met the coaches the morning of the game to go over their lineups, had a nap in the afternoon, then returned to the rink to go to work.\n\nFifty years on, he said he still got goosebumps walking into the arena.\n\nCole was old-school. He talked while the action was on, leaving his colour analyst to chime in when play halted.\n\nNeale was one of his favourite broadcast partners. \"He loves the game and that showed up through every broadcast he ever made,\" said Neale\n\n\"We had a pretty good chemistry in the booth,\" Cole said.\n\nCole's signature calls, such as \"Desjardins! And the Canadiens win in overtime,\" in the 1993 Stanley Cup final, remain in demand.\n\n\"I've had guys in NHL dressing rooms come up with something like that. \"Give us that (Eric) Desjardins goal! C'mon Bob!\" Cole recalled.\n\nCole was honoured by the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1996 when he won the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award for outstanding contributions as a hockey broadcaster. In 2016, he was invested as a Member of the Order of Canada during a ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published April 25, 2024.\n\nNeil Davidson, The

Oh baby, what a life", "body": "Bob Cole, a welcome voice for Canadian hockey fans for a half-century, has died at the age of 90.\n\nBorn June 24, 1933, the St. John's, N.L., native provided a distinctive soundtrack to Canada's game. He was known for his signature \"Oh baby\" call, an expression that was not restricted to hockey arenas.\n\n\"He's been saying that around the house as long as I can remember,\" daughter Megan said in Cole's 2016 autobiography \"Now I'm Catching On. My Life On and Off the Air.\"\n\nCole first remembers using it to describe some memorable Mario Lemieux stickhandling in Game 2 of the 1991 Stanley Cup final against Minnesota.\n\n\"Look at Lemieux. Oh my heavens. What a goal. What a move. Lemieux. Oh baby,\" Cole said excitedly after Lemieux went the length of the ice, skated through the defence pair of Shawn Chambers and Neil Wilkinson and deked goalie Jon Casey.\n\n\"I don't know when it's going to come out. No idea \u0393\u00c7\u00aa I don't plan it. It's spontaneous,\" he wrote in his autobiography. \"I don't script the thing. It's ad-libbed \u0393\u00c7\u00aa and that's what broadcasting's all about.\"\n\nHockey Night in Canada host Ron MacLean said Cole's distinctive play-by-play style \"comes on you like smoke from a campfire.\"\n\nFellow broadcaster Greg Millen, a former NHL goaltender, said Cole's voice was \"almost like a symphony.\"\n\n\"Bob had an unbelievable ability of bringing the game up and down depending on what was happening on the ice.\"\n\nIn typical Cole fashion, he initially wondered ahead of doing the autobiography who would be interested in reading his story, \"just because I do hockey games.\"\n\nBut what games. He did the 1972 Summit Series on radio. On TV, there was the 1976 game in Philadelphia when the Soviet Red Army players left the ice in protest at the Flyers take-no-prisoners tactics. \"They're going home,\" said an incredulous Cole.\n\nHe was there for the 2002 Olympic final in Salt Lake City when Canada ended its 50-year Olympic gold-medal drought with a win over the United States in the final.\n\n\"Joe Sakic scores and that makes it 5-2 Canada. Surely that's got to be it?\" said Cole.\n\nHe called Bob Beamon's world-record long jump at the 1968 Olympics, curled in the Brier, served as quiz master on \"Reach for the Top\" and worked for the Newfoundland government.\n\nCole's Hockey Night in Canada swansong came April 6, 2019, the regular-season finale in Montreal between the Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs. Players, coaches and fans stood in appreciation to honour Cole in the second period as his four children, Christian, Hilary, Megan and Robbie, watched in the gondola at the Bell Centre.\n\n\"Thank you so much Montreal and Canada,\" he said to viewers, looking down from his perch. \"It's been a pleasure. I'm going to miss this.\"\n\nDon Cherry praised Cole during his Coach's Corner segment that night.\n\n\"Foster (Hewitt) was good, Danny (Gallivan) was good,\" Cherry said of Cole's HNIC predecessors. \"But the best of all, I think, and I've seen them all, is Bob Cole.\"\n\nNHL greats from Wayne Gretzky to Mark Messier and current stars Sidney Crosby and Connor McDavid as well as MacLean and Harry Neale, his former colour man, all feted Cole.\n\n\"Mr. Cole, congratulations on 50 great years of hockey. You were an inspiration to all of us in Canada,\" said Gretzky, adding \"Oh baby.\"\n\nIn his later years, Cole's broadcasting schedule was reduced by Rogers, which took over national TV rights via Sportsnet ahead of the 2014-15 season. He did 16 games his final season, up from the 10 originally planned.\n\n\"I wish it were more, but they've got a lot of guys in place,\" he said. \"They've got my phone number.\n\n\"I answer every time that it rings,\" he added dryly.\n\nCole counted family, flying, dogs, Broadway shows and fly-fishing among his loves.\n\nHis love for hockey started at a young age. At 11, he was bedridden for almost six months due to a knee injury suffered playing soccer.\n\nThe neighbourhood helped him collect Quaker Oats box tops for a promotion that involved photos of NHL players. With the photos spread out on his bed in line formations, he'd listen to the VONF radio broadcasts of games.\n\nHe listened to Hewitt bring the game alive. \"It was heaven for me,\" he told the CBC in a 2019 interview.\n\nYears later, he still had his own system for writing down the lines for use in the broadcast booth.\n\nHis first job in radio came in 1954 at VOCM in St. John's as a part-time news reader and DJ.\n\nHis life took a turn in 1956 when, on the way back from a trip to New York, the aspiring broadcaster decided to drop off a five-minute audition tape at Hewitt's Toronto radio station.\n\nTo Cole's surprise, Hewitt made time for him and listened to the tape right there and then. They spent some two hours together.\n\nHewitt's advice? Save the big call for the big play, use different voice levels and feel the flow of the game. It served Cole well.\n\nBeginning on radio, Cole looked to paint a picture with his calls.\n\n\"You've got to take over somebody's mind, try to get them into the building,\" he said.\n\nStarting in April 1969 doing an NHL playoff semifinal game in Boston on radio -- Jean Beliveau scored in double overtime to eliminate the Bruins -- Cole moved to TV in 1973.\n\nHis work routine never changed. For Saturday games, he flew in Friday and returned Sunday. He met the coaches the morning of the game to go over their lineups, had a nap in the afternoon, then returned to the rink to go to work.\n\nFifty years on, he said he still got goosebumps walking into the arena.\n\nCole was old-school. He talked while the action was on, leaving his colour analyst to chime in when play halted.\n\nNeale was one of his favourite broadcast partners. \"He loves the game and that showed up through every broadcast he ever made,\" said Neale\n\n\"We had a pretty good chemistry in the booth,\" Cole said.\n\nCole's signature calls, such as \"Desjardins! And the Canadiens win in overtime,\" in the 1993 Stanley Cup final, remain in demand.\n\n\"I've had guys in NHL dressing rooms come up with something like that. \"Give us that (Eric) Desjardins goal! C'mon Bob!\" Cole recalled.\n\nCole was honoured by the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1996 when he won the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award for outstanding contributions as a hockey broadcaster. In 2016, he was invested as a Member of the Order of Canada during a ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [],

It's all I associated with watching hockey growing up. He has a close spot in a lot of Canadians' hearts over the years, Steven Stamkos, captain of the Tampa Bay Lightning captain, said in 2019, when Cole called his final game (new window) -- a classic Original Six matchup between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Montreal Canadiens.\n\nThat was the guy you grew up listening to, Leafs captain John Tavares said at the time.\n\nAs Cole wound down his career that season, players would pay tributes, such as entire teams skating with their sticks raised high in the air.\n\nWell, well, well -- Ottawa, pretty classy. Thanks very much, an emotional Cole said as he commented on a Senators play made just for him.\n\nAlready a prominent figure in St. John's broadcasting, Cole leapt to national broadcasts in 1969 when he started calling NHL games for CBC Radio.\n\nHe moved to television in 1973 and was a staple of Hockey Night in Canada broadcasts for decades to come. He called many Stanley Cup final series over the years, and gave sports fans thrills with on-the-spot comments, some which have resonated for generations.\n\nWATCH | In 2019, as he prepared for his final broadcast, Bob Cole told Ian Hanomansing about being 'the soundtrack of Saturday night':\n\nLegendary broadcaster Bob Cole is preparing for his final sign-off. After 50 years in the booth, he is leaving Hockey Night in Canada on April 6.\n\nThey're going home, he repeatedly said on Jan. 11, 1976, when Russia's Red Army hockey team temporarily headed to the changing room during a heated match with the Philadelphia Flyers, then the reigning Stanley Cup champs.\n\nThe incident occurred during the first period, when Flyers defenceman Ed Van Impe, who had just finished serving a penalty, delivered a hard check on Valeri Kharlamov. The Russian star lay prone on the ice for several minutes, prompting Red Army coach Konstantin Loktev to pull his team off the ice in protest when no penalty was called. The Russian team would eventually return to finish the game.\n\nRooted in radio, Cole knew that what hockey fans heard could add to their enjoyment of the game.\n\nI get a great charge out of making exciting sound, if you want to call it that, he told The Canadian Press in a 2022 interview (new window), after he received a lifetime achievement award from the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television.\n\nIt's the feel of the game that got me started and I managed to hang onto that, I think, or tried to for so long.\n\nFor guidance on how to call a hockey game, Cole once went straight to the top with an audition tape: legendary broadcaster Foster Hewitt.\n\nInspired by Hewitt in his childhood -- radio was my everything, he told Ian Hanomansing in a 2019 interview -- Cole in his early 20s tracked down Hewitt in Toronto.\n\nWATCH | Bob Cole speaks with Here & Now's Debbie Cooper in 2016 about the life-changing advice he got from Foster Hewitt:\n\nHewitt not only agreed to listen to the tape but took Cole into the studio to give him feedback on the spot.\n\nIt was a dream you would never imagine could happen -- Foster Hewitt is talking to me about how he does, how he thinks about a hockey game, Cole said in 2016 interview with CBC to promote Now I'm Catching On: My Life On and Off the Air, a memoir he wrote with sportswriter Stephen Brunt.\n\nHockey was not the only sport Cole loved. He curled for many years, twice skipping teams that represented Newfoundland and Labrador at the Brier in the 1970s.\n\nWATCH | See highlights of Cole's career, played for Toronto Maple Leafs fans in 2019:\n\nThe Toronto Maple Leafs honour Bob Cole for his final call in Toronto.\n\nDuring his lengthy broadcasting career, he was also quiz master on CBC's Reach for the Top in Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\nHis voice appeared outside sports, too. Actor and producer Allan Hawco asked Cole to voice the recap intro heard at the beginning of most episodes of the series Republic of Doyle.", "source": {"uri": "ici.radio-canada.ca", "dataType":

He was 90.\n\nFriend and fellow broadcaster John Shannon said Cole died Wednesday night in his hometown of St. John's, the capital of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the network for which Cole worked, announced his death Thursday, adding daughter Megan said her father had been healthy \"up until the very end.\"\n\nKnown for his \"Oh baby!\" catchphrase, Cole called some iconic games as part of CBC's \"Hockey Night in Canada.\" His distinctive play-by-play style added even more flavor to the 1972 Summit Series between Canada and the Soviet Union, the 2002 Olympic final in Salt Lake City and numerous Stanley Cup Finals.\n\nCole called his first game, on radio, between Boston and Montreal in April 1969 and moved to TV in 1973. He called his last game on April 6, 2019 -- the regular-season finale between the Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs -- and in between was honored by the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1996, winning the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award for outstanding contributions as a hockey broadcaster.\n\nGreg Millen, a former NHL goaltender-turned-broadcaster, said Cole's voice was \"almost like a symphony.\"\n\n\"Bob had an unbelievable ability of bringing the game up and down depending on what was happening on the ice,\" Millen said.\n\nLeafs coach Sheldon Keefe opened his remarks between playoff games Thursday by passing along condolences to Cole's family.\n\n\"Someone who touched the game in so many ways, as an icon in our sport and the voice of hockey, not just in Toronto, but in our country,\" Keefe said.

Cole died in his hometown of St. John's, Newfoundland, surrounded by his family, according to the CBC.\n\n\"Like every hockey fan across the country, we are deeply saddened to hear of Bob Cole's passing,\" CBC executive vice president Barb Williams said in a statement to The Athletic. \"For over 50 years his magical voice made even a preseason game come alive with excitement, never mind 28 Stanley Cup finals and the iconic Gold medal game in 2002. What a gift he had. And, what a loss to the entire hockey community. Bob will always hold a special place in our hearts at CBC.\"\n\nCole's broadcasting career began at VOCM, a local radio station in St. John's before joining CBC Radio in 1969. In 1972 as a radio broadcaster, Cole called Paul Henderson's series-winning goal in the 1972 Summit Series pitting Canada against the Soviet Union. The longtime announcer then joined \"Hockey Night in Canada's\" television broadcasts in 1973, providing the soundtrack for numerous regular season, playoff and Stanley Cup final games until his last game on April 6, 2019, a regular-season finale featuring the Montreal Canadiens and the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\n\"I don't know that there's ever going to be another Bob Cole,\" his former broadcast partner Greg Millen said. \"There may be, but he had that ability to flow in a game. And stay out of the way and let the players do their thing. That's a bit of a lost art at times.\"\n\nCole was also a broadcaster for three Olympic Games, including Team Canada's senior men's team's triumph at the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City which ended a 50-year goal drought. It was also the site for one of Cole's most iconic calls of all time -- \"Jooooooee Sakic!\" -- on Joe Sakic's second goal of the game with a little over a minute to play in the gold-medal game.\n\nCole was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1996 after receiving the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award for broadcasting excellence. Hewitt, a long-time Hockey Night in Canada broadcaster, served as Cole's inspiration for broadcasting. Cole found Hewitt and had him listen to an audition tape, and Hewitt provided feedback in return.\n\nNot long after word of his death, the hockey world mourned.\n\n\"He was someone who touched the game in so many ways,\" Leafs coach Sheldon Keefe said. \"He's an icon in our sport and the voice of hockey not just in Toronto, but in our country. A sad day, for sure. Our thoughts with everyone.\"\n\nJohn Shannon, \"Hockey Night In Canada's\" long-time producer, first met Cole in 1977 when he was a $10 day runner for the show and when Cole was one of four voices on \"Hockey Night In Canada.\" The others were Jim Robson in Vancouver, Danny Gallivan in Montreal and Bill Hewitt in Toronto.\n\nCole ended up as a beloved national voice for \"Hockey Night in Canada,\" but when he was first hired, there was an initial pushback from fans, who'd become accustomed to Hewitt and Gallivan's voices. Generally speaking, listeners like to hear a familiar, reassuring voice, which Cole eventually became. But in the beginning, it took time for audiences to adjust.\n\n\"This was a natural progression for a lot of us internally at 'Hockey Night' that we needed to have,\" said Shannon, \"which I would describe as a network voice versus the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs or the voice of the Montreal Canadiens. So, Bob became that transition guy. There was pushback a little bit in Toronto, you're right. There was pushback a little in Montreal as well.\n\n\"How we approached it at 'Hockey Night' was, the bigger the game got, it became important to have someone who did a Montreal game that wasn't viewed as a Montreal announcer. Similarly, in Toronto, (they weren't) viewed as a Toronto announcer, but was viewed as 'Hockey Night' in Canada's announcer.\n\nSince then, Cole's iconic calls on \"Hockey Night in Canada,\" including his signature \"Oh baby!\" and \"Everything is happening!\" have become staples of Canadian hockey lore. His baritone voice, as described by Shannon, was also part of his legend.\n\n\"Quite honestly growing up, I think every memory I would have of hockey would be with his voice echoing,\" Keefe said. \"I think it's very identifiable. One syllable, and you know it's Bob Cole. I just know that I have many friends and many people that loved the games that Bob called and how he called them and the passion that he had. With a career like he had, I don't think there's one particular moment. I think we would all say that he was there for all of them.\"\n\n\"The other thing about him was, nobody had a greater sense of anticipation about the game,\" Shannon said. \"The puck is in the neutral zone and Bob would say, 'Here they come!' or 'Watch out!' -- and you had to pay attention because nine out of 10 times he was right. Something was about to happen. That's what differentiated him from most of the other guys -- his true sense of anticipation.\n\n\"He viewed himself as an entertainer. He was theatrical. He knew how to use his voice. I teach guys how to do play-by-play -- and Bob Cole is the lead example because a goal in the first period isn't as important as a goal in the second period or the third period. He could convey that, with his voice intonation and his timber, so that you know, when he said, 'Scores!' oh that was an important goal. He was tremendous.\"\n\nMillen's favorite memories are watching Cole games where you'd only hear his voice, taking command of a broadcast. He remembers being \"lectured\" by Cole before games they'd work together, usually in a cab ride on the way to the rink with Cole sitting in the front seat.\n\n\"Let's not get in the way of the game tonight. Let it go,\" Millen recounts. \"And it was his way of saying, I'm doing this game. And you come in when I'll tell you.\"\n\nShannon said that Cole's passions included the New York Yankees, Frank Sinatra and his four children -- Robbie, Meghan, Hillary and Kristen.\n\n\"He talked about them as much as he talked about the game,\" Shannon said. \"He never left St. John's. Always lived in Newfoundland. But he was always able to maintain that sense of balance between family and work. He was a remarkable guy. To me, he was the soundtrack of hockey for more than a few generations.\n\n\"He was passionate about the game. He wanted to do it right. He was demanding. He was hard -- but no one had a better sense of the moment. Dan Kelly and Bob Cole. Those two. If he said, 'and the crowd goes crazy!' -- you knew we weren't going to hear another word for another 15 seconds because Bob is saying, 'OK, everybody, we're going to listen.' That's what Bob did. Bob was as good as they got.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Over the course of his Hockey Hall of Fame career - which began on CBC radio in 1969 and continued until his retirement in 2019 - Cole was famous for his colorful turns of phrase and obvious affection for the sport.\n\nThe best hockey broadcasters often let the game speak for itself. Cole was the master of his craft, always sensing the right time to pause and the right time to speak up and capture the moment with a memorable phrase.\n\nOne of his best-remembered moments was the regular use of the phrase \"oh, baby!\" - a simple enough communication that perfectly conveyed the drama of hockey games at their best. When the emotion of the moment ratcheted up, Cole expertly caught it and passed it along to viewers and listeners. He knew what his role was and excelled at it.\n\nRelated: 'Oh Baby!' -- Remembering Bob Cole's Top 5 Calls of All-Time\n\nCole spent most of his career as the lead play-by-play man for Hockey Night In Canada, and he continued to perform on the show - as well as during the Olympics and World Cups of Hockey - until he was 85 years old.\n\nMost people remember Cole for his broadcasting prowess, but he was also a competitive curler who represented his hometown province of Newfoundland in the 1971 and 1975 Briars. Yet he was world-famous for his talents in describing the ups and downs of hockey.\n\nAlong with longtime color analyst partner Harry Neale, Cole was front and center for scores of Stanley Cup playoff games, as well as each and every NHL regular season for half a century. Another classic Cole moment took place in the 1972 Summit Series, where he deftly captured the passion of the moment during Paul Henderson's series-winning goal.\n\nCole's cadence and feel for the game was what separated him from most of his peers, and he was a staple at Maple Leaf Gardens, Scotiabank Arena and scores of other hockey buildings across Canada. Indeed, over the years, Cole became a Canadian icon in his own right, with many impersonators paying homage to his singular style. Nobody did it the way Cole did, and the hockey world is poorer for his loss.\n\nMegan Cole told CBC News Thursday her father was healthy \"up until the very end.\" And while it's a sad day for hockey in Canada and around the world, there is some consolation in knowing that Cole's voice and legacy will resonate across the generations for years to come. Nobody was better at creating drama with only their voice, and Cole - who was honored by the Hall of Fame in 1996 as a recipient of the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award for broadcasting excellence - earned every laurel he received. He also won a Gemini Award for sports play-by-play, and in 2022, he was honored by the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television with their lifetime achievement award.\n\n\"I get a great charge out of making exciting sound, if you want to call it that,\" Cole told The Canadian Press in 2022. \"It's the feel of the game that got me started and I managed to hang onto that, I think, or tried to for so long.\"\n\nThere was nobody quite like Cole, and there won't soon come another of his ilk. He wore his love for hockey on his sleeve, and the game - and its fans and players - loved him back just as much. The Hockey Newsoffers its condolences to his family, friends and colleagues.", "source": {"uri": "fresnobee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Fresno Bee"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_proteau@fresnobee.com", "name": "Adam Proteau", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Cole_(sportscaster)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Cole (sportscaster)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sports commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hockey Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC_Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBC Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Neale", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Neale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summit Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Color commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_Night_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hockey Night in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Curling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_and_Labrador", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newfoundland and Labrador"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newfoundland and Labrador"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotiabank_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotiabank Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_Hewitt_Memorial_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foster Hewitt Memorial Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Henderson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Henderson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Canadian_Cinema_&_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_Leaf_Gardens", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maple Leaf Gardens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gemini Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canadian_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Canadian Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/History", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Street_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Street Hockey", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Hockey", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/rzscp5/picture288016985/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/e6132a81-0881-496e-9ac3-25d45a1ee2f7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9513342", "eventUri": "eng-9513342", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Oh baby, what a life - Medicine Hat News", "body": "SUBSCRIBE NOW Bob Cole, a welcome voice for Canadian hockey fans for a half-century, has died at the age of 90. Born June 24, 1933, the St. John's, N.L., native provided a distinctive soundtrack to Canada's game. He was known for his signature \"Oh baby\" call, an expression that was not restricted to hockey arenas. \"He's been saying that around the house as long as I can remember,\" daughter Megan said in Cole's 2016 autobiography \"Now I'm Catching On. My Life On and Off the Air.\" Cole first remembers using it to describe some memorable Mario Lemieux stickhandling in Game 2 of the 1991 Stanley Cup final against Minnesota. \"Look at Lemieux. Oh my heavens. What a goal. What a move. Lemieux. Oh baby,\"\u009d Cole said excitedly after Lemieux went the length of the ice, skated through the defence pair of Shawn Chambers and Neil Wilkinson and deked goalie Jon Casey. \"I don't know when it's going to come out. No idea \"| I don't plan it. It's spontaneous,\"\u009d he wrote in his autobiography. \"I don't script the thing. It's ad-libbed \"| and that's what broadcasting's all about.\"\u009d Hockey Night in Canada host Ron MacLean said Cole's distinctive play-by-play style \"comes on you like smoke from a campfire.\"\u009d Fellow broadcaster Greg Millen, a former NHL goaltender, said Cole's voice was \"almost like a symphony.\" \"Bob had an unbelievable ability of bringing the game up and down depending on what was happening on the ice.\" In typical Cole fashion, he initially wondered ahead of doing the autobiography who would be interested in reading his story, \"just because I do hockey games.\" But what games. He did the 1972 Summit Series on radio. On TV, there was the 1976 game in Philadelphia when the Soviet Red Army players left the ice in protest at the Flyers take-no-prisoners tactics. \"They're going home,\" said an incredulous Cole. He was there for the 2002 Olympic final in Salt Lake City when Canada ended its 50-year Olympic gold-medal drought with a win over the United States in the final. \"Joe Sakic scores and that makes it 5-2 Canada. Surely that's got to be it?\" said Cole. Not to mention a string of Stanley Cup finals. But Cole was more than hockey. He called Bob Beamon's world-record long jump at the 1968 Olympics, curled in the Brier, served as quiz master on \"Reach for the Top\"\u009d and worked for the Newfoundland government. Cole's Hockey Night in Canada swansong came April 6, 2019, the regular-season finale in Montreal between the Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs. Players, coaches and fans stood in appreciation to honour Cole in the second period as his four children, Christian, Hilary, Megan and Robbie, watched in the gondola at the Bell Centre. \"Thank you so much Montreal and Canada,\" he said to viewers, looking down from his perch. \"It's been a pleasure. I'm going to miss this.\" Don Cherry praised Cole during his Coach's Corner segment that night. \"Foster (Hewitt) was good, Danny (Gallivan) was good,\" Cherry said of Cole's HNIC predecessors. \"But the best of all, I think, and I've seen them all, is Bob Cole.\" NHL greats from Wayne Gretzky to Mark Messier and current stars Sidney Crosby and Connor McDavid as well as MacLean and Harry Neale, his former colour man, all feted Cole. \"Mr. Cole, congratulations on 50 great years of hockey. You were an inspiration to all of us in Canada,\" said Gretzky, adding \"Oh baby.\" In his later years, Cole's broadcasting schedule was reduced by Rogers, which took over national TV rights via Sportsnet ahead of the 2014-15 season. He did 16 games his final season, up from the 10 originally planned. \"I wish it were more, but they've got a lot of guys in place,\"\u009d he said. \"They've got my phone number. \"I answer every time that it rings,\"\u009d he added dryly. Cole counted family, flying, dogs, Broadway shows and fly-fishing among his loves. His love for hockey started at a young age. At 11, he was bedridden for almost six months due to a knee injury suffered playing soccer. The neighbourhood helped him collect Quaker Oats box tops for a promotion that involved photos of NHL players. With the photos spread out on his bed in line formations, he'd listen to the VONF radio broadcasts of games. He listened to Hewitt bring the game alive. \"It was heaven for me,\" he told the CBC in a 2019 interview. Years later, he still had his own system for writing down the lines for use in the broadcast booth. His first job in radio came in 1954 at VOCM in St. John's as a part-time news reader and DJ. His life took a turn in 1956 when, on the way back from a trip to New York, the aspiring broadcaster decided to drop off a five-minute audition tape at Hewitt's Toronto radio station. To Cole's surprise, Hewitt made time for him and listened to the tape right there and then. They spent some two hours together. Hewitt's advice? Save the big call for the big play, use different voice levels and feel the flow of the game. It served Cole well. Beginning on radio, Cole looked to paint a picture with his calls. \"You've got to take over somebody's mind, try to get them into the building,\"\u009d he said. Starting in April 1969 doing an NHL playoff semifinal game in Boston on radio - Jean Beliveau scored in double overtime to eliminate the Bruins - Cole moved to TV in 1973. His work routine never changed. For Saturday games, he flew in Friday and returned Sunday. He met the coaches the morning of the game to go over their lineups, had a nap in the afternoon, then returned to the rink to go to work. Fifty years on, he said he still got goosebumps walking into the arena. Cole was old-school. He talked while the action was on, leaving his colour analyst to chime in when play halted. Neale was one of his favourite broadcast partners. \"He loves the game and that showed up through every broadcast he ever made,\" said Neale \"We had a pretty good chemistry in the booth,\"\u009d Cole said. Cole's signature calls, such as \"Desjardins! And the Canadiens win in overtime,\"\u009d in the 1993 Stanley Cup final, remain in demand. \"I've had guys in NHL dressing rooms come up with something like that. \"Give us that (Eric) Desjardins goal! C'mon Bob!\"\u009d Cole recalled. Cole was honoured by the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1996 when he won the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award for outstanding contributions as a hockey broadcaster. In 2016, he was invested as a Member of the Order of Canada during a ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa.

It's all I associated with watching hockey growing up. He has a close spot in a lot of Canadians' hearts over the years,\" Steven Stamkos, captain of the Tampa Bay Lightning captain, said in 2019, when Cole called his final game -- a classic Original Six matchup between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Montreal Canadiens.\n\n\"That was the guy you grew up listening to,\" Leafs captain John Tavares said at the time.\n\nAs Cole wound down his career that season, players would pay tributes, such as entire teams skating with their sticks raised high in the air.\n\n\"Well, well, well -- Ottawa, pretty classy. Thanks very much,\" an emotional Cole said as he commented on a Senators play made just for him.\n\nAlready a prominent figure in St. John's broadcasting, Cole leapt to national broadcasts in 1969 when he started calling NHL games for CBC Radio.\n\nHe moved to television in 1973 and was a staple of Hockey Night in Canada broadcasts for decades to come. He called many Stanley Cup final series over the years, and gave sports fans thrills with on-the-spot comments, some which have resonated for generations.\n\n\"They're going home,\" he repeatedly said on Jan. 11, 1976, when Russia's Red Army hockey team temporarily headed to the changing room during a heated match with the Philadelphia Flyers, then the reigning Stanley Cup champs.\n\nThe incident occurred during the first period, when Flyers defenceman Ed Van Impe, who had just finished serving a penalty, delivered a hard check on Valeri Kharlamov. The Russian star lay prone on the ice for several minutes, prompting Red Army coach Konstantin Loktev to pull his team off the ice in protest when no penalty was called. The Russian team would eventually return to finish the game.\n\nRooted in radio, Cole knew that what hockey fans heard could add to their enjoyment of the game.\n\n\"I get a great charge out of making exciting sound, if you want to call it that,\" he told The Canadian Press in a 2022 interview, after he received a lifetime achievement award from the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television.\n\n\"It's the feel of the game that got me started and I managed to hang onto that, I think, or tried to for so long.\"\n\nFor guidance on how to call a hockey game, Cole once went straight to the top with an audition tape: legendary broadcaster Foster Hewitt.\n\nInspired by Hewitt in his childhood -- \"radio was my everything,\" he told Ian Hanomansing in a 2019 interview -- Cole in his early 20s tracked down Hewitt in Toronto.\n\nHewitt not only agreed to listen to the tape but took Cole into the studio to give him feedback on the spot.\n\n\"It was a dream you would never imagine could happen -- Foster Hewitt is talking to me about how he does, how he thinks about a hockey game,\" Cole said in 2016 interview with CBC to promote Now I'm Catching On: My Life On and Off the Air, a memoir he wrote with sportswriter Stephen Brunt.\n\nHockey was not the only sport Cole loved. He curled for many years, twice skipping teams that represented Newfoundland and Labrador at the Brier in the 1970s.\n\nDuring his lengthy broadcasting career, he was also quiz master on CBC's Reach for the Top in Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\nHis voice appeared outside sports, too. Actor and producer Allan Hawco asked Cole to voice the recap intro heard at the beginning of most episodes of the series Republic of Doyle.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title":

He was 90 years old.\n\nI had the pleasure of speaking with Mr. Cole several times during my career. Our last conversation was in April, 2018, after he had been told that he would not be calling playoff games for Hockey Night In Canada.\n\nIt was a decision that hurt Mr. Cole, who never wanted to retire, much less stop calling games. As he told me back then, \"I will miss it.\" And I speak for all hockey fans when I say, that his voice has been missed. But it will never be forgotten.\n\nNo one calls games like Mr. Cole did. His staccato delivery and familiar phrasings are part of hockey's lexicon. There was poetry in how he described a play. He added drama and gravitas to what you were watching -- what he was watching -- in a way that didn't sound forced or manufactured or planned. He was unique. But he was also passionate. And that passion shone through over the years, as Mr. Cole narrated some of hockey's biggest moments.\n\nHere is a Top-5 of Bob Cole's most famous calls, including his final send-off at Toronto's Maple Leafs Garden, where he appropriately ended things by saying: \"Well folks, that's it for here.\"\n\n1. Doug Gilmour's wraparound goal against the Blues in the 1993 playoffs\n\n\"Gilmour back of the net, Andreychuk in front with Borschevsky. It is Gilmour waiting, waiting, around the net, waiting -- he's open! Gilmour! Solo job! And he's won it, in a second overtime period. How. About. That. Oh my. Oh my. What a night, tonight, for the Toronto Maple Leafs.\"\n\n2. Eric Desjardins' overtime goal against the Kings in the 1993 final\n\n\"Desjardins following the play and he misses with the short side and there he is again -- scores! Desjardins! And the Canadiens win in overtime. His third goal of the game. And the series is a brand new one.\"\n\n3. Mario Lemieux's breakaway goal against the North Stars in the 1991 playoffs\n\n\"Here's Lemieux to centre -- penalty coming up -- look at Lemieux! Oh my goodness! What a goal! What a move! Lemieux! Oh, baby!\"\n\n4. Erik Karlsson sets up Derrick Brassard in overtime\n\n\"Keeps it onside, good work by Karlsson -- look at him skate -- passes, scores! Wow. What a play! What a play by the captain. What. A. Play.\"\n\n5. The final game at Maple Leaf Gardens\n\n\"Some have said the book is closing tonight. The crowd is cheering tonight. Oh, wait a minute, as Leafs president Ken Dryden said the other day, the book has not closed, it's not the end.\n\n\"I like what he said, it's the end of a chapter, maybe. And look at this crowd, appreciating this last moment at Maple Leafs Gardens. It certainly will be a brand new chapter. It will begin a week from tonight at the Air Canada Centre. And I'm sure the Maple Leafs and their fans are thinking precisely that.\n\n\"Forty-nine seconds in this third period. This great and admired lady has been just fine since 1931, thank you. While times change and things must go on. The first game, next week at the Air Canada Centre.

Broadcaster Cole, a welcome voice for Canadian hockey fans for a half-century, has died at the age of 90. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Graham HughesMembers of the NHL community and beyond paid tribute Bob Cole on Thursday after the legendary broadcaster died at age 90. He died Wednesday night in St. John's, N.L., surrounded by his family, his daughter, Megan Cole, told the CBC. Cole, an influential voice in broadcasting for more than half a century, brought life to some of hockey's biggest games. TNT hockey broadcaster Ed Olczyk, a former Winnipeg Jets and Toronto Maple Leafs forward, reminisced about admiring Bob Cole's big-game presence during his time playing in Canada. \"Just a super genuine hockey lover,\" Olcyzk said Thursday in Denver, where the Colorado Avalanche and the Jets were preparing to continue a first-round series on Friday. \"Obviously his call is so connected to 'Hockey Night in Canada.' Having played six years in Winnipeg and three years in Toronto, any time that he would walk into the room, you knew it was a big game. Just a great man.\" Avalanche star defenceman Cale Makar was a rookie when Cole called his last games during the 2018-19 season, but he strongly admired Cole's legacy. \"He was such a legendary announcer and such an awesome human being,\" Makar said. \"That's a tough loss for the hockey world.\" Avalanche superstar forward Nathan MacKinnon remembers Cole as \"an amazing person.\" \"Super funny and just a great guy,\" MacKinnon said. \"Some of the best calls of all time.\" Toronto Maple Leafs head coach Sheldon Keefe called Cole an \"icon.\" \"Someone who touched the game in so many ways,\" Keefe said in Toronto, where the Maple Leafs were preparing for Game 4 of their series on Saturday. \"The voice of hockey not just in Toronto, but in our country.\" Cole's reach extended beyond hockey. He skipped Newfoundland at the 1971 Brier and 1975 Canadian men's curling championship, served as quiz master on \"Reach for the Top\"\u009d and worked for the Newfoundland government. \"I think he's going to be remembered as a Newfoundlander that really made it on a big scale,\" said six-time Brier champion Brad Gushue, who also hails from St. John's.

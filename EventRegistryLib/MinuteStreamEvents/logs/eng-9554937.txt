Sinclair owns or operates 185 TV stations in 86 markets.\n\nThe stations are a mix of affiliates including Fox, NBC, ABC, CBS and the CW. If sold together, their average revenue for 2023 and 2024 is an estimated $1.56 billion, the people said. Sinclair is willing to sell all or some of the stations, which are in top markets like Minneapolis; Portland, Ore.; Pittsburgh; Austin, Texas and Fresno, Calif., among others.\n\nSinclair CEO Chris Ripley said Wednesday that the company is open to offloading parts of its business, without providing specifics.\n\n\"As we've always stated, we have no sacred cows,\" Ripley said during his company's earnings conference call. \"We want to unlock the sum of the parts valuation that we think we're grossly undervalued for. And to the extent that asset sales makes sense in order to unlock that value and help us de-lever, then that's something that we'd be open to as well.\"\n\nThe company began officially shopping them in February, one of the people said.\n\nSpokespeople for Sinclair and Moelis declined to comment.\n\nSinclair is also exploring options for its Tennis Channel, a cable TV network that features the sport and pickleball matches, the people said. Bloomberg earlier reported that development.\n\nBroadcast TV station groups have suffered in the past five years as millions of Americans have canceled traditional pay TV. Most stations make money from so-called retransmission fees, paid on a per-subscriber rate by traditional TV distributors, such as Comcast, DirecTV, and Charter, for the right to carry the stations.\n\nSinclair has lost more than 70% of its market value in the last five years. The company's market capitalization is about $975 million with an enterprise value of about $4.7 billion.\n\nSinclair changes\n\nLast year, Sinclair rebranded and reorganized, splitting the company into two operating units -- Local Media, which focuses on the stations, and Ventures, which houses Tennis Channel but can also act as an investment vehicle.\n\nThe split in the company divisions, and the recent sale process for some of its stations, stems from tension within the Smith family, the shareholders and the board directors who helped build Sinclair, some of the people said.\n\nThe stations are up for sale in the months before the 2024 election, which usually draws high political advertising revenue for broadcast TV companies. Sinclair said during earnings on Wednesday that it pre-booked $77 million in political advertising for the second half of the year through Election Day, compared with $21 million at the same point in 2020, the last time former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden were on the ticket.\n\nThe company's overall revenue and advertising revenue both rose slightly during the first quarter. Sinclair's stock was up 12% on Thursday.\n\nSinclair's broadcast stations have been known for having a conservative editorial voice, and the company faced backlash in 2018 after requiring some of its stations to read promos criticizing the media about \"fake stories.\"\n\nDiamond woes\n\nThe process also comes after Sinclair faced headaches in the regional sports networks business.\n\nSinclair acquired the largest portfolio of regional sports networks from Disney in 2019 for $10.6 billion, including $8.8 billion in debt. Between ramped-up cord-cutting and the hefty debt load, Diamond Sports, the independently run and unconsolidated subsidiary of Sinclair, sought bankruptcy protection last year.\n\nDiamond later sued parent Sinclair, and the litigation was settled in January. Sinclair made a $495 million payment to settle lawsuits related to Diamond.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Later in Thursday's session, CNBC reported that the company was considering selling about 30% of its broadcast stations.\n\nSinclair delivers a strong profit\n\nSinclair, which owns or has relationships with 185 television stations in 86 markets including all three major broadcast networks, said that revenue in its first quarter ticked up 3% to $798 million, which was just shy of estimates of $801.3 million. Advertising revenue in the quarter rose 4% to $321 million, though ad revenue was down 4% excluding political ads. Distribution revenue increased by 2% to $436 million.\n\nThat growth translated into adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increasing 13% to $136 million. This is a sign that Sinclair's mix of local broadcasting, regional sports, and streaming news content continues to deliver results.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nOn the bottom line, earnings per share was $0.35, which easily beat expectations for a loss of $0.29.\n\nWhile the stock was up on the earnings report, it got a boost after CNBC said during the afternoon that the company could sell more than 30% of its broadcast stations. According to the report, Sinclair is working with investment banker Moelis and has identified more than 60 stations it could sell, though it's not clear what they would be worth.\n\nOn theearnings call CEO Chris Ripley said: \"We want to unlock the sum of the parts valuation that we think we're grossly undervalued for. And to the extent that asset sales make sense in order to unlock that value and help us de-lever, then that's something we'd be open to.\"\n\nWhat's next for Sinclair\n\nFor the current quarter, Sinclair expects revenue to improve to $823 million-$843 million and sees adjusted EBITDA of $132 million-$155 million. Election years are typically a boon for broadcast television stations, and Sinclair looks ready to capitalize on it as it's pre-booked $77 million of political advertising by May 1, well ahead of 2020 and 2022 levels.\n\nSinclair also has more than $4 billion in debt on the balance sheet, so selling those stations would help pay it down.

The movie stars the beloved A-list heartthrob Glen Powell as a college professor who freelances for the police as a fake hitman who helps entrap people who hire him. The premise is bizarre but the film is based on a real-life story and a real man named Gary Johnson who worked undercover for the police for years. The real-life fake hitman helped the police make over 70 arrests and likely saved many people who may have otherwise met a grisly end. The original Netflix series added a romantic line to this true story with the introduction of the character Madison (played by Adria Anjona). A welcome addition as the Star Wars actress and the Anyone But You lead share palpable on-screen chemistry. The movie had drama, action, love, humour, mystery, and comedy \u2013 a combination that has thrilled fans who have loved this one hour 55-minute film.

Joerussotweets said on X that the film might be \u2018the best movie of 2024\u2019. \u2018Just saw Richard Linklater\u2019s HIT MAN the way it SHOULD be seen \u2014 on the big screen \u2014 and, MAN, does it HIT. \u2018It\u2019s a perfect vehicle for Glen Powell. He\u2019s a f**ing movie star. It just may be the best movie of 2024. It\u2019s such a crime you\u2019ll have to stream it,\u2019 they said. BrandonSiedlik also commented: \u2018#HitMan further proves that Glen Powell is a certified movie star. I think of him not as the last of a dying breed, but one of the first of a new generation. \u2018This a remarkable performance filled with charisma and (in brief segments) displays immense range in a single role.\u2019 I woke up this morning and while I was getting ready I remembered Hit Man came out on Netflix, so I threw it on and wound up watching the first 30 minutes again. Richard Linklater and Glen Powell wrote a damn near perfect screenplay and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so immediately apparent. pic.twitter.com/5pxpAKC9Ym\u2014 Rolo Tony (@PoorOldRoloTony) June 7, 2024 Others were also quick to compliment the lead actor, who morphed into several aliases during the movie as he wore wigs and different costumes to portray different killer identities. Brockwilbur commented on X: \u2018Hit Man is worth watching just for the scene of Glen Powell doing his best Patrick Bateman.\u2019 Hit Man is worth watching just for the scene of Glen Powell doing his best Patrick Bateman. pic.twitter.com/6sSkRt27Dx\u2014 Brock Wilbur (@brockwilbur) June 8, 2024 If Tilda Swinton Glen Powell isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t your favorite Glen Powell in Hit Man, what are you doing with your life? pic.twitter.com/wuPsgov2fR\u2014 Brandon Lewis (@blewis1103) June 7, 2024 I feel like they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t market Hit Man as a romance/rom com but girlies\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.. it is.\u2014 Sophia Benoit (@1followernodad) June 2, 2024 Ali_sivi commented: \u2018I\u2019m so sorry to type this sentence during pride month but Glen Powell stuns in hit man.\u2019 1followernodad: \u2018I feel like they didn\u2019t market Hit Man as a romance/rom com but girlies\u2026.. it is.\u2019 A common complaint from fans is that this film was deserving of a bigger theatrical reception and should have premiered at a cinema rather than a streaming platform. However, the praise for Glen\u2019s performance is unanimous as reviews pour in to praise his acting and hilarity in this leading role. Got a story?

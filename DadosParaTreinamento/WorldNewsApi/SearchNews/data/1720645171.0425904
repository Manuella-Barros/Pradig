Role, Privileges of the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament Being the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha is a crucial role that brings some privileges and responsibilities. However, to be eligible for this role, a party needs to have at least 10 percent of the total seats in the Lok Sabha. Moreover, the LoP is a member of crucial committees such as Public Accounts, Public Undertakings, and Estimates. They take part in various Joint Parliamentary panels, playing a key role in selection committees that are responsible for the appointment of heads of central agencies like the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). In addition, they\u2019re involved in choosing chiefs of statutory bodies such as the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) and the Central Information Commission (CIC). The Opposition Leader is also entitled to a salary and perks, much like a Cabinet Minister. This includes allowances and privileges specifically formulated to facilitate them as they fulfill their duties effectively. In the past 10 years, the post of LoP had remained vacant as no Opposition was able to secure 10 percent of the Lok Sabha seats.", "summary": "Congress Working Committee (CWC) passed a resolution to appoint its former chief Rahul Gandhi as the Leader of the Opposition (LoP) in the Lok Sabha.", "url": "https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-congress-rahul-gandhi-likely-to-be-leader-of-opposition-in-lok-sabha-know-role-privileges-of-lop-3092687", "image": "https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/half/public/2024/06/08/2637386-1200900-2024-06-08t212236.390.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:18:39", "author": "Pavan Naidu", "authors": ["Pavan Naidu"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.042}

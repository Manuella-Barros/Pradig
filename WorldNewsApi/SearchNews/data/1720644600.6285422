{"id": 231230006, "title": "Rishi Sunak snubs press during campaign visit after D-Day fallout", "text": "The Prime Minister did not take questions from the press as planned during a visit to the North East today (June 8). Rishi Sunak visited a walled garden at Auckland Castle in Bishop Auckland on a campaign trail stop on Saturday. But an opportunity for the media to put questions to him did not take place as was originally planned, ChronicleLive reports. The change of plan follows the fallout on Friday (June 7) of his early return from D-Day commemorations in Normandy. He went on to apologise, saying 'it was a mistake' not to stay in France for the international event after attending the British ceremony in Normandy.

He also watered plants with Jane MacBean, Conservative candidate for Bishop Auckland. Members of the public could be seen gathered at a hillside above the garden to try and catch a glimpse of the Prime Minister within. Mr Sunak came under intense criticism after it emerged he missed the D-Day event with fellow world leaders to head back to the UK for an ITV interview. The Prime Minister said: \"I care deeply about veterans and have been honoured to represent the UK at a number of events in Portsmouth and France over the past two days and to meet those who fought so bravely. After the conclusion of the British event in Normandy, I returned back to the UK. On reflection, it was a mistake not to stay in France longer - and I apologise.\" The Prime Minister attended the UK national event at Portsmouth on Wednesday (June 4) and then the British ceremony in Normandy on Thursday, the anniversary of the allied landings on D-Day. But he left France before world leaders including US President Joe Biden gathered for the main international ceremony on Thursday afternoon (June 5). Instead, Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron was the senior UK minister at the event.", "summary": "The press was unable to question the Prime Minister", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/rishi-sunak-snubs-press-during-29317775", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29317801.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_General-Election-campaign-2024.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:59:15", "author": "David Huntley,Joseph Timan", "authors": ["David Huntley", "Joseph Timan"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.193}
